"3","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Thank's, Mac. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We ended a solid first half of the year and we continue on our exciting journey towards moving beyond smoking. We completed our acquisition of NJOY and delivered strong business results, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 5% in the first half and we returned $3.8 billion to share holders, while investing in infrastructure [Indecipherable]. We look forward to executing our commercialization plan for NJOY in the second half of the year. And we reaffirm our guidance to deliver 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.89 to $5.03. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS run rate of 1% to 4 % from a $4.84 base in 2022.

My remarks this morning will focus on three topics; our enhanced smoke-free product portfolio including our recent acquisition of NJOY, the consumer dynamic impacting our core tobacco business and an update on the California flavor ban and its impact on the market. I'll then turn it over to Sal, who will provide further details on our business and financial results.

Let's begin with e-vapor, which has been the most successful category in the U.S. in transitioning smokers to alternative products. In June, we took a transformative step towards our goal to moving beyond smoking by completing our acquisition of NJOY. We are quite focused on responsibly accelerating U.S. smoker and vapor adoption of NJOY ACE. Currently, the only pod-based e-vapor product with marketing authorization from the FDA.

The integration and business plans are already well underway and we welcome the NJOY team to the Altria family of companies. They bring a wealth of knowledge and capabilities that complement our own, such as vapor product development, device manufacturing partnerships and international supply chain expertise. We believe their skills will accelerate our progress towards our vision and we're excited to build on their recent experience operating in this category.

[Indecipherable] limited visibility and frequent [Indecipherable] makes it difficult for the NJOY team to communicate offers and build awareness of the [Indecipherable] stores. If fact, like our [Indecipherable] stores with distribution of ACE lack complete inventory of device and all product parts used. Our world class [Indecipherable] organization of over 1,600 employees has already started using their strong trade relationships to address these opportunities.

They engage with the nation's top 25 convenient store chains by [Indecipherable] e-vapor volume to improve visibility and inventory of NJOY in stores with existing distribution. It is because of their [Indecipherable] efforts that started this week, NJOY will begin to have its own retain presence through premium picture space and improved retail inventory only a few months after we completed the transaction. And later this month, we plan to broaden distribution base to a total of approximately 43,000 stores, a 25% increase since we completed the transaction. We expect to further expand distribution to a total of 70,000 stores by the end of this year, which represents approximately 7% in vapor volume and 55% of cigarette volume sold in the U.S. multioutlet and convenience channel.

This remarkable progress is a testament to the highly talented employees across the Altria family company and I applaud the hard work and collaboration. In oral tobacco, we are encouraged by the continued growth of [Indecipherable] products, which drove the estimated 2.5% increase in total U.S. oral tobacco volumes over the past six months. [Indecipherable] share points year over year and now represents 29.1% of the total U.S. oral tobacco category.

In the second quarter, on! reported ship volume increased nearly 50% versus the year ago period and while retail share of oral tobacco increased five-tenths sequentially, reaching [Indecipherable] share points in the second quarter. This represented a growth rate of almost 45% year over year and the 15th consecutive quarter of on! share growth.

Helix delivered the impressive results while growing on!'s retail price 17% versus the year ago period. We believe on!'s ability to continue to grow share while effectively reducing its commercial investments demonstrates the strength of its product portfolio and growing brand activity. Helix is focused on strategically investing behind the brand as the category grows and continues to expect profitability in 2025.

In September, our team's [Indecipherable] international path on! PLUS, our new tobacco derived nicotine wet pouch product that features an optimized long lasting flavor system and our proprietary soft feel material. The product will be available via e-commerce in Sweden, where our team's scientific [Indecipherable] that can form a future U.S. launch.

We're excited about on! PLUS and we believe consumers will be too. While a small sample size as early research indicates, about three out or four dippers and nicotine pouch consumers in our study preferred on! PLUS [Indecipherable] on a blind basis. We are on track to follow [Indecipherable] on! PLUS in the first half of next year.

We're [Indecipherable] tobacco business. In the second quarter, cigarette industry volume decline moderated. However, the consumer dynamic reaffirmed the past year largely continued. Elevated gas prices combined with the cumulative effect of higher inflation continued pressure consumer discretionary income allowances. However, we believe we have the appropriate tool to navigate this challenging environment. For example, team U.S.A. used RDM capabilities to deploy a series of strategic investments behind the marked Marlboro Black family of products earlier this year.

Using demand analytics, the team provided additional support for price-sensitive Marlboro smokers while being efficient with their commercial investments. As a result, Marlboro's second quarter of retail share of the cigarette category grew a tenth sequentially to 42.1%.

Let's now turn to California where a ban on the sale of flavor-type products and tobacco product with flavor enhancers went into effect late last year. Our brands continued to perform well in the state. We remain concerned of the law enforcement and the negative unintended consequences of prohibitionary policies. We however continue [Indecipherable] in our first quarter remarks such as adulterated products, retailer and manufacturing noncompliance and illicit market activity. For example, roughly 65,000 OCB branded flavor cards were stolen in California in the first half of the year, more than triple the amount sold in the other 49 states combined. In comparison, OCB branded flavor card volume was [Indecipherable] in California in the year ago period when menthol cigarettes were still legally available.

To further understand consumer use of listed nicotine products, we commissioned a third-party study in California where researchers collected and analyzed nearly 20,000 discarded tobacco products. Their findings suggest that almost half of the cigarettes consumed were not tax stamped for sale in California and approximately 20% of the cigarette packs where menthol or products we believe other manufacturers recently introduced to sidestep the purpose of the law. In comparison, menthol represented approximately a quarter of the total California cigarette category prior to the ban's enactment.

And finally, while disposable e-vapor products were over represented in the study, 98% of the collective e-vapor products were flavored despite being subject to the California flavor ban and unauthorized by the FDA. These figures are alarming and indicate substantial illicit market activity. We believe the best way to prevent the listed markets is keep tobacco products legal and regulated. We have made this clear, and the public comments we submitted in response to the FDA's proposed menthol ban.

Our goal is for policymakers to embrace harm reduction as the proper framework for tobacco and nicotine product regulation. And there is a growing chorus of diverse stakeholders who agree, including consumers, our trade partners, public health advocates, criminal Justice reform advocates, law enforcement and tobacco growers. In fact, public opinion overwhelmingly supports harm reduction over prohibition. Insight shows a significant public health benefit of moving smokers away from combustible products for their smoke-free future.

We will continue to advocate for a well-regulated U.S. tobacco industry that embraces harm reduction. We have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on our results and the business environment."
"4","Sal Mancuso","Chief Financial Officer at Altria Group","Thanks, Billy. The smokeable products segment continue to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability and combustibles over the long term while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. The segment grew its adjusted operating company's income by 3.1% in the second quarter and by 1.7% in the first half. Adjusted OCI margins expanded to more than 60% for the second quarter and first half. This performance was supported by robust net price realization of 10.1% in the second quarter and 10.5% percent for the first half. At retail, Marlboro net pack price increased 6.1% in the second quarter compared to last year.

Smokeable products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.7% in the second quarter and 10% in the first half. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, second quarter and first half domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10% and 10.5% respectively. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 7.5% in the second quarter and by 8% in the first half.

At retail, the total discounts segment share grew 1.8 percentage points year-over-year to 28.2%, but was flat sequentially. We believe some smokers are trading down as a result of the adverse financial conditions that Billy described. We also continue to see increased competitive activity in the discount segment including multiple branded discount offerings priced at deep discount levels.

As Billy mentioned, Marlboro displayed resiliency during a period of economic pressure for consumers. In the second quarter, Marlboro's retail share of the cigarette category grew a tenth sequentially to 42.1%, while declining six-tenths versus the year-ago period, partially driven by the discount dynamics that I've described. We have also seen a decline in Marlboro's menthol share of the total category as a result of the California flavor ban and increased competitive activity from premium menthol brands in the balance of the country.

Additionally, Marlboro grew its share within the premium segment to 58.6%, an increase of one-tenth sequentially and five-tenths year-over-year, while other brands ceded share in this segment over the past year. We believe Marlboro's performance over the long term is a testament to its positioning within the premium segment as the aspirational brand with strong consumer loyalty.

In cigars, reported cigar shipment volume increased 5% in the first half. To continue this momentum, the Middleton team is expanding Royale, which will further enhance Black & Mild's active tip offerings. The team expects Black & Mild Royale to be available nationally later this month.

Moving to the oral tobacco products segment, second quarter adjusted OCI grew 3% and this segment expanded adjusted OCI margins to 68%. This performance was supported by robust net price realization, due in-part to more efficient on-promotional investments. In the first half, the segment grew adjusted OCI by 2.6% with strong adjusted OCI margins of 68.7%. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased by 1.7% and 1.8% for the second quarter and the first half respectively. The segment's volume decline was driven by declines in MST volumes, partially offset by the growth of on!.

When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, segment volume declined by an estimated 2.5% for both the second quarter and first half. Oral tobacco products segment retail share declined 2.8 percentage points in the second quarter as declines in our MST brands were partially offset by the continued growth of on!.

We continue to be encouraged by the performance of our oral tobacco products as on! continue to grow share in a competitive category and Copenhagen remained the category leader.

Moving to our investment in ABI, we recorded $132 million of adjusted equity earnings in the second quarter This was an increase of approximately 6.5% from the year-ago period and represents Altria's share of ABI's first quarter 2023 results. Our balance sheet remained strong and as of the end of the second-quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2 times. In July, we received the remaining $1.7 billion, plus interest from Philip Morris International as a part of the IQOS agreement we announced last fall.

After receiving the payment, we repaid the term loan we entered to finance the NJOY transaction. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our focus on significant capital returns and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We demonstrated this commitment in the first half by completing our acquisition of NJOY, retiring approximately $1.6 billion in long-term notes at maturity with available cash, paying approximately $3.4 billion in dividends and repurchasing 10.4 million shares, totaling $472 million. At the end of June, we had $528 million remaining under the currently authorized $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year.

With that, we'll wrap up and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. Let's open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?"
"5","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Just quickly, before we turn it over to the to the Q&A, I just want to apologize to those of you on the webcast for some audio issues we had early on in the call. So we will work to expedite the posting of our replay, so you'll have full access to the remarks. So with that, we'll turn to Q&A."
"6","Operator",NA,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. We'll take our first question from Pam Kaufman with Morgan Stanley."
"7","Pamela Kaufman","Analyst at Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning."
"8","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Good morning."
"9","Pamela Kaufman","Analyst at Morgan Stanley","How do you think about the long-term industry volume outlook for the cigarette category? Cigarette industry volumes were down 8% in the first half of this year. Do you expect industry volumes will return to the mid single-digit decline rate? And what would need to happen for them to normalize towards that level?"
"10","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yeah, thanks for the question. Pamela. I think when you think about it and we discussed this a little bit in the first quarter, but I think it's worth a reminder. Remember in the COVID pandemic, we actually saw what we believe added nicotine occasions for adult smokers day. As we came out of the COVID pandemic and you saw mobility increase, you would expect some of those nicotine occasions to come back out of their day and I think that was exacerbated by the cumulative effect of inflation. So we had nicotine occasions coming back out of their day and exacerbated by cumulative inflation.

So when you think about it. I think it's best to go back in history a bit and look at similar occurrences where the adult tobacco consumer was under extreme economic pressure, and you can look at '08, '09 and you see similar occurrences there. What we see with the adult cigarette consumers, it takes a bit of time for them to adjust to their new situation and you see typically and we saw it in '08, '09 '01, '02, the consumer returns to their basic normal nicotine occasions in the day. So I think what we're seeing right now, even though inflation is coming down on a cumulative basis, it's still growing. So the consumer is still under economic pressure.

You recall that in the first quarter, we put some extra investments behind a couple of pockets of areas where we saw a competitor to get aggressive with menthol offerings and where we saw the consumer under pressure and looking for discount, and you see, we're extremely pleased with the results of those investments as Marlboro picked up a tenth quarter over quarter."
"11","Pamela Kaufman","Analyst at Morgan Stanley","That's helpful. And in your prepared remarks, you touched on some of the initiatives that you have to drive NJOY growth. Now that you've owned the business for two months, can you just elaborate on where you see opportunity to operate the brand more efficiently and how are you thinking about the contribution from NJOY over the coming quarters and the level of investment that you'll need to make behind the brand?"
"12","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yeah, thanks for the question. You're right. There was a month in the results for the quarter and now we've surpassed another month. Our focus will be on the pod-based product, the ACE NJOY and you heard in my remarks filling distribution gaps as well as visibility. Just to characterize that, only 3,000 stores currently in distribution through all top three based ACE-pod SKUs and about 10,000 stores carry the pods, but no devices. So, the focus will be both on filling those distribution gaps and improving visibility, while at the same time enhancing ACE's brand equity to increase both brand awareness and appeal amongst adult smokers and vapors."
"13","Pamela Kaufman","Analyst at Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you."
"14","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Thank you."
"15","Operator",NA,"And we'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs."
"16","Bonnie Herzog","Analyst at The Goldman Sachs Group","All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone."
"17","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Good morning, Bonnie."
"18","Bonnie Herzog","Analyst at The Goldman Sachs Group","I had a question on your guidance. You reaffirmed your EPS growth guidance of 1% to 4% this year, which remain pretty darn wide, especially given only five months left this year. So, I guess I'm trying to understand this and what headwinds do you see that would cause you to come in at the lower end of your guidance, which implies negative low single-digit EPS growth in the second half?"
"19","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Most certainly we highlighted for you, Bonnie, that we'll be investing behind the NJOY brand as we expand distribution and have equity spending. I think the other thing is, look, the economy is very dynamic right now and we've highlighted for you that the adult cigarette consumer is under extreme pressures and we want the flexibility to adapt to them and be there for consumers if necessary. So, I think we'll see how the economy progresses and we'll see how the adult cigarette consumer returns to, if you will, more of a comfortable position from an economic standpoint."
"20","Bonnie Herzog","Analyst at The Goldman Sachs Group","Okay. I guess that makes sense. I mean you have flexibility with some of your investments. So I'm curious, Billy, can you give us a sense of how much you expect your investments to step up this year versus last year?"
"21","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yeah. I won't go into details just for competitive reasons, but certainly will be, as I mentioned, really enhancing the brand equity to increase awareness amongst both adult vapors and adult cigarette consumers and then we'll be looking for distribution, so both filling distribution gaps as well as improving the visibility of ACE in stores where it's currently distributed and then expanding to new stores."
"22","Bonnie Herzog","Analyst at The Goldman Sachs Group","Okay and then just maybe one final question from me, just on the relative price gaps, which continue to widen. I guess it's now the wider it's been for maybe 15 years. I know I've asked you this before, but given it keeps widening, I guess I'd like to hear how your strategy might be changing, given the call that you just mentioned on the consumer and then what the deep discount manufacturers are doing? Just curious to hear how flexible you might be with your pricing, promo strategy and then certainly your strategy behind leveraging Marlboro Black to potentially minimize downtrading? Thans, Billy."
"23","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yeah, thanks, and I'll be careful to not talk about future pricing, but I think you can see, like, going from first quarter to second quarter, we highlighted for you some areas of where we thought additional investment was necessary. And you saw the significant result of those. Marlboro increasing a tenth sequentially.

So we want that flexibility, but I would remind you that the RDM tools, so that price gap that you're seeing is on a national basis and the RDM tools that we have in the advanced analytics allows us to monitor that price got down to a very, very low level and we can be efficient with spend and even move spend around if necessary around the U.S. So that's how we're thinking about it.

From a standpoint of Marlboro itself, you see it continues to grow in the premium segment. It's performing very well and, as I highlighted for Pamela, we've seen instances this in history of when the consumer is under pressure that you see discount grow, you see premium from a total industry perspective. And then you see that moderate through time."
"24","Bonnie Herzog","Analyst at The Goldman Sachs Group","Thank you."
"25","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Thank you."
"26","Operator",NA,"And we'll take our next question from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen."
"27","Vivien Azer","Analyst at TD Cowen","Good morning."
"28","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Good morning."
"29","Vivien Azer","Analyst at TD Cowen","So, I want to start on your oral tobacco margins please. Quite nice to see some year-over-year improvement given kind of the multiyear degradation we've seen in support of on!. So, I was wondering, can you just comment on how we should think about margins for oral tobacco in the back half? Thanks."
"30","Sal Mancuso","Chief Financial Officer at Altria Group","Yeah. I am going to be careful not to talk about future quarters. I will agree with you, we're really happy with the margin performance in the OTP segment for year-to-date OTP margins. As I said in my remarks, we're over 68%. What you're seeing I think is the success of on! where we've grown share each quarter and as we talked about in our early remarks, you see Increased pricing of 17% on a year-over-year basis. So. I think that shows the strength of on! in the marketplace. But we're really excited about the progress on! is making and the overall OTP performance."
"31","Vivien Azer","Analyst at TD Cowen","Certainly. Thank you for that. And then for my follow-up question. Billy, nice to see the Marlboro market share be up sequentially despite some of the heightened competitive activity that you called out from competitive premium menthol offerings. Just given kind of the competitive backdrop, do you think that you need to have the Marlboro Black Gold in the marketplace longer than you'd originally contemplated?"
"32","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Look, we think that's an addition to our portfolio. It certainly gives the Marlboro team, it rounds out the Black portfolio. The Marvel Black, the family has been around a while. We saw this as a gap in that portfolio and we filled that. So from a standpoint of overall Marlboro Black, you can think about that as about 10% of Marlboro and it certainly gives the consumer a safe place or a place to land if they're under economic pressure. And as you've seen previously when we use tools like this, we're able to shrink the gap to mainline through time.

So it's about keeping mainline very strong, which we're very pleased that it is and then having a place for the Marlboro consumer because Marlboro is still the aspirational brand in the cigarette category. Having a place for them to land when they're under economic pressure and as the situation changes, we can trend back after mainline."
"33","Vivien Azer","Analyst at TD Cowen","Certainly. Thank you so much for that."
"34","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Thank you."
"35","Operator",NA,"And we'll take our next question from Matt Smith with Stifel."
"36","Matt Smith","Analyst at Stifel Financial","Hi, good morning."
"37","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Good morning, Matt."
"38","Matt Smith","Analyst at Stifel Financial","Billy. I just I wanted to follow up on your commentary about the level of investment in the cigarette business and are we an environment now with the enhanced digital tools and more efficient ways to engage with your consumers that you expect more volume to be sold using promotional activity, even as economic conditions improve?"
"39","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yes. I wouldn't think of it as more volume under promotional. I think it's being more efficient and effective with that promotional spend. It's trying to get it to the individual consumer as close as we can get to that that needs it, while not subsidizing adult cigarette consumers that don't need it. And I think you've seen that with both the growth of Marlboro in the premium space, the investments we made first to second. It's had the 10th sequentially bump and the price realization we are experiencing in the cigarette space."
"40","Matt Smith","Analyst at Stifel Financial","Okay, thank you for that and if I could ask another question on the growth on the on! oral brand. The growth there remains robust even as you've reduced promotional activity. Can you remind us where the brand stands today in terms of distribution and how we should think about the drivers of growth for on! in the second half of the year?"
"41","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yeah. I think from a distribution, we got it in the stores and while you may see small fluctuations as we decide if we want to add additional stores and distribution, but we've got it to where we want it. You recall we were capacity constrained from a manufacturing basis, we're beyond that. It continues to grow. I would say the growth as we move forward, as it continues, even though we've been talking about it and you guys have been talking about it for a while, it's still fairly new to the consumer. So it is continuing to drive awareness and specifically trial once the consumer trials it, they enjoy the product. So that's where the growth will come, is the success in achieving new consumers to the category as they transition.

I think when you think about that transition through time, it's important to remember that you're looking at the consumer specifically dippers that are moving currently in large amounts, but it's also talking to the cigarette consumer and it allows oral tobacco product to be available to consumers that previously rejected moist smokeless tobacco."
"42","Matt Smith","Analyst at Stifel Financial","Thank you for that, Billy. I'll pass it on."
"43","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Thank you."
"44","Operator",NA,"We'll take our next question from Andrei Condrea with UBS."
"45","Andrei Condrea","Analyst at UBS Group","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Two from me, please, if you don't mind. Firstly, when looking at the U.S. cigarette industry, we saw that discount was stable on a sequential basis bucking the trend from the past three years to four years. How much of that do you think could be attribute it to your Marlboro Black Gold, for instance, and just increased promo activity from you and peers? Thank you."
"46","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yeah. I don't know about what it specifically attributed to increased promo, as we've highlighted for you that the adult cigarette consumer in the U.S. is really under economic pressure and so you look there's certainly give them places to land, specifically in Marlboro, a place the land where they can continue to engage with Marlboro. We see that as both less expensive versus them leaving and returning and we've been successful at that in the past and I think you see the results first to second quarter."
"47","Andrei Condrea","Analyst at UBS Group","Makes sense. Thank you. And secondly, this a bit more medium term. But as you're pushing harder into vaping now with NJOY, Illicit products are a problem on the market as flagged by one of your peers. What can you and said peer do more to basically improve enforcement in the area and get those numbers down?"
"48","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yeah. I think it's continued engagement both with Congress and as well as the FDA to really make this their top priority. You saw under age use of e-vapor come down, but it's essential that the FDA really focused on enforcement. It's illicit product in the marketplace with flavors that are not authorized. And so you saw in the most recent National Youth Tobacco Survey, the most popular [Indecipherable] with youth following wasn't a listed product in the marketplace.

Now, they have started stepping up enforcement. But it needs to be more vigorous in the marketplace. Even if they were just published a list of those products that are authorized and those that are under review, it would certainly level set with the trade, because the enforcement that they're doing while encouraging isn't enough to change what the marketplace -- is what we're experiencing in the marketplace."
"49","Andrei Condrea","Analyst at UBS Group","Very clear. Thank you. I'll pass it on."
"50","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Thank you."
"51","Operator",NA,"[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays."
"52","Gaurav Jain","Analyst at Barclays","Hi, good morning, Billy. Good morning, Sal."
"53","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Good morning."
"54","Gaurav Jain","Analyst at Barclays","Hi, a couple of questions from me. So one is on the e-cigarette industry growth, clearly disposables are cannibalizing [Indecipherable] e-cigarettes. So why are you launching the NJOY ACE and not the NJOY DAILY product? In that context, can you also just tell us where you are with the PMTA application of the NextGen product which is -- which you have mentioned you have filed?"
"55","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Yes, so let's break that down. So the first part. I think if you think about the e-vapor category. Certainly, there is a large pod base of consumers and so we certainly see that as an opportunity and you heard in the remarks, the NJOT ACE is the only pod that has received FDA authorization. When you think about the disposable side, the growth, at least what we're seeing in the marketplace is with the plethora of flavors that are illicitly in the marketplace.

So as the FDA certainly steps up enforcement and we see enforcement take place and those illicit products come out of the marketplace, we see the potential again because NJOY was able to receive authorization for their disposable, the opportunity for growth in that space, but we feel like that the appropriate focus is on that large pod based consumer base and until the illicit plethora of flavors and its flavors that are illicitly in the marketplace are cleaned up.

From a standpoint of the age restriction, I think you were referring to, we just recently closed it and we're excited about that technology. We're assessing the timing of following that. We would have a target in mind by the end of this year. But I think what's so exciting about it is it the regulatory team that we certainly welcome on board from the NJOY that successfully navigated. it's the only pod-based product that has navigated the regulatory. So we're excited, they had started the application and again we would target following that by the end of the year."
"56","Gaurav Jain","Analyst at Barclays","Sure, thank you. And can you also update us on this June patent litigation that they have filed against NJOY, which I found very surprising considering I thought you would have -- when you walked away from JUUL, you would have gained access to all their IP. So could you just help us understand what's happening there?"
"57","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Sure. We believe that the litigation against this is meritless and we are vigorously looking to respond to that. When you step back from it, we think it's interesting that JUUL only brought the suit after we completed the acquisition. The litigation, if you think about it from a standpoint of the merits of it, it really feels like a bit of an act of desperation, if you will, to stifle competition really from the only pod-based product that the FDA has determined appropriate for the protection of public health. So we see it as meritless."

"59","Billy Gifford","Chief Executive Officer at Altria Group","Our focus currently is as we've mentioned filling the distribution gaps on existing stores in the U.S., expanding distribution to approximately 70,000 stores by the end of this year and we'll come back to you on an international plans when it's appropriate."
