"3","Chris Forsythe","Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Atmos Energy","Thank you, Dan, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we announced fiscal year-to-date, diluted earnings per share of $5.33 compared to $5.12 per diluted share in the prior year period. Our third-quarter and fiscal year-to-date financial results were in line with our expectations and continued to be driven by three key themes; regulatory outcomes reflecting increased safety and reliability spending, continued strong customer growth, and higher O&M spending.

Fiscal '22 and '23 regulatory outcomes in both of our segments increased operating income by approximately $204 million and higher consumption residential customer growth, enlighting[phonetic] industrial load in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $27 million. These increases were partially offset by $70 million increase in consolidated O&M. Year-to-date distribution O&M increased $48 million or 12.6%. However, during the third fiscal quarter, the rate of O&M increase in this segment moderated somewhat as O&M increasing approximately 3.5% quarter over quarter.

The higher level of O&M spending continues to be largely driven by higher levels of service orders to support our growing service territory, primarily in Texas. Fiscal year-to-date, we experienced an 8% increase in the number of line located in Texas, and we continue to see higher labor costs release third-party services. Additionally, service orders increased 10%, largely driven by customer growth and increasing customer collection activities. The remaining $23 million of fiscal year to date increase in consolidated O&M incurred in our pipeline and storage segment, primarily driven by the timing of in-line inspection work for this segment.

In the prior fiscal year most of that work was concentrated in the fourth-quarter. In this fiscal year this work was incurred more ratably throughout the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending increased 21% or $358 million to $2.1 billion with 86% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects higher spending of APT or allowing us to in-line PC projects designed to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility, and supply diversification of our system. Depending[phonetic] our distribution segment has increased due to higher safety line reliability spending and higher spending to support customer growth.

During our third fiscal quarter, we implemented $122 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. Year-to-date, we have now completed $263 million of annualized regulatory outcomes. We currently have an additional $263 million in annualized outcomes and progress, including $107 million related to our APT general rate case that we filed in May of this year. We currently expect to finalize that case in December of 2023. Our financial position continues to remain strong. We finished our third fiscal quarter with an equity capitalization of 61.8% and approximately $3.1 billion of liquidity. This amount includes $590 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '23 equity needs and a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 needs.

Additionally, during our third fiscal quarter, we completed our $95 million securitization process in Kansas and began including securitization charge on customer bills effective July first. As I previously mentioned, our third-quarter and fiscal year to date results were in line for expectations, which gives us the confidence to reaffirm our fiscal '23 guidance in the range of $6 to $6.10. Additionally, we now expect capital spending to approximately $2.8 billion, largely reflecting higher spending persistent expansion of distribution segment. Thank you for your time today and I will turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin?"
"4","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","Thank you, Chris, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fiscal year performance reflects the continued dedication of our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees in executing our proven safety and reliability investment strategy. Through their commitment, focus, and effort we are modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage systems, while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers in 1400 community across our eight states. We continue to experience strong customer growth, driven by robust employment trends particularly in Texas.

For the 12 months ended June 30th, we added nearly 64,000 new customers, with just over 48,000 of those new customers located here in Texas and according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment for the 12 months ended May 31st the number of employees reached a new record-high at nearly 14.4 million, leading the country and number and percentage of jobs added. Additionally, according to a study by Site Selection Group, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is projected to add one million people by 2022, to reach nearly 8.5 million people here in the Metroplex.

Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territories also remained strong. During the third quarter, we added 10 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately eight Bcf once they are fully operational. Fiscal year-to-date, we've added 41 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 16 Bcf, once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis that 16 Bcf of anticipated load is equivalent to adding nearly 294,000 residential customers.

Finally, we continued our outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers. During the first nine months of the fiscal year our customer advocacy team and customer support agents helped over 55,000 customers receive about $23 million in funding assistance. Our continued focus on long-term sustainability combined with executing our proven investment, regulatory, and financing strategy has us positioned well for another successful year in fiscal 2023 and reflects the vital role we play in every community providing safe, reliable, and efficient natural gas service to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.

We appreciate your time this morning and we'll now open the call to questions."
"5","Operator",NA,"[Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Richard, please go ahead."
"6","Richard Sunderland","Analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove","Hi, good morning, can you hear me?"
"7","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","Yes, good morning go ahead."
"8","Richard Sunderland","Analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove","Great, thank you. Starting with the O&M trends, can you speak to year-to-date trends relative to the implied 4Q outlook here. There's certainly a pretty stark reversal kind of embedded in the numbers. I know you referenced inspection work, but just curious if there are other timing factors at play also if you've done work to derisk '24 and that's part of the outlook for the balance of the year as well."
"9","Chris Forsythe","Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Atmos Energy","Yeah, thank you, Rich. We'll start with '23. Again a lot of the timing is related to the APT in-line inspection work that I referenced just a couple of minutes ago and again, more of that -- more of that work was ratable this year in the first half in the the fiscal year primarily compared to last year it was more concentrated in the fourth quarter as we look forward into fiscal '24, we're still [indecipherable] five year plan, but we are looking for opportunities to derisk that a little bit in terms of particularly in the distribution side, looking at how we might approach line locate strategy there as well as just trying to lock in some of the longer-term contracts and some of our service contracts that are third party by design and so those are some things that we're looking at to try to mitigate some increases going forward."
"10","Richard Sunderland","Analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove","Got it, very helpful color there. And then shifting to the APT rate case curious on any early thoughts on stakeholder engagement, what you're hearing locally. What is the timing for settlement discussions just procedurally in that case, and any expectations around your ability to reach settlement."
"11","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","Yeah Richard, this is Kevin. I'll start out, we're right on pace with the procedural schedule as it's outlined there. We're still continuing to get data requests, we're responding to those. So at this point, if you look at the procedural schedule we feel like we're on-track to get an order sometime towards the end-of-the calendar year in that December timeframe."
"12","Richard Sunderland","Analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove","And then just high-level thoughts on ability to reach a settlement here, is that something that's embedded in the plan and anything you could say on that front would be helpful."
"13","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","No, again, we're still continuing to answer questions at this point, we'll see how we progress over the next few weeks or so. But at this point, again I think we're on track with the outline procedure schedule."
"14","Richard Sunderland","Analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove","Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you for the time today."
"15","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","Thank you."
"16","Chris Forsythe","Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Atmos Energy","Thank you."
"17","Operator",NA,"[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan, please go ahead."
"18","Ryan Levine","Analyst at Citi Group","Hi, everybody. Just a couple of O&M. Appreciate the comments already made, but on a go-forward basis, should we be expecting the seasonality of operating costs to be more late this year or prior years and kind of what's driving some of the change in cadence."
"19","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","Ryan, I think as you think about on a go forward we certainly had anticipated going into '23, some of the inflationary costs. We knew we were going to have some growth, but if you look at the O&M was driven on a line locating as Chris mentioned before. I would certainly anticipate that to continue, but I think we've got a good outlook on that now on where we stand on number of locates, type of other O&M expenses, as Chris said, as we move to finalize our '24 plan, and look forward from there."
"20","Chris Forsythe","Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Atmos Energy","Yeah, the other thing too Ryan I'll add is that a lot of this timing is just based upon the availability of the contractors who did the works as Kevin talked about a little bit with the APT work last year we did a lot of work in the fourth quarter because the contractors are on site, they're working with us, we decided to go ahead and move into the first and second quarter, since they were already engaged with us rather than releasing them and have them come back six months later. So we also have to just work around the needs of the system, the timing of the system, it depends on what we might [technical issue] construction work on certain segments of the system, which can influence the timing.

I've also referenced, service orders, a lot of those are difficult to forecast but in service orders generally related to particularly this last year, more calling into the customer contact center because of high bill given the higher prices we experienced back in the winter heating season, difficult to predict if that will reoccur in the first or second quarter, as well as just some of our disconnection activities. That's why we managed to a full-fiscal year in terms of guidance, because some of those operating conditions are difficult to predict and we're just responding to the needs of the business with an eye towards accomplishing our fiscal year earnings per share targets."
"21","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","Yeah. I think that's the other point Ryan here as our communities, as you've heard us say, are growing and expanding now where we're working with them on timing of their projects, whether their infrastructure projects are occurring, water sewer, the fiber-optic projects out there, you've got low relocations, new road construction, that sort of thing going on. So some of this does cycle throughout the full-fiscal year period."
"22","Ryan Levine","Analyst at Citi Group","How much of this change in seasonality of costs was embedded in that response? It's really related to the spike in gas prices during this most recent winter as opposed to some of the other drivers that you highlighted."
"23","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","Yes, I don't know that I would make that kind of direct correlation. I think what Chris was alluding to was some orders for re-read that sort of thing based on bills, but I don't think it's -- it's a meaningful percentage of the rest of the overall operational O&M per se."
"24","Ryan Levine","Analyst at Citi Group","Okay. And then one I noticed in your -- in your guidance for the year you're pricing year end or at least your fiscal year end and the effective tax-rate this year was supposed to be higher than last year, is that from a longer-term planning perspective, anticipating that current effective tax-rate is appropriate for future time periods or any color you could share on how you're thinking about your tax position."
"25","Kevin Akers","President and Chief Executive Officer at Atmos Energy","Yeah, Ryan. The effective tax-rate that you see is roughly 11%, that's heavily influenced by the excess of -- the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities from the TCJA[phonetic] we're amortizing those over a three to five year period. So that's why we've included in our -- in our deck kind of the marginal effective tax-rate of roughly 22.5% to 23.5%, so that you have an idea of really what true tax impacts are, if you're modeling your O&M or other types of expenses of revenues, but we do anticipate the GAAP effective tax rate to increase as the excess deferred taxes wind down here over the next couple of years and revert back to that more traditional 22% to 23.5%."
"26","Ryan Levine","Analyst at Citi Group","Okay, great, thank you."
"27","Operator",NA,"[Operator Instructions] At this point, it does look like we are good on the questions. Dan, would you like me to turn it back over to you for closing remarks."
"28","Daniel Meziere","VP of IR & Treasurer at Atmos Energy","Sure. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. Recording of this call is available for replay on our website through September 30th. Have a great day. Thanks."
