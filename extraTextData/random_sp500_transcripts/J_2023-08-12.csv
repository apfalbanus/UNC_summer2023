"1","Operator",NA,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Brent, [Phonetic] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead."
"2","Jonathan Evans","Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you. Good morning.

Our earnings announcement [Technical Issue] 10-Q were filed this morning and we have posted a slide presentation on our website which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.

Turning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call, will be [Phonetic] Jacobs CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined by our incoming CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and summarizing highlights from our third-quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. And Claudia will provide an overview of separation-related activities. Finally. I will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks and then we'll open up the call for questions.

Before I hand it over to Bob, I want to address some reporting changes that were made in the quarter. We consistently [Technical Issue] review [Phonetic] our reporting practices to be aligned with best practices for our industry and SEC guidelines. After a review, we have decided to amend our naming convention or revenue excluding pass-through costs from net revenue to adjusted net revenue. Note, this is simply a name change intended to make the non-GAAP nature of this measure more prominent and does not impact measurement.

In addition, after an internal review, we have made certain minor adjustments to pass-through revenues in certain prior periods to properly reflect amounts that had not been previously included. As a result, in the materials that we have included in the appendix to this Presentation, we have adjusted People & Places adjusted net revenue for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Note, this change has been deemed as immaterial and has no impact on our reported earnings, operating income or cash flow.

With that, I will turn it over to Bob."
"3","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third-quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance.

Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to begin by recognizing the continued commitment and extraordinary talent of our 60,000-plus teammates here at Jacobs. I've now been in the CEO seat for over six months, and as I spend time with our clients and our people, I continue to be both inspired and appreciative of the dedication and world-class expertise they bring to some of the world's toughest challenges. Now more than ever, our communities require the brightest and best minds to step forward with innovative and technology-enabled solutions to drive better outcomes. I am proud of all that we do to play our part to enhance and serve those communities.

Firstly, I want to provide an update on our previously-announced intent to separate the CMS business before I move on to our third-quarter results. The company continues to make significant progress on the activities associated with the intended separation. In addition, following the announcement, there has been positive interest from multiple outside parties. We are currently evaluating this interest consistent with our commitment to maximize shareholder value. As previously communicated, a spin-off, which is subject to customary conditions, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2024. Let me reiterate: we are laser-focused on maximizing value for all [Technical Issue] stakeholders. As we progress towards the separation CMS, our teams continue to work tirelessly [Phonetic] and stand -- to stand up both companies for independent success. In the process, we have identified a number of operational enhancements that we believe will propel each company to greater heights in the future. Consequently, we believe that fiscal year 2024 will be a year of optimization and acceleration.

Turning to Slide 5. On optimization, we see significant potential to enhance our cost structure and our operating model to continue to drive efficiencies and lead our industry, not just in size but in profitability. This will unleash a more cohesive Jacobs that leverages our digital platforms, Consulting and Advisory, and global delivery model to accelerate our value-creating growth.

On acceleration, for many years, we have highlighted investments in growth, in our people, platforms and technology, and technology-enabled solutions. We've invested behind and probably manage a portfolio aligned with secular megatrends, critical infrastructure, water scarcity, sustainability, reshoring and energy transition. Our clients need us now more than ever and we are [Technical Issue] delivering. Jacobs is driving higher growth, higher margins, differentiated expertise and solutions. Our addressable market is growing and we are already capitalizing on these opportunities.

Turning to Slide 6 and Q3. I'm pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our growth is entirely organic and we continue to drive improving cash conversion, a hallmark of our business model, allowing us to invest behind our growth accelerators, climate response, Data Solutions and Consulting and Advisory.

Our People and Places line-of-business delivered accelerating topline growth with adjusted net revenue, up 9% year-over-year and operating profit up 13% year-over-year. Kevin will detail the significant growth we are experiencing in our global business units. We continue to see broad-based green shoots with a gross margin backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top line, which provides visibility and confidence in our expectations that growth will persist at current rates.

CMS remains a pillar of stability. CMS Q3 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year and operating [Technical Issue] profit increased 12% behind 36 bps of margin expansion. CMS continued to book awards at an over 70% win rate. Its pipeline and growth outlook remain robust with major award prospects in fiscal 2024 and minimal forecasted recompete pursuits. As a result, the Jacobs team is advancing required flight software and hardware testing called the Artemis II Mission, scheduled for December 2024; the second scheduled flight of the program, and notably, its first crewed mission.

In early July, an integrated team of NASA and Jacobs personnel at Marshall Space Center successfully completed the initial phase of formal qualification testing for the Artemis II SLS flight software. A very exciting time for all involved. PA Consulting sales and backlog once again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the Energy and Defense sectors. Margin stabilized in Q3 above 21%, supported by strategic cost actions taken during the quarter and we continue to have the highest confidence in our talented management team. PA continues to see increasing opportunities in energy transition. For example, we assisted a leading offshore wind developer in securing a fixed-price electricity contract in Ireland's first offshore wind auction. PA is also seeing significant interest in its digital expertise from clients who are looking to assess AI-related impacts and opportunities for their businesses. As an example, a leading cybersecurity client hard PA to support the development of a comprehensive, strategic plan with specific focus on understanding the power of AI in mitigating cyber threats.

Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 72% year-over-year growth in operating profit. During the quarter, we won another competitive pursuit with the Ohio Department of Transportation to extend StreetLight's software as a service offering. StreetLight already provides state-wide [Technical Issue] modeling [Phonetic] and traffic analysis, safety programing and support for large-scale planning efforts. This new contract is for congestion and freight management functionality to support the state's carbon emission reduction efforts.

Turning to Slide 7. Looking across the Jacobs Enterprise, we continue to see considerable and geographically diverse opportunities in our greater than $2 billion water business. From water reuse to treatment to drinking water, coupled with our innovative project delivery offering, demand remains robust. During Q3, we saw a healthy growth behind water scarcity-related pursuits. For example, scope increases in new wins with our long-standing partnership with the Singapore Public Utilities Board.

Under-investment and future-proofing needs -- also -- proofing needs also continued to be a major driver. In the US, we have been selected by a large Southern California utility and [Technical Issue] to provide program management and strategic funding advisory services to create a more sustainable, drop-resilient local water supply for one of the largest groundwater storage basins. [Phonetic] And in New Zealand, we were awarded an extension and expansion of our central interest [Technical Issue] program, the country's largest-ever wastewater project.

We also continue to see environmental and sustainability projects. For example, we amended a marquee [Phonetic] $450 million award from the US EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office and Region 5 Superfund to provide environmental, technical management services in associated infrastructure tasks in the Great Lakes area. We also see continuing momentum in legislation-aligned work. IIJA-aligned wins continue to accelerate versus the year-ago period and, for example, we were awarded the Brent Spence Bridge, an iconic connector of economic development between Ohio and Kentucky, which had been postponed for many years. And we continue to closely support the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority and their successful ""Low and No Emissions"" grant application. In subsequent -- subsequently, performed delivery services to provide energy-efficient buses and charging infrastructure.

Turning to Slide 8. In summary, we are extremely well-poised for the strong growth across sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record for operational excellence.

Now, I will turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail."
"4","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you, Bob.

And let me turn right to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our third-quarter results. Third-quarter gross revenue grew 9% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7.5%. Adjusted net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 25%, down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to PA Consulting. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks.

Adjusted G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 14.7%, [Phonetic] over 100 basis points better sequentially and year-over-year, more than offset -- offsetting the lower gross margin. Costs were [Phonetic] well managed due to discipline and actions taken and we are still targeting G&A [Technical Issue] as a percentage of adjusted net revenue to stay well below 16% for the full-fiscal year 2023, improving upon the 16.2% figure realized in 2022.

GAAP operating profit was $270 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, other transaction and separation-related costs on restructuring efforts of $38 million and a $1.4 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy. The other transaction separation-related and restructuring costs, a $38 million included three distinct types of costs: the first represents approximately 45% of the $38 million and relates to the restructuring initiative in our PA Consulting business to rightsize the cost structure to align with the company's end-market demands. The second cost represents approximately 35% of the amount and is associated with our initial advisory and other costs associated with the separation of the CMS. Third bucket, which is approximately 20% of the $34 million, is related to the costs of noncash PA contingent equity-based agreements associated with the PA transaction structure [Phonetic] and other miscellaneous incentive costs that were considered part of the total consideration of previous transactions. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $361 million, up over 10% year-over-year.

Our total discrete items for the year excluding the new CMS separation efforts will remain at the $100 million figures that we have forecasted for the year, well below the total figure of $185 million in 2022. Of this $100 million figure, the total noncash impairment costs will total approximately $45 million. Such impairments will be largely complete as we exit this fiscal year. Of course, as we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS. I would like Claudia to provide more detail in her prepared remarks.

Our adjusted operating profit to adjusted net revenue was 10.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, $0.20 from transaction restructuring and other related costs, a $0.01 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint and a $0.05 adjustment to align to our projected annual adjusted tax rate.

Excluding these items, third-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.82, down 2% year-over-year. Importantly, while down versus the year-ago period, 2022 benefited from the $0.08 cost investment gain associated with the sale of our WatchGuard investment. In addition, in 2023, incremental interest costs of $0.07 have reduced EPS this quarter versus the year-ago figure. The net impact is a $0.15 headwind in EPS year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full-year forecast, with Bob providing an overview of our guidance range at the end of our cost -- call, we expect Q4 EPS to show healthy growth versus the year-ago period.

Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $355 million and was down 2% year-over-year, representing 10.5% of adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 3% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was at 1 times with our gross margin in backlog, again, improving year-over-year.

Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10, for Q3. People & Places Solutions continues to see solid momentum, delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 9% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units, led by Advanced Facilities. Europe continues to see some pressure but was more than offset by strength in the Middle East, Americas and Asia Pacific. Backlog was flat year-over-year, although gross margins [Technical Issue] in the [Phonetic] backlog was up 8% as we continue to focus on improving the quality of work bid and won [Phonetic].

Q3 operating profit was up 13% and 15% in constant currency, driven by strong growth leverage and solid G&A management, resulting in operating profit as a percentage of adjusted net revenue of 14.4%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. We expect year-over-year improvement and strong People & Places operating profit margin and growth to continue in Q4.

Our Advanced Facilities unit, which represents approximately one-fourth of our People & Places growth's revenue and benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains, posted a sixth consecutive of quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite macroeconomic cross currents, our Tier 1 customers continue to pursue robust spending plans underpinned by long-term demand drivers. The backlog in sales pipeline remains healthy and we continue to be encouraged about the outlook for the segment.

Our People & Places Americas unit reported Q3 operating profits with 10%-plus growth as legislation-driven backlog begins to convert at higher rates. For example, IIJA-related profit is trending nearly 20% ahead of our [Technical Issue] plan. We remain enthusiastic about our overall growth opportunities with double-digit pipeline growth led by water, Cities and Places, and Energy and Power.

Our Q3 International business revenue and operating profit were up high single-digits year-over-year as Asia Pacific and the Middle East continue to be a bright spot in the portfolio, supported by gigacities and strategic water pursuits.

Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Q3 revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. CMS has benefited from an over 70% win rate year-to-date, and as a result, backlog is up 12% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains very healthy as our CMS [Phonetic] positions for strategic growth in its core focus areas of Space, Defense, Energy and Technology Solutions. CMS operating profit and OP margins were both up sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our previous guidance, with operating profit up 12% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating margins to approximately 8% on a full-year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher-margin opportunities.

Moving to Divergent Solutions. Adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year as we remain focused on higher-margin contracts. This trend should be expected to continue near term before an acceleration in coming quarters as our investments in sales and technology offerings bear fruit. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 9.5%, a sequential improvement as compared to Q2's underlying normalized margin when adjusting for the benefit of a large license sale in the prior quarter. We have increasing confidence that the underlying margin momentum over the past two quarters is durable, and as a result, we continue to expect Divergent's quarterly margins [Phonetic] to approach 10% in Q4.

Turning to PA Consulting. Revenues from PA was up 3% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times, an indication of the company's relative performance to peers driven by their value to clients in a tough economic environment. PA's Q3 operating profit margin was 21.2%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and up over 15% year-over-year. PA Management continues to take action to improve utilization and we expect OP margins to be 20%-plus for the medium-term with potential for longer-term improvement.

Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $62 million in Q3, consistent with our guidance. We expect that our quarterly run rate may remain elevated at or above the recent level for a short period of time. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under our more streamlined business model focused on Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities. Claudia will provide her perspective in her prepared remarks.

Turning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings despite temporary restructuring and separation-related efforts. Free cash flow was $290 million, resulting in a year-to-date 127% conversion of net income into free cash flow. As a result, we are well-positioned to deliver at or above our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year.

Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in shares at an average price of $115. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.2 billion, resulting in just over $2.1 billion of net debt. Our Q3 net debt to 2023 [Phonetic] expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5 times remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile both [Phonetic] today and as a more focused business post our announced CMS separation.

As of the end of Q3, approximately 56% of our debt is tied to a floating rate debt and our weighted average interest rate was 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which increased 13% year-over-year and will be paid on August 25.

Before I formally transition [Phonetic] the CFO role to Claudia on August 14, I wanted to say a few words on my last earnings call. It has been an honor working with such talented colleagues and witnessing our collective accomplishments over the past eight-and-a-half years. During my tenure, I've observed tremendous growth and transformation within our company, and I am immensely proud of the achievements we have made together. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the Board, Leadership team, and dedicated employees for their unwavering support, passion and commitment to excellence. For our investors, your trust has been instrumental in our success. While my time as CFO comes to an end, I remain confident in the company's bright future and have no doubt that the company is in good hands with Claudia in the CFO role. I also look forward to supporting Bob in my new role as his Special Advisor going forward.

I will now turn the call over to Claudia."
"5","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you, Kevin.

Turning to Slide 11 -- sorry, Slide 12. I have now been with Jacobs for just over one year and look forward to formally succeeding Kevin next week. He has been a superb partner throughout this transition period and I feel privileged to help lead this company at such an important inflection point in its storied history. As EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development, I've always seen the rollout of our strategic standard management office at the center of the CMS separation. Our goal is to continue to serve our clients without interruption, optimize both companies operating models, and to effectively manage risk associated with the separation.

Due to the hard and tireless work of our teams, we have made significant progress towards effective day-one readiness. We can also confidently reinforce that we intend to eliminate separation-related stranded costs. In addition, we have identified value levers that we believe can lead to continued productivity gains at Independent Jacobs. Last quarter, we outlined Independent Jacobs target operating profit margins of 12% from separation alone. Yet, we believe there is further upside and it is our goal to further expand margins post-separation.

We'll have more to say about that over time but one of the most exciting aspects of the separation is the opportunity to drive further growth and profitability with a streamlined Jacobs. Jacobs has recognized sustainable business model with a strong foundation that aligns purpose with both growth and value creation. I, like the rest of the Jacobs team, am absolutely committed to Jacobs's purpose-led vision. Our vision underpins our commitment to deliver superior results for our shareholders, employees and broader stakeholders. I look forward to meeting more of our employees, clients and investors in the weeks and months to come as I assume the CFO position.

Thank you and I will turn the call over to Bob."
"6","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you, Claudia.

Turning to Slide 13. Due to the strong year-to-date performance and forward indicators, we reiterate our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion, and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45. We will provide guidance for fiscal year 2024 in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release.

Turning to Slide 14. In closing, I would like to express my tremendous appreciation for Kevin's contribution to the transformational success of our company over the last eight-plus years. Kevin is a great personal friend and has been a fantastic business partner. I am privileged to have his continued support as my Special Advisor.

We are very fortunate to have Claudia as a critical leader on our team. I look forward to her continued accomplishments and contributions, building on her success to date.

Operator, we will now open the call for questions."
"7","Operator",NA,"[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open."
"8","Michael Dudas","Analyst at Vertical Research","Good morning, Claudia, Jonathan, Bob, and well done, Kevin."
"9","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","Morning."
"10","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Morning."
"11","Jonathan Evans","Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations at Jacobs Solutions","Morning."
"12","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you."
"13","Michael Dudas","Analyst at Vertical Research","Bob, encouraged about the continued backlog margin improvement. If you could share a little bit about where that margin improvement this quarter is coming from, and as you look at the pipeline and some of the recent bookings, how that may play through as we move into 2024 and the mix given the -- either the three bigs of the [Indecipherable] you want to include a CMS on that margin improvement expectation for 2024?"
"14","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah. Mike, thanks.

I'd say right now, the margin improvement is coming from a couple of key drivers. First is around the mix. We are finding a larger part of our portfolio in the Consulting Advisory component. And when I say that I'm not saying exclusively PA, that's across the board even on our infrastructure engagements right now, we're hitting jobs right at the front end where we've kind of got a higher-end, higher-margin consultative service component. So mix is definitely a driver.

The second component on current margin expansion is around, say, the operational discipline that we've been working on for quite a while. And so, our project delivery, as well as the stability in our offering, has continued to evolve. Moving forward, as far as the continued expansion, the digital enablement is starting to come through, you can't quite see it just yet, but it's becoming a larger part of our portfolio. And this is broad -- this broad across the enterprise.

And then, the global delivery model. We've been talking about that for several quarters but that global delivery model is paying some real fruit, and we see that continuing to rise moving forward."
"15","Michael Dudas","Analyst at Vertical Research","Thank you, Bob."
"16","Operator",NA,"Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open."
"17","Andy Kaplowitz","Analyst at Smith Barney Citigroup","Good morning, everyone. Kevin, thanks for all your help."
"18","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you, Andy."
"19","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","Morning."
"20","Jonathan Evans","Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations at Jacobs Solutions","Morning"
"21","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Hey, Andy."
"22","Andy Kaplowitz","Analyst at Smith Barney Citigroup","So you guys mentioned that you had interested parties looking at CMS. To the extent you can, can you give us any more color regarding the interest? Is it from PE firms and strategics? What's the timeframe for when you might make a decision regarding a potential sale? And could you give us any more detail when you think about CMS' tax basis and how you consider that tax leakage versus a potential spin?"
"23","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah, Andy, unfortunately, we can't. That's right now -- just mentioned that the interest is strong. We're evaluating and we can't go into any more detail than that. I apologize."
"24","Andy Kaplowitz","Analyst at Smith Barney Citigroup","That's fine, Bob. So then let me ask a different question. You -- People & Places NSR growth moving forward, you mentioned P&Ps adjusted net revenue up 9% year-over-year. I think your main peers suggested this morning they are also seeing some acceleration in fiscal funding in the US, do you see IIJA-related funding continuing to accelerate from here? And do you think you could keep up or accelerate the kind of growth you recorded in Q3 into '24?"
"25","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","We do, we do. The IIJA component is really kind of in the -- I'd still say, it's in the early innings. But we're seeing that flow through. Andy, we actually got in front of that with the grant component, and -- and in assistance in the grant applications. That now coupled with the formulaic-based funding that's slowing has really helped. So yes, we do see that legislative -- legislation-driven funding, not just IIJA, but also the other legislation that's been passed. And that moving forward is going to continue to be a big piece.

The other thing that it's done is it has -- it's kind of stimulated other legislation -- legislative acts around the world. I think there's an EU Chips Act that we've now seen some of the components to, as well as Infrastructure Stimulus coming out in other parts of the world. So kind of the world's getting behind this."
"26","Andy Kaplowitz","Analyst at Smith Barney Citigroup","Appreciate the color, Bob."
"27","Operator",NA,"Your next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open."
"28","Jamie Cook","Analyst at Credit Suisse Group","Hi. Good morning. A nice quarter, and congrats, Kevin, and thanks for all your help as well throughout the years.

I guess [Speech Overlap] my first question understanding the margin story that you're talking about Consulting mix, project delivery, digital enabling, but as you -- depending what happens with CMS, and we have the new Jacobs, is there a greater opportunity on the cost side just to sort of restructure or streamline costs as well as what you're seeing on the project delivery or mix side? Just wondering if there's a cost story there.

And then my second question was -- it was nice to see the strong cash flow and the repurchase -- in the quarter here. Can you talk about sort of shorter-term capital allocation priorities, share repurchase, the way that investors should continue to think about things with -- acquisitions being more on the sidelines? Thank you."
"29","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Sure. Go ahead, Claudia."
"30","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you, Jamie.

On the first one the -- the cost opportunity, so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see the opportunity --day one, it's just the start. And with a more streamlined strategy and business model, we see lots of opportunities for more efficiencies as we can also leverage more our global delivery platform. So efficiencies, more focused strategy, and the agility that that will bring. So lots of opportunities on the cost optimization front.

On the capital allocation structure, we are -- we said it before, we are very happy with the opportunities we have. Our portfolio, we are focusing on our organic growth and we see it. We've been building this portfolio over time. We see the opportunities to invest in ourselves to continue delivering this growth. So we prioritized that and returning excess to our shareholders. So those are the priorities. And all that really on a risk-adjusted basis."
"31","Jamie Cook","Analyst at Credit Suisse Group","Thank you."
"32","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you."
"33","Operator",NA,"Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open."
"34","Jerry Revich","Analyst at The Goldman Sachs Group","Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. And Kevin, congratulations, thinking your nearly -- nine years of stock has nearly quadrupled too. Well done. And Claudia, congratulations again."
"35","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you."
"36","Jerry Revich","Analyst at The Goldman Sachs Group","I'm wondering if I could just ask on Advanced Facilities, just based on the disclosures, looks like that's about a quarter of People & Places. At this point, it's a really good performance so far. Can you just talk about, given the backlog in that business, is there one way for that portion of the portfolio to be 30% or more in People & Places over the next year or two? Just if you could touch on the backlog, Bob, if you don't mind."
"37","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Sure. Yeah, Jerry. That's a great way of looking at it. The short answer is yes. We see it as a larger part of our portfolio moving forward. Backlog is robust. And I guess, what really gives us some confidence in the continued growth, and Kevin mentioned that it was -- it's been six quarters, but just to kind of step back, we've been in growth mode in this business for probably the better part of the last four years. It's what's happening in the industry. You talked about reshoring, but specifically in Life Sciences, and it's been well-published, the level of technology coming out was really driven by oncology in the past, but now we're seeing things with regards to obesity, and then the obesity drugs that are having a positive effect on heart disease, we're seeing that in our in our pipeline and in our backlog with the Tier 1 customers that we've been doing work for, for ages. That coupled with the Chips Act and all that's going on in the EV world, we got -- the tailwinds would give us confidence that that is going to be a bigger percentage of our portfolio."
"38","Jerry Revich","Analyst at The Goldman Sachs Group","Thank you."
"39","Operator",NA,"Your next question is from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open."
"40","Bert Subin","Analyst at Stifel Nicolaus","Hey. Good morning and congratulations both Kevin and Claudia."
"41","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Thanks, Bert."
"42","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Thank you, Bert."
"43","Bert Subin","Analyst at Stifel Nicolaus","Maybe just a follow-up on that question, Bob. If you think that Advanced Facilities is going to become a larger part of the business and the rest of the business is sort of already on track to grow high single-digits, at least in the medium term, does that lead you to believe that that business can continue growing double-digits for a period of time?"
"44","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","I think right now the indications are, yes. The visibility that we have -- we have visibility from a project standpoint, probably six months to nine months out. What we're basing our competence in is the continued trends in technology. So, short answer is yes."
"45","Bert Subin","Analyst at Stifel Nicolaus","Got it. And then just a broader P&PS question, can you just sort of walk us through what sequentially changes I guess as we think about the fourth quarter? I know FX will become relative tailwind, but your guidance would seem to imply that margins remain at or above sort of the targeted range that you guys have out there with sales potentially also stepping up, so is that in your view sort of largely driven by IIJA ramp, you starting to see product [Phonetic] come through, or is there something else that's boosting that?"
"46","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Go ahead, Kev. [Phonetic]"
"47","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","No, look, I would say, it's a variety of things. Good execution, certainly, good growth as it relates to those businesses that we've already discussed in our prepared remarks. And so I think it positions us well to end the year well. And ultimately, continue to drive forward in 2024."
"48","Bert Subin","Analyst at Stifel Nicolaus","Great. Thank you, Kevin. Thanks, Bob."
"49","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah, thank you, Bert."
"50","Operator",NA,"Your next question is from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open."
"51","Sean Eastman","Analyst at KeyBanc","Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. And Kevin, I just wanted to say very impressive CFO tenure. Congratulations.

I wanted to press Claudia on the efficiencies and streamlining comments a little bit more. I realize it's early days, but I'm just curious where we should expect to see that enhancement? Is it kind of across all the segments? Is it more so in the corporate costs?

And then also, Kevin, I think you made a comment about the corporate costs remaining elevated for a short amount of time, so I wondered if that run rate is expected to step down going into next year? Some clarity there would also be helpful."
"52","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah. Thank you, Sean.

So, first, I want to say, the work is underway, right? So part of the separation is understanding the entanglements and all that, so just so you know. [Phonetic] And we will be sharing a lot more as we progress in this -- in the process, so to explain it is, one, [Phonetic] there are many, many functions or task and processes that you have when you -- for different sectors there, and that's -- so that applies to different functions, is it support functions, is it workflows and so on. So, Sean, you can think of, is it finance? Put numbers to that. Is it HR, is it the delivery model, and so on.

So as you simplify and streamline, you see those efficiencies. Also, the ability to share data depending on where you operate. So it really goes to multiple levels, and as I said, we will be sharing that as we progress, and the process, and the work is underway. And it's a very well-structured process and a standout management office that we have. To give you an idea, it's around 25 workstreams that we have all the different functions, and in operations and everywhere where we operate.

And as I said before, one key element of that is our very strong model of the global delivery platform. So that allows us to extract further efficiencies as we maximize the use of that platform."
"53","Sean Eastman","Analyst at KeyBanc","Okay. Thanks for that.

And my follow-up would be for Bob. I think it was relative to PPS but I think you made a comment about being able to continue to grow at current rates. So I just wanted to flush out as much as we can relative to the top-line growth expectations for remain Co. [Phonetic] on a go-forward."
"54","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Sure. We -- we've set to the 6% to 9% [Phonetic] long-term topline growth rate and that was what my comment was referring to. And right now, we've got some nice tailwinds behind us, so the higher end of that range is where we are."
"55","Sean Eastman","Analyst at KeyBanc","Okay. Very helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks."
"56","Operator",NA,"Your next question is from the line of Chad Dillard with Alliance Bernstein. Your line is open."
"57","Chad Dillard","Analyst at Alliance Bernstein","Hi. Good morning, guys. And I just wanted to extend my congrats to you, Kevin.

So I want to spend some time on the water business. I think you talked about it being a $2 billion business. Can you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of like a pipeline -- from a pipeline perspective? How to think about the growth rate and margin relative to the broader P&PS targets?"
"58","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Sure, Chad. The pipeline within the water sector, and I'm talking globally, it's probably the fastest-growing pipeline that we have in the business. And that is in the 30%, 40% year-on-year growth in the pipeline. So very robust, being driven by its infrastructure, EPA regulations in the States, as well as just the need for water. The drought-infested areas of not just the US, and all that's happening around climate change, and then our climate response is driving the need. This need is being funded in a whole variety of sources. I mean these are user fees, these are supplemented by certain government actions that are happening around the world. So all kind of the drivers are strong and they're not going away. The need is high and governments and state and municipal areas are standing behind it. So we're right in the middle of it.

And as you know, Chad, we've been a leader in that sector for decades, and that's really coming through."
"59","Chad Dillard","Analyst at Alliance Bernstein","That's helpful. And how should we think about just the growth rate of that business and margins relative to the broader P&PS segment?"
"60","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah, I'd say margins right now are above kind of the main margins within the sector -- within this sector today. I think there is some room there. And I think that it's going to continue to be a major part of our overall enterprise-wide portfolio moving forward."
"61","Chad Dillard","Analyst at Alliance Bernstein","That's helpful. And then I think you talked about some restructuring PA. Just trying to get a sense for how to think about any future costs, how to think about margin benefits? And when to think it will actually kind of hit the full run rate of those cost-saving initiatives?"
"62","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Kevin, you want to take it?"
"63","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Are you talking specifically on PA or what --"
"64","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Would be just PA."
"65","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Just PA?"
"66","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah."
"67","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Well, look, the cost actions have been taken so we're expecting on a go-forward basis that that will improve the margins. We have been talking about utilization and rightsizing the business for a while, and ultimately, the management team got to the point where they decided to proactively go after it as opposed to grow into it. And so we're excited about the ability for that to have taken place. Really good work by the management team. And so that run rate is effectively being embedded into the business going forward."
"68","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah. Sustainable."
"69","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","And sustainable."
"70","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah."
"71","Operator",NA,"Your next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open."
"72","Steven Fisher","Analyst at UBS Group","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. And Kevin, best wishes, and thanks for all the help.

I wanted to zoom into the P&PS profit growth you were talking before about the topline at the high-end. Just about the 13% year-over-year profit growth in Q3, where do you see is that going? Is that -- I mean, it was a -- still double-digit but it was a slow down from 21% the quarter before. So I guess, is this sort of normalizing into a low double-digit trajectory from here or is this -- do you think there is an actual reacceleration here? just trying to think about how to frame the expectation for that profit growth in Q4 and into 2024."
"73","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah. Steve, I think you know from a sustained standpoint, we've been vocal that we could drive double-digit growth from a bottom-line perspective. I think there was an earlier question around mix, so we're going to have events where we might get some -- some parts in the business, but I'd say, on a sustained, go-forward basis, that double-digit growth in the sustaining area where it's at now, is the way to think about it."
"74","Steven Fisher","Analyst at UBS Group","Okay. That's helpful. And then a bigger-picture question here, Bob. I'm curious how you're managing the business with regard to the broader economic outlook. There's clearly lots of talk about different types of lendings [Phonetic] for the economy -- what are you planning for at the moment -- about seven to eight weeks away from the start of your next fiscal year? So how is that affecting the decisions you're making today? Obviously, you're being proactive in streamlining operations, but I'm curious if the different economic lendings are factoring into your decision-making one way or the other?"
"75","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah. I'd say a couple of [Technical Issue] things [Phonetic], Steve. One is that we have been very deliberate over the course of several years, and Kevin and I have talked a lot about it over the last at least years, and now you're hearing Claudia say the same thing is that we feel comfortable of those end-markets that we are acutely focused in on, have got strong tailwinds. Nobody is going to say that they are resilient of recession, but those tailwinds aren't going anywhere and are probably less tied to inflation than other consumer-driven type of type of areas. And even in the area that we have some exposure to the broader consumer, these are now in the world of Life Sciences and chips and broad-based manufacturing that is tied to geopolitical as well as geo-economic kind of reshaping of the world.

So from a portfolio standpoint, we feel strong, and wherever the economy is going those tailwinds, we feel confident in. The other is around operations and our cost posture. We're doing a lot right now on the operating model and how we run the company and how we go to market. And we're using this inflection point with the separation of CMS to even accelerate that component, talked a little bit about in the prepared remarks. So that's creating more internal resilience.

And then the last, I would say is something that Claudia spoke about earlier, and that's [Technical Issue] cost optimization. We have known, as Steve you've known us for a long time, for decades, we have been a company that has been very acutely focused in on cost and cost management, and that's in our DNA. And we're going to continue to do that as we continue to look at the leaner structure prospects. [Phonetic]"
"76","Steven Fisher","Analyst at UBS Group","Terrific. Thank you."
"77","Operator",NA,"Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Your line is open."
"78","Andrew Whitmann","Analyst at Robert W. Baird","Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. And Kevin, it's been a pleasure.

I guess I wanted to ask about some of the cash restructuring costs, it looks like they're down, the new outlook for them. The split of cash is up a little bit, noncash real estate down a little bit. I suppose that's probably related to the $17 million for PA taken in the quarter on cash restructuring. But I guess there's kind of two questions that come out of this: one is, do you think that this round of restructuring charges can flow through to the profit line, recognizing in the past, the various restructuring programs you've had in the past, have generally been reinvested for growth.

And the second question would be, given that '23 is a little bit higher on the cash restructuring costs, what do you think the outlook for '24 could be? Obviously, the CMS then -- or potential sale is a big factor but do you think that the costs will be up or down versus the roughly $55 million of cash cost that you expect to recognize in 2023? Thanks"
"79","Kevin Berryman","President & Chief Financial Officer at Jacobs Solutions","[Speech Overlap] Maybe -- thanks, Andy, but let me take a stab. As Claudia suggested in her prepared remarks, we're working through that right now as we speak relative to the CMS separation efforts, and so it's premature to really give any perspective on that. I think the bottom line relative to your cash comment for 2023 is basically correct. And so at the end of the day, I think the other point that you asked is it going to be -- it's going to drop to the bottom line or be reinvested? I think that Claudia has made it very clear in her comments that the stranded costs or opportunities are, we believe, of substance. And that's going to take a lot of hard work to get after it. But I think we'll leave it there.

And fundamentally, I think what the plan will be is that we'll give some additional color, or Claudia and Bob will give some additional color when we talk in our Q4 -- Q4 earnings release and outlook for 2024."
"80","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","And what I would add to that, Andy, is, we use the cash conversion as a key metric for us. So it's really important to show is the cash conversion and we have shown the strong cash conversion. So all these numbers is to help our investors understand the numbers. Hopefully, that helps to analyze the numbers, but the cash conversion remains very strong and we are fully -- we are very committed to maintaining that strong delivery."
"81","Andrew Whitmann","Analyst at Robert W. Baird","Got it. Thanks.

I guess for my follow-up question I would just ask about Divergent here. I heard the comments for the fourth quarter. This business has always had kind of an implicit kind of ramp that you believe that some of the contracts that you're on will start contributing more significantly. I guess the question is, what's the visibility you have into that ramp and do you still believe that -- that revenue ramp can lead to better fixed-cost coverage and push margins up more materially even than you've realized in the last couple of quarters, which has been notable for sure?"
"82","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah, Andy, we do. And part of that is, if you look, if you kind of dissect the virgin, as we've talked about in previous quarters, the area that's going -- growing at the fastest rate are those platforms that we've developed around transportation and water. And those are growing very fast.

Now the reason why we're not necessarily seeing that at the top line is because these are platforms that are driving growth at the bottom line for Divergent and creating margin expansion in P&PS, part of that digital enablement of an earlier question too. So from a bottom line standpoint, the answer would be yes, we see that visibility and it's being driven by infrastructure, transportation, and water, and we're getting those platforms now into the energy sector as well. So more to follow on how that's going to continue to catalyze P&PS."
"83","Andrew Whitmann","Analyst at Robert W. Baird","Thanks a lot."
"84","Operator",NA,"[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open."
"85","Sabahat Khan","Analyst at RBC Capital Markets","Hey. Great. Thanks.

Just I guess on some of the infrastructure stimulus money that you said you've seen so far. I'm just curious which end markets that's concentrated in? Sort of where are you winning some work? And then -- and as you look ahead even to the kind of the next 12 months to 18 months, which end markets do you think will probably see more of that money whether it's IIJA, IRA, or the Chips Act? Just curious how it's flowing by end market at this point?"
"86","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Sure, Sabahat. It's really the early phase of the early innings have been -- probably indexed more towards transportation. So we're seeing more in that, but now we're kind of starting to see the front-end of different -- I mentioned, the New Orleans job where we're doing some green fleeting of the bus systems and the other transport.

So under the guise of transport with now some clean energy components that are tied to it, and we'll start to spillover in some IRA application as well. I would say on the larger -- whether it'd be some of the lead [Phonetic] free work or -- I'm sorry, the lead pipe and the lead topic work as well as some additional support of some of the larger water infrastructure, we would expect to see that coming up too.

So transport first, moving into clean energy, and the energy component of transport, and then down the road, water."
"87","Sabahat Khan","Analyst at RBC Capital Markets","Great. And then just more of a housekeeping-type question on the cost improvements that you've talked about on P&PS. I just don't understand, is that -- is the kind of -- just going full throttle on the plan tied to the timing of the sale or separation of CMS business, or is that something that's ongoing and we should see a meaningful benefit in your fiscal '24 number? Just trying to understand if those two events are tied in terms of timing of when you execute and the savings that we see in fiscal '24."
"88","Claudia Jaramillo","Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah, so the PA -- the PA comment is really focused on PA and it's more aligned with the end markets that PA has, so they have a lot of strength in specific markets. And that is more aligning their resources with that strength in some markets, and then what they see in the other markets that are more flat. So that's really PA related.

And then CMS is more the connectivity between CMS and the rest of the company and the comments that Bob made about our efforts looking at our operating model and all the efficiency gains and productivity that we see as we have cost reductions with a more streamlined strategy and execution."
"89","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","And to see those in '24, Sabahat, which I think is the last part with P&PS, the answer is yes."
"90","Sabahat Khan","Analyst at RBC Capital Markets","[Indecipherable] thinking about the other savings from P&PS. Okay, so we should see them in '24?"
"91","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","Yeah."
"92","Sabahat Khan","Analyst at RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Great."
"93","Operator",NA,"There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Bob Pragada."
"94","Bob Pragada","Chief Operating Officer at Jacobs Solutions","All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining, and look forward to continued growth and success. Kevin, thank you so much, and welcome, Claudia, to the future. Thanks, everyone. Look forward to talking to you next time."
