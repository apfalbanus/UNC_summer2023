In a statement, the agency says two polling locations in Indigenous communities in the Alberta riding of Grand Prairie-Mackenzie were locked and could not be opened to voters until 1 p-m., after facilities staff were located. One polling station in Yekooche (yeh-KOO'-chee) First Nation in B-C has not opened at all so far. Meanwhile, Elections Canada relocated a polling station in Brantford-Brant in Ontario after a protest by the Haudenosaunee (hoh-dee-noh-SHOH'-nee) Confederacy Chiefs Council barred anyone from entering. In a statement last week, the confederacy called the government's decision to open a polling station on the First Nation a treaty violation. Although most polling stations elsewhere opened without incident, Elections Canada also noted several other disruptions, including special arrangements that had to be made in Toronto-area ridings to manage the flow of voters while respecting COVID-19 safety measures. --- Subject: Voting machines"

"2021-09-23","Full text: Canadians went to the polls on Monday to decide whether to keep the Liberals in government or choose an alternative. Here's what a handful of young voters waiting outside two polling stations in downtown Toronto had to say about what was compelling them to vote. “Every election has different issues, obviously these ones are pertaining to the times, to the pandemic and immigration issues as well, and those are issues that are important to me, so I'm pretty excited to have a voice.” Biggest issues? “Just the way that the pandemic has been handled, obviously, to the best of its abilities and in comparison to other countries. And there are certain platforms that are just promoting, I'm not going to name any names, but certain platforms that are preaching more hate than acceptance, so I think that it's really important if you want to see a change or if you want to see a continuation of what you've been seeing, then it's important to be out here voting right now.” “I'm excited to have a voice, everybody deserves to be heard. It's my first time voting and I just felt like I had to because I've got to stand up for what I believe in, and I just think that we're being pushed around. “All these politicians lie. Justin Trudeau, I'm going to have to drop that name bomb, but I'm just not a fan of what he's been doing to the country. Lots of his beliefs are very strong I guess, and I just have a different opinion...” “Personally, for me, (the biggest issue) would probably be this whole mandating the vaccine and making it mandatory. My family members have got the vaccine and this and that, but the fact that my job can be threatened and my entertainment life, and all of the above, it just seems pretty narrowing and cutting everything off. You can't travel, you can't go to a restaurant, you can't go to a movie unless you've been vaccinated, and it just seems like what can you do then. You can go for a run, sure, but you can't go to a gym without being vaccinated. How does he expect these other people who don't want to be vaccinated to live like this? If he truly believes in equality, why are these people being treated so unequal?” “I feel like the election caught most people by surprise, including myself, so I wouldn't say that I'm excited to be here, but I feel like we should be here as Canadians to vote.” Biggest issues? “The recovery after the pandemic, well we're still kind of in the pandemic, but looking forward how they're going to support families, all the people who lost their jobs, all the businesses that closed. It's a very different landscape now. And for me personally, climate change and how Canada is going to address that I think is a high-priority item.” On vaccine mandates becoming an election issue: “I feel like people have taken those issues and extended them to be about human rights and freedoms, but I think that falls short of the bigger picture, that it's protecting the most vulnerable in our society. I don't like how it's been politicized, to be honest. It's a public health issue, not a political issue.” “I think it was a little rushed. I wasn't exactly excited that it was called, but I am excited about the traction ... the NDP is getting. They've been getting significantly more traction now than they have been in the last few elections. “I think they will make some good changes that are necessary to move forward as a country as a whole. For me particularly, it's the relationship with Indigenous communities and how they actually seem to want to make change going forward and pursue truth and reconciliation rather than brushing things under the rug, which I feel like has been happening for too long. “A big issue for me also is the homelessness in Toronto, and they've talked a lot about getting more affordable housing in the city, affordable housing in general in Canada. It just happens to be a big issue here. I think that's something we need to be focusing on because it's not always the people's fault that they're homeless, it's usually just the world they live in, the society we live in that's made them go there. “The climate crisis is so terrifying that I end up somehow just forgetting it because it's so constantly there. But I definitely think it's a big conversation point now and something we need to focus on. “If we don't have a world to live in, then what's the point of all the other issues? So I'd say it's probably the biggest thing to take care of.” “I've heard what some of the different parties, like the PPC ... have said about immigrants, and as someone who comes from an immigrant family, I didn't respect that at all. So I think it's very important to vote, and not just vote because they said, 'We don't need a vaccine passport.' Your vote affects a lot of other people, and I feel like some people forget about that, they're like, 'I'm not in that group of people, so it doesn't matter to me.' “Some of us are like 30 and still living without parents, and it's hard to get a place right now. I'm very lucky that I have the apartment that I do, but now they're going to tear that down soon, and we're going to have to pay way more, so I'm hoping that something's actually done for that because it's really hard right now just to find a place to live.” On climate change: “People think, 'Oh, we can worry about it later,' but do you see what's happening to the planet right now? We need to speak about it now. We need to stop brushing it (aside) like it's absolutely nothing because it is everything, not just for us but for our kids, for the future, all of that.” Subject: Noncitizens; Families & family life; Vaccines; Affordable housing; Homeless people; Climate change; Pandemics"

The agency says there have been intermittent issues with the service on election day, and they're encouraging people to check their voting cards or call the agency's toll-free number directly. Elections Canada had previously warned the pandemic could lead to longer waits for voters compared to past elections, though so far they say they've seen nothing unusual. The polling stations themselves are also likely to be farther away, as schools and landlords opted out of hosting crowds of voters during the fourth wave of the pandemic.

Speaking outside his party's campaign headquarters in Burnaby, B-C, today, Singh said he was proud of the work his team had done. Singh was one of almost 6.8-million people who cast their votes early -- most of them at advance polls over a week ago, and the rest through special ballots cast by mail or at Elections Canada offices.

Doctor Joss Reimer, with the province's vaccine implementation group, says this eligibility will eventually extend to all residents in personal care homes.

Saint-Joseph-du-Lac Mayor Benoit Proulx says there have been at least four incidents in the lower Laurentians town in the past two weeks. Local police have launched investigations after two vehicles were set on fire since Friday, including one owned by a municipal councillor and another belonging to the wife of the town's director-general. The wife of another municipal councillor lost a wheel while driving on a major highway last week, with the bolts having allegedly been replaced and loosened.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (ah-leh-HAHN'-droh my-OHR'-kuhs) says the government is working to increase its transport capacity to return an influx of Haitian migrants back to their home country.

"2021-09-23","Full text: Many Kingstonians are concerned about a text message they are receiving from the Conservative Party before election day. While some are taking it lightly, others are angry about how the party got their cell numbers when they are not supporting them. The messages read ""Should Justin Trudeau be rewarded for calling an unnecessary $650m pandemic election? I don't think so. Do you? - Amy from Canada's Conservatives"". Some people are even receiving multiple messages which were not at all very well received. The message asks for support for the party in the current election. It is a robotext coming from an automatic messaging program. In Canada, the area codes of phone numbers are publicly available through the Canadian Numbering [and Dialling] Plan, which the Canadian Numbering Administrator manages. The codes are then put into a robocaller program which can send text messages to all possible combinations with multiple last four digits. “The numbers we contact fall into one of two categories—they're either numbers that Canadians have voluntarily provided us, or they're randomly generated programmatically through the use of a software program,” Conservative Party spokesperson told Cory Hann to Vice in 2019. “Some numbers will work, some will not, some will exist, some don't at all.“ If the respondents reply positively to a text, they'll ask the person to provide additional information such as their name and address. People are mostly worried about why it is that they are receiving text messages from a particular party when they had never registered for updates in the first place. Robotexts have been increasing in use since early 2019 when the Conservative Party of Canada used a similar tactic to reach voters. At that time, texts were sent by ""Sarah from Canada's Conservatives."" The Canada Elections Act permits the use of automated messages (calls, texts, etc.). Many parties have been using them to either support their policies or get votes for the ongoing elections. They then use this to evaluate whether you are likely a supporter or a supporter of your policies. Political robotexting isn't limited to the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party and NDP have used this strategy in the past as well. According to the Conservative Party website, if someone wants to stop receiving calls or texts, they can contact the National Service Desk at servicedesk@conservative.ca or 1-866-808-8407 and make requests.

"2021-09-23","Full text: Justin Trudeau's Liberals win second minority OTTAWA - Canadians have chosen another minority Liberal government — almost identical to the one it replaced — to finish the fight against COVID-19 and rebuild the shattered economy. Precisely how stable a minority remains to be seen, as results were still trickling in and there were tight contests in dozens of ridings as the clock started running out on Monday night. There are also almost 800,000 mail-in ballots to be counted, starting Tuesday, which could yet change the preliminary results in many of those tightly contested seats. Late Monday, Justin Trudeau's Liberals were leading or elected in 157 seats — exactly the same number they won in 2019, 13 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the House of Commons. Erin O'Toole's Conservatives were leading or elected in 121 seats, the same as in 2019 even though they won slightly more of the popular vote than the Liberals, as they did last time. Jagmeet Singh's NDP were leading or elected in 29, a gain of five seats, while Yves-François Blanchet's Bloc Québécois was down three at 29. The Greens, which elected three MPs in 2019, was down to two. Leader Annamie Paul, who had faced an internal insurrection last spring, was projected to come in fourth place in Toronto Centre in her third try to wrest that seat from the Liberals. Maxime Bernier's People's Party, which ran on an anti-public health restrictions platform, didn't come close to winning a seat anywhere but pulled enough votes from the Conservatives to rob them of victory in a number of close races, particularly in Ontario. The upshot raises questions about the judgment and strategy of both Trudeau and O'Toole. Trudeau pulled the plug on his minority Liberal government on Aug. 15, a little less than two years after Canadians first reduced the Liberals to a minority. He argued that Canada was at a pivotal moment in history and Canadians deserved a chance to decide how they wanted to finish the fight against COVID-19 and build back the shattered economy. But the timing of his election call, coming as a fourth wave of the novel coronavirus was beginning to sweep the country, quickly sapped the goodwill Trudeau had built among Canadians for his government's handling of the pandemic over the previous 18 months. And it gave rival leaders an opening to attack Trudeau's character, describing him as a selfish egoist who can't be trusted to put the interests of Canadians ahead of his personal ambition to secure a majority. O'Toole won his party's leadership last year by courting social conservatives but then ditched his ""true blue"" image in a bid to broaden his party's appeal outside its Western Canada base. He presented himself to voters as a moderate with pricey centrist policies, including a plan to put a price on carbon, which his party had previously pilloried as a job-killing tax on everything. But the move did not produce the hoped-for breakthrough for the Conservatives in Ontario or Quebec, where the Liberals once again won the lion's share of the seats. They did make some modest gains in Atlantic Canada. The NDP lost its lone Atlantic seat, St. John's East, to the Liberals. It had been held by New Democrat Jack Harris, who did not seek re-election. Trudeau cabinet ministers Seamus O'Regan, Dominic LeBlanc and Lawrence MacAulay cruised to victory. But Bernadette Jordan, who served as fisheries minister, lost to her Conservative rival in Nova Scotia's South Shore-St. Margarets, evidently hurt by the lobster fishery dispute between Indigenous and non-Indigenous fishers in the region. In Fredericton, N.B., Jenica Atwin, the former Green MP who defected to the Liberals last spring, was in a tight, see-saw battle with the Conservatives. Green support largely collapsed throughout the region. There are almost one million mail-in ballots that election officials won't start counting until Tuesday. Elections Canada has said it expects to finish the mail-in count in most ridings by Wednesday, but some may take another day or two. According to Elections Canada, almost 6.8 million people voted early, most of them at advance polls over a week ago, and the rest through special ballots cast by mail or at Elections Canada offices. Canada has more than 30 million eligible voters. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 20, 2021.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Lambton-Kent-Middlesex candidates and voters turned out in Brooke-Alvinston Tuesday night as the election campaign enters its final week. Sudit Ranade, Liberals; Jason Henry, NDP; Kevin Mitchell, PPC; and Jeremy Hull, Greens, appeared at the Optimist Pavilion to discuss their visions with a few dozen curious constituents. Conservative MP Lianne Rood didn’t show up to the debate and has not participated in any of them so far. Hosted by the three local agriculture federations; like their forum with Sarnia-Lambton candidates in Brigden last week the focus for the sweeping riding was farming and agriculture. The evening had a more jovial tone as all answers were applauded by the crowd. Spirits were perhaps bolstered by the absence of a major thunderstorm which had caused numerous power outages at the fairgrounds. Farmland itself was a major topic. Jay Cunningham, president of the Kent Federation of Agriculture, says less than five per cent of land mass in Ontario remains arable for farming and this number gets smaller every day. Henry, who serves as chief of Kettle and Stony Point, says the problem starts with farmers being put in a situation where they just can’t maintain the land. “If farmers and farm families have the ability to have a sustainable future in that business with family that would take over, they wouldn’t be pressured to sell.” “If we can help uphold the farmers and their businesses then it will be easier for them to hold onto that land,” says Henry. Ranade says the issue starts away from the rural areas with urban sprawl. The chief medical officer of health for Lambton County promotes building up instead of out as cities and towns get bigger. The rookie Liberal candidate also called for more innovative use of existing space, “restoring things you have or finding new ways to use the space you have to live there. Ranade also says multi-generational living should be prioritized. “More and more people want to be able to live with their parents as they age… but maybe not right with them,” he joked. People’s Party candidate Kevin Mitchell had his own take, blaming immigrants for the loss of farmland. “You see more and more immigrants spreading through the country… They cause farmland to be bought up because we have to build more housing. We have to limit immigration and be much more strategic with it immediately,” he says. Mitchell claimed “we have 76 per cent of immigrants that are coming over with no skilled trades, no money and nothing to contribute."" He did not cite where this number came from. “I’m not sure that statistic on immigration is one that I’ve seen,” countered Ranade. Mitchell’s position that immigrants are a “drain on our economy” garnered reaction from the crowd with a mix of claps and boos. “I’m a proud daughter of immigrants!” yelled one woman in attendance. Mitchell says the responses are in line with his goal of “ruffling feathers.” Hull also says better use of existing buildings would be a preferable approach to new construction on farmland. “Retrofitting is definitely a way to go.” Of course farmland is no good if there’s no one to work it. The candidates debated how to keep young people interested in either entering or sticking with the industry. Hull proposed an “entrepreneurship or internship program where new farmers are set up with experienced farmers so they can learn the skill and the trade properly. The experience of the older farmer we’ve got to have.” Ranade says he would look to the community for answers. “There are some families that have been fairly successful at moving their children and their grandchildren into the business. And there are others where that hasn’t happened.” “If we can understand what makes the difference between the two we can start to enable more people to be a part of family businesses,” he says. Henry says this career path needs to be addressed from an early age. “For some reason maybe we’ve told our kids that’s it’s not an honourable trade,” says Henry of how farming is discussed by parents and in schools. The chief says many kids he went to school with and thought would become farmers have gone a different route. “It’s too hard and I was taught in school to do something different,” Henry recalls of conversations with them. He says the option of smaller farms should be promoted as well as how much technology is involved in farming today. Perhaps unexpectedly Mitchell and Henry found some common ground on the topic, though the PPC candidate’s approach toward schools was a bit more radical. “One of the many structures that really needs to be torn down and re-evaluated is how we educate our children,” says Mitchell, adding schools need to offer a “more wide variety of education possibilities.” The candidates also spoke on the environment and Canada’s pledge to reach a net zero of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “I think we have to make sure we have breaks for farmers who are doing their part reducing their carbon footprint,” says Henry. “Farmers are at the forefront of green energy and climate change and need to be supported as such.” “We have to make sure we’re supporting green energy projects and that we’re transitioning now… Domestically we have to make sure that the carbon tax is applied to polluters and not to the consumers,” added Henry. Ranade agreed a transition is the way forward, but we must be cautious about it. “You have to move fast enough to make a difference but slow enough to bring people along with you… It’s about making sure that people are enabled through the transition together as a community.” To that end both candidates support keeping Line 5 open for now during a transition to greener energy and retraining Chemical Valley workers to perform new jobs when that eventually takes place. Mitchell says the PPC is “all about the environment” despite their platform saying there’s “no scientific consensus on the theory that CO2 produced by human activity is causing dangerous global warming today or will in the future.” He says a PPC government would ditch the Paris Accords and “tear all this environmental stuff down to the studs and rebuild it so that we can make a better environmental impact without handcuffing and making life less affordable for Canadians.” Subject: Noncitizens; Agriculture; Families & family life; Farmers; Schools; Candidates; Climate change; Immigration; Farms; Elections"

"2021-09-22","Full text: --- (FedElxn-Voting-Lines) Some voters in the Greater Toronto Area are facing longer lineups than usual to cast their ballots in the federal election. Elections Canada says there are fewer places to vote as many schools and landlords of apartment buildings opted out of hosting crowds of voters during the fourth wave of the pandemic. Many polling stations moved into larger buildings with more booths, but 680 News is reporting some voters in Spadina-Fort York had to wait as long as 90 minutes to cast a ballot. Elections Canada says some polls had seen isolated delays in getting set up, which created some longer waits, but nothing unusual compared to years past. (CityNews, 680News, The Canadian Press) --- (COVID-Ont) The city of Toronto says almost 88 per cent of staff who disclosed their status are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and five per cent have received only their first shot. It says 87 per cent of the active workforce disclosed their vaccination status as required by last Friday under the city's mandatory vaccination policy for employees. It says staff who have not been fully vaccinated or who did not disclose their vaccination status will be required to complete mandatory education starting this week. The city has set a deadline of September 30th for staff to get a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and October 30th to receive both doses -- but it's providing accommodation for those unable to get the shot. (The Canadian Press) --- (Ont--Oshawa-Fentanyl) Police say they have busted a large fentanyl trafficking ring in Durham Region, east of Toronto, following a five-month investigation. Police say the operation has made a significant impact on the availability of the deadly opioid in areas experiencing high overdose rates. They say it resulted in the seizure of 5.8 kilograms of fentanyl, 4.2 kilograms of cocaine, eight handguns and 300-thousand dollars in cash. Durham regional police also say 44 people have been arrested and face a total of nearly 300 charges. (The Canadian Press) --- (Ont-Apartment-Fire) Police and the Ontario Fire Marshal's Office are investigating a fatal apartment building fire in Collingwood early this morning. Provincial police, firefighters and paramedics were called to the four-storey building shortly after 1 a-m. They say one person was found dead but all other occupants of the building are safe. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. (The Canadian Press) --- (Ont-Oshawa-Stabbing) Police are searching for a teenage girl in connection with the stabbing of another teen on school property in Oshawa. Police say they received a call about the stabbing just after 6 p-m yesterday. They say a 15-year-old girl was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening wounds. They say the suspect fled the area before officers arrived. (The Canadian Press) --- (Copper-Wire-Thefts) Provincial police are searching for a suspect believed to be responsible for three separate thefts of copper wire from Hydro One substations in Minden Hills Township. Police say the thefts, with a combined value of about seven-thousand dollars, occurred between August 25th and September 5th. The O-P-P say they located a suspect vehicle in a parking lot in Minden last Tuesday and tried to make an arrest. But they say the suspect fled at a high speed and officers disengaged due to public safety concerns.

"2021-09-22","Full text: SOUTH BRUCE – The answers are in, from an independent survey conducted in South Bruce recently to determine the term “willingness.” The municipality hired an independent company to conduct the survey, part of the ongoing debate over whether or not the construction of a deep geological repository (DGR) by the Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) is welcome in the area. GDH Consulting Corporation surveyed rate-payers in the South Bruce jurisdiction and drafted a report released on Sept. 7. Of the 229 residents polled, 136 confirmed a referendum as their preferred method to determine willingness for the DGR. The survey identified six themes, based on recurring ideas or comments or those that shared similar sentiments. Each of the themes GHD identified as described below and not presented in any order of importance. Overwhelming preference for public referendum A public referendum emerged as causing the most discussion and was preferred by most participants. Participants said that a referendum is fair, allows everyone in the municipality a vote, is anonymous, and is a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. The report said, “some participants noted that a referendum is the only way to determine willingness and a strong dislike for any other means.” This perspective was not shared by all participants, though, the report said. “When participants were asked what processes they dislike, referendum was the second most common response, after vote of council. Concerns with public referendum included low voter turnout, voters may not be adequately informed, and that a referendum has the potential to cause deeper divisions in the community.” Differing perspectives on timing of a referendum Participants raised a diversity of comments related to when a referendum should take place, including: • a referendum as part of the 2022 municipal election; • have a referendum as soon as possible; • a referendum should be held separately from the municipal election; and • more time should be taken before a referendum is held or preferred community engagement activities (i.e., in-person, online, surveys, etc.) in combination with or in advance of a referendum. Diversity of perspectives on other ways to determine willingness with common themes The report identified several advantages and disadvantages to a referendum, but no individual process for determining willingness emerged as strongly preferred. Instead, several participants noted a preference for a combination of methods, including other plans with a referendum, as stated above. When talking about the reasons, several common themes emerged across all processes: • importance of the decision being representative of the community and the community having a voice; • importance of being informed; • impartiality and protecting against bias, manipulation; and • concerns about mistrust and importance of building dialogue and not causing further division. Clear, accessible and unbiased information from trusted sources Several participants wanted a better understanding of the science and open, unbiased dialogue about the NWMO’s Project, including: • the results of the borehole drilling and the engineering and scientific studies; • sound evidence that this project can be built safely; • the risks and the contingency plans associated with the project; • access to the information in a way that is simple, clear, and easy to understand; • information available in a variety of formats (print, online, mailed, etc.) so that participants have access in a way that works for them; and • factual and unbiased information from an independent source. Broad representation Several participants noted the importance of broad representation: • everyone in South Bruce should have the opportunity to have a say in determining willingness; • importance of youth engagement and representation; • understanding what the Saugeen Ojibway Nation’s perspective on the project is and their process for determining willingness as well as the views of those outside South Bruce; and • more engagement/participation from community members in the project. Trust, mistrust, transparency and community divide Several participants provided comments related to mistrust and community divide: • the NWMO project has been difficult for the community, causing neighbours, friends, and family to be divided on the issue; • concerns that the community members did not feel safe to provide their input and opinions without being on “one-side or the other”; • lack of trust with the NWMO, municipal staff, council, and the Community Liaison Committee (CLC), and concerns about bias of CLC, council and municipal staff towards supporting the project; and • Concerns that GHD is biased towards supporting the project. Protect Our Waterways – No Nuclear Waste (POW-NNW) issued a press release after the announcement saying the organization is happy with the results. “We are pleased to see the Willingness Study reflect our long-held position,” said Michelle Stein, chairperson of POW-NNW. “A binding referendum is the only legitimate way to determine willingness. It guarantees everyone a voice and respects both their choice and their privacy.” Stein said that all residents should be allowed to have a voice in this momentous decision; an opportunity to state with a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote is the only way to make the decision fair. “Hosting the DGR will permanently change the character, reputation, and economy of our community. Every resident and business will have to live with the risks and any promised benefits for generations to come. Such a momentous decision cannot be made by a small group of people, however well-intentioned they may be,” said Stein. Added Stein, “We urge the mayor and council of South Bruce to move quickly and include a binding referendum as part of the next municipal election in October 2022. Our community must be given the opportunity to answer a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question on whether we want to host the NWMO’s DGR.” Steven Travale, communications and public relations officer for the Municipality of South Bruce, said in an email to Midwestern Newspapers, “as the report is currently presented as a draft, it has not been formally presented to council in an agenda yet, therefore council as a whole has not given any comments or direction on it.” Travale added, “Once the comment period ends on Sept. 24, the draft report and comments will be presented to the CLC for information at the October meeting, following which the final report will be presented to council in early November as part of an agenda.” Subject: Election results; Community; Councils; Referendums; Bias"

"2021-09-22","Full text: During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been used to doing things differently. When Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau called a snap election in August, many assumed Canadians would do the same when it came to voting. Canada Post braced to receive millions of mail-in ballots, while advance polls were expected to play a significant part. “We initially expected between two to three million [mail-in ballots],” a spokesperson for Elections Canada told The Pointer. “We are also encouraging all Canadians who have received a special ballot to get them on their way back to Elections Canada as soon as possible.” Estimates show key ridings in Peel Region have seen a dramatic drop in advanced voting. The number of mail-in ballots ordered in Brampton and Mississauga suggests remote voting will play a significant but not pivotal role in how the two cities’ 11 federal races are decided. Meanwhile, advance polling turnout over the four days when electors could cast ballots early at their local polling station was down dramatically in three Brampton ridings compared to 2019, sparking concern over a possible low election turnout if residents don’t head to the polls in large numbers on Monday. The Liberals won all of the city’s five seats comfortably in 2019 but very low turnout can cause upsets and render predictive polling almost irrelevant. “We need to know not only how people are planning on voting but who’s actually going to show up and vote,” Dr. Lorne Bozinoff, the president of Forum Research, told Ballot Vox, The Pointer’s election podcast. “You can do a survey of people and if there’s a lot of non-voters in that sample, what does it matter? It’s going to be misleading because they’re not voting.” Brampton East is one of Peel’s key battlegrounds and the area has seen its advance voting numbers drop off a cliff. A glitch in the Elections Canada system means around 52,000 people in the riding were not sent their voter information cards before advance polls opened and the issue appears to have had an impact on turnout. In 2019, 12,883 residents cast a vote early in Brampton East, roughly a quarter of all votes in the riding last election. This year, only 7,103 votes were cast during advance polling, a drop of around 45 percent. The riding will also be impacted by mail-in votes: 2,338 kits have been ordered to vote by mail as of September 16, almost five percent of the total 2019 turnout. Only 1,142 of those kits had been returned to Elections Canada, as of September 16."
"2021-09-22","Full text: A bustle of purple-clad supporters surrounded the Port Credit Memorial Park marquee in Mississauga, chatting and exchanging stories. After the Canadian national anthem, anticipation began to build. From Thursday morning, the stage was set for People’s Party Leader Maxime Bernier to arrive. A slowly dwindling number of supporters waited for 193 minutes. The gaggle of PPC faithful tried to fill time, with their leader apparently a mere 20-minute drive away in Oakville. As time dragged on and enthusiasm faded, the Mississauga PPC rally turned into a bizarre affair. One candidate gave the same speech twice, because “my cameraman missed it” — his claim that he is “not a politician” rang hollow the second time around. Slowly, as any semblance of organization floated off in the morning air, the stage morphed into an open mic platform for wild theories. As people mocked action to prevent climate change, the contracting crowd cheered. One of the many random speakers who commandeered the PA system said Canada doesn’t need more wind or solar energy and another proclaimed, “They want to control the climate, only God can do that”. Everyone gathered was waiting for one man. He has quickly become a cult-leader figure for millions across Canada including the loyal followers who waited hours to see their man in Port Credit. “Max inspires me, he really does,” Dave Shaw, a Mississauga resident who voted PPC in 2019, told The Pointer. “He’s so positive in his direction and freedoms he wants to give people that are being taken away by the other parties because they all walk the same line. Max is different.” Eventually, as the lunch hour passed and after standing under the sun for more than three hours, the main attraction jogged from the Port Credit Library parking lot toward the group assembled since the morning. Shouts of “Max is here” rippled among the maskless throng. He took the microphone and launched into a speech reminiscent of what took place south of the border on January 6, when the U.S. Capitol Building was stormed. “When tyranny becomes law, revolution becomes our duty,” Bernier told the crowd as chants of “freedom” filled the air. He trotted out the PPC’s standard talking points, focusing on COVID-19 and the need for “common sense” to return. His party has pushed anti-vaccination views throughout the election campaign, attracting a sizable fringe of loyalists who have driven up support according to polling numbers that suggest the PPC will be the biggest winner after the ballots are counted Monday, as some surveys show it could garner as much as eight percent of the electorate’s votes. Even if it fails to secure any seats in Parliament, extreme right wing politics has now found a home in Canada. “What they want freedom from is responsibility to their fellow Canadians, they want freedom from COVID and public health measures,” Evan Balgord, the executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, an organization that has been tracking the rise of the far-right including the PPC, told The Pointer. He listed numerous examples of PPC members being linked to Canada’s far-right. “It’s not freedom they want, it’s to act like children. Citizenship comes with freedoms and responsibilities, they want none of the responsibilities.” Whenever the speeches stopped, dog walkers strolled past as gentle music drifted above from two elderly women meditating nearby. Layered over the surrounding serenity, an angry mood competed with the otherwise calm Port Credit afternoon. Shouts of “medical segregation”, “tyranny” and “freedom” belted out from the small group of Bernier supporters. “We don’t need more legislation,” one speaker said, failing to explain why hundreds of candidates are seeking election to represent the PPC and push its own agenda on all Canadians in the national legislature. Another said municipalities were colluding with developers to raise house prices. In 2019, the PPC received a flurry of public and media attention. On polling day it proved to be too generous. Despite filling many column inches, Bernier’s upstart party — centred on anti-immigration sentiment in 2019 — received less than two percent of the vote and failed to win a single seat. The COVID-19 pandemic and a rise in anti-lockdown, anti-vaccine and anti-mask views have given the party a boost this time around. The marked shift of the Conservative Party, led by Erin O’Toole, toward the middle of the political spectrum, along with the ongoing disaffection caused by the pandemic, has created a pathway for Bernier to seize on extreme right-wing views. Disillusioned Conservative voters and those who have never voted before, in particular, have gravitated toward the PPC and its leader. The anti-vaccine sentiment in Port Credit Thursday (where supporters repeatedly referred to COVID-19 vaccines as “injections”) was particularly pronounced. There was no effort by Bernier to bring facts into the proceedings, as he failed to point to the volumes of scientific research and new data coming out that show how effective vaccines have been in the fight against COVID-19, nor was it mentioned that possibly billions of human lives have been saved because of vaccine science over the past 200 years. Polling has shown the PPC trending high in the 2021 federal election, outnumbering the Green Party almost around the country and even clipping the heels of NDP candidates in some races. Poll tracking for September 16 from EKOS Research put PPC support at eight percent in Ontario, compared to four percent for the Green Party and 20 percent for the NDP. One supporter who talked to The Pointer, Pete Emslie, has been a card-carrying member of the Conservative Party for years and voted for Erin O’Toole in its leadership race. He said he is a Rebel News reader and switched his support to the PPC after being frustrated by O’Toole’s shift to the centre. “I was happy when he won the leadership race, but everything I have been reading since then on his Facebook, I feel like he’s totally let us down,” Emslie said. “He’s not listening to the base at all and he just sort of spouts these meaningless platitudes and it sounds so similar to what [Justin] Trudeau is saying.” Emslie, like many at the Mississauga event, chalked his slide to “the COVID situation”. Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie would not comment directly on Bernier’s visit when asked about it at her weekly press conference. “You know I am no fan of divisive rhetoric or some of the anti-vaccine messages that are being [spread] so I hope they keep their messaging to fact and science,” she said. The appeal of the PPC in an area like Mississauga or Brampton is surprising. The party is decisively anti-immigration — planning to reduce Canada’s immigration levels from more than 400,000 this year to a maximum of 150,000 — yet some of its Peel candidates come from immigrant backgrounds themselves. The party stance on COVID-19, masks and lockdown policies also flies in the face of Peel’s brutal experience with the pandemic, as essential workers and many other residents have suffered from some of the highest rates of transmission in the country throughout much of the ongoing pandemic. At Thursday’s event, in another bizarre episode, to prove the PPC is an inclusive party that could legitimately reflect the values of one of the world’s most diverse regions, one speaker asked the crowd to cheer based on their place of origin. Supporters erupted to the call for those of European descent, with a scattering of shouts for China and India, followed by silence when the speaker called out for supporters with Indigenous roots. The event was not exclusively white but the vast majority of attendees did not reflect the majority visible minority population of Mississauga and Peel, where almost two thirds of residents are not white, according to the 2016 Census. Balgord says COVID-19 conspiracy theories and the far right go hand-in-hand, with a range of anti-establishment conspiracy theories being co-opted to recruit and expand movements like the PPC. Activists frequent corners of the internet where conspiracies breed, drawing anti-vaccine supporters and others who push an anti-establishment narrative, while a mix of racist messaging blends in with their ideology, he said. “They grab onto new issues and add new grievances and that means they suck in people who don’t fully realize it’s a racist movement and have a chance to radicalize them,” he said. “They bring a bunch of people who are right-wing minded, but they aren’t raving racists or anything, and then they feed them a bunch of racism and conspiracy theories and those people become a part of the far-right.” Email: isaac.callan@thepointer.com"

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 20 ... What we are watching in Canada ... Canada's first-ever pandemic election culminates today as Canadians from coast-to-coast go to the polls to choose the 338 members of Parliament to sit in the House of Commons. Elections Canada says almost 6.8 million people voted early, most of them at advanced polls over a week ago, and the rest through special ballots cast by mail or at Elections Canada offices. However, a majority of Canada's more than 30 million eligible voters will mark their ballots today. Elections Canada encourages voters to wear masks but only requires them in places where they are mandated by provincial rules. Proof-of-vaccination regulations do not apply at polling stations in any province where they currently exist. Polling stations are open for 12 hours, though opening times vary by region, starting as early as 7 a.m. PST in British Columbia and as late as 9:30 a.m. EDT in Ontario and most of Quebec. Most riding winners will be known by the end of the evening, but Elections Canada is warning it could take up to four days to finish counting all the special ballots, meaning some close races may not have official winners for several days. --- Also this ... OTTAWA — Dozens of female Afghan students have escaped the Taliban with the help of a Toronto-based charity and are heading to Saskatoon after a daring land journey lasting weeks. Nearly 100 girls have managed to flee to Pakistan with their families after failing to get out of Kabul before the airport was closed. A number of Afghan female dancers were also part of the group. They will head to Saskatoon within the next three weeks, Canada's immigration minister confirmed on Sunday. The group of about 200 Afghans spent weeks trying to find a safe route to evade the Taliban, which recently reclaimed political control of the country and opposes the education of women. Prince’s Trust Canada, which is a charity set up by Prince Charles that supports youth and veterans programs and was involved in co-ordinating the escape, said it was relieved the group had finally made it to safety. “They are a highly inspiring community and now they have an opportunity to grow and continue their education in Canada,” said charity chairman Mark Fell. With support from the youth charity, the girls tried to escape by air after the Taliban seized control of the country last month. But conditions proved too perilous to allow the girls and their relatives to reach the Kabul airport. They then tried to make it to another Afghan airport and considered fleeing over the border with Uzbekistan before ultimately escaping to Pakistan. The federal government confirmed on Sunday that it plans to resettle the female students and their families in Saskatoon. They are expected to travel there within two or three weeks, and will quarantine after their arrival in Canada in accordance with federal measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. Last month the federal government announced it would resettle 20,000 Afghans who had fled their country. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... DEL RIO, Texas — The U.S. is flying Haitians camped in a Texas border town back to their homeland and trying to block others from crossing the border from Mexico. It's a massive show of force that signals the beginning of what could be one of America’s swiftest, large-scale expulsions of migrants or refugees in decades. Three flights with 145 passengers each arrived in Port-au-Prince, and Haiti said six flights were expected on Tuesday. In all, U.S. authorities moved to expel many of the more 12,000 migrants camped around a bridge in Del Rio, Texas, after crossing from Mexico. --- Also this ... Authorities are continuing to look for a Florida man following the apparent discovery of his girlfriend's body in Wyoming after she went missing on a cross country trip. An FBI agent says the body discovered Sunday is believed to be Gabrielle “Gabby” Petito. The cause of death not yet been determined. Petito and her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, left in July on a cross-country trek in a converted van to visit national parks in the U.S. West. Police said Laundrie was alone when he drove the van back to Florida, on Sept. 1. He's been named a person of interest in the case. The search for him concentrated over the weekend on a vast wildlife area near Florida's Gulf Coast. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... MOSCOW — A gunman opened fire in a university in the Russian city of Perm this morning, leaving eight people dead and others wounded, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee. The gunman has been detained, the Interior Ministry said. The Perm State University press service said the perpetrator used a so-called “traumatic” firearm; such guns are designed to fire non-lethal rubber or plastic projectiles, but can be modified to fire other ammunition. Students and staff of the university locked themselves in rooms, and the university urged those who could leave the campus to do so. The state Tass news agency cited an unnamed source in the law enforcement as saying that some students jumped out of the windows of a building. --- Also this ... LOS LLANOS DE ARIDANE — Lava continues to flow slowly from a volcano that erupted in Spain’s Canary Islands off northwest Africa. The head of the islands' regional government said today that he expects no injuries to people in the area after some 5,000 were evacuated. Lava is flowing on the island of La Palma toward the sea, moving at about 700 metres per hour. Officials say the lava is moving in two streams through a mostly unpopulated area but has destroyed some 20 isolated houses. Officials say they are not expecting any other eruption and no lives are currently in danger. La Palma has a population of 85,000. --- And this ... SEOUL — North Korea is criticizing a U.S. decision to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia and threatened unspecified countermeasures if it finds the deal affects its security. State media today published comments from an unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry official who called the arrangement between U.S., Britain and Australia an “extremely"" dangerous act that would destroy the security balance in the Asia-Pacific. The official said it would trigger a nuclear arms race. U.S. President Joe Biden revealed last week a new alliance including Australia and Britain that would include an Australian fleet of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Biden stressed the vessels would be conventionally armed. --- In entertainment ... LOS ANGELES — Netflix’s “The Crown” and “The Queen’s Gambit” combined with Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso” to sweep top series honors at the Sunday’s Emmy Awards, a first for streaming services that cemented their rise to prominence in the television industry. ""I’m at a loss for words,” said Peter Morgan, the creator and writer of the British royal saga “The Crown,” which collected acting, writing and directing awards in addition to four acting honors. His comment may also apply to the premium cable channels that once ruled the Emmy Awards and to the broadcast networks — including Sunday's ceremony host, CBS — that have long grown accustomed to being largely also-rans. Netflix won a leading total of 44 awards, equaling the broadcast network record set back in 1974, by CBS. The streaming service, which fielded the first drama series nominee, “House of Cards” in 2007, finally won the category. Newcomer Apple TV+'s first top series came less than two years after it launched. “The Crown” and “The Queen's Gambit” tied as leaders with 11 awards each, with “Ted Lasso” topping the comedy side with seven trophies. The ceremony proved disappointing to those scrutinizing diversity in Hollywood. The record number of nominees of colour yielded only two Black winners, including RuPaul for “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and star-creator Michaela Coel's writing award for “I May Destroy You.” Cedric the Entertainer proved a game host, moving from a hip-hop opening number to gags and sketches, but the relatively small crowd — a result of pandemic precautions — was fairly muted in their response to him and others' one-liners. Among the lost stars remembered during the show was Canadian comedian Norm Macdonald. John Oliver of “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” paid tribute. “No one was funnier in the last 20 years than Norm Macdonald on late-night comedy,"" Oliver said in accepting the Emmy for best variety talk show, suggesting people spend time checking out clips of Macdonald, as he did after Macdonald died Sept. 14 at age 61. --- ICYMI ... TORONTO — British star Kenneth Branagh's ""deeply personal"" directorial effort, ""Belfast,"" picked up some awards season momentum after winning the People's Choice prize at the Toronto International Film Festival. The family drama inspired by his own childhood in Belfast, Ireland won the honour during Saturday's TIFF Tribute Awards broadcast on CTV, which ended 10 days of pandemic-tailored in-person screenings and digital at-home viewing. Caitríona Balfe, Jamie Dornan and Judi Dench star in the black-and-white coming-of-age tale, set amid the tumult of late-1960s Northern Ireland. Branagh, who's also an esteemed actor with an Oscar-nominated turn in ""Henry V,"" said he was ""deeply grateful"" for the prize chosen through online votes. The People's Choice prize has been seen as a predictor of Academy Award success. The first runner-up was Canadian drama ""Scarborough,"" directed by Shasha Nakhai and Rich Williamson and based on Toronto author Catherine Hernandez’s award-winning 2017 novel about the city's eastern suburb. The film also took the Shawn Mendes Foundation's Changemaker Award, which comes with a $10,000 cash prize. This year's festival marked a return to red carpets with stars, more indoor venues and a larger offering of films than last year's largely digital event. It still wasn't a typical TIFF, though, with theatres operating at 50 per cent capacity and COVID-19 protocols including mask-wearing and proof of either full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 20, 2021 Subject: Students; Emmy awards; COVID-19; Airports; Pandemics; Streaming media; Firearms"

Elections Canada says almost 6.8-million people voted early, most of them at advanced polls over a week ago, and the rest through special ballots cast by mail or at Elections Canada offices. But a majority of Canada's more than 30-million eligible voters will mark their ballots today.

The authority, which covers the northern half of B-C, says it's facing a severe nursing shortage in a northern city as staff face criticism from protesters about public-health measures and vaccines. The Northern Health Authority says of 20 permanent registered nursing jobs on its emergency room rotationg, only five positions are filled. It means other nurses are being diverted to the shift, placing further stress on other rotations. Northern Health adds staff are ""exhausted, overworked, and are facing brutal criticism from the public and insults on their shifts.''

A much smaller crowd was seated within a big tent in downtown Los Angeles. And many overseas nominees couldn't come due to travel restrictions -- especially the cast and crew of ""The Crown,'' which accepted its awards from a party in London, as ""Schitt's Creek"" had done a year earlier in Canada. Best acting in a drama series went to ""The Crown's"" Olivia Colman who plays Queen Elizabeth and Josh O'Connor for his role as Prince Charles. Acting winners for comedy were Jason Sudeikis, star and co-creator of ""Ted Lasso,"" and Jean Smart of ""Hacks.""

But some residents were quick to claim they could easily edit the document. Calgary's Dan Shugar says the card was in a PDF file which he was able to edit to say his name was ""Fakus McFakeFace."" Alberta's United Conservative government announced the availability of the cards before its ""restrictions exemption program'' launches today. The program allows businesses and venues to operate without capacity limits and other measures if they require patrons' proof of vaccination or a negative test result.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Parliament Audio 4:25 AM ET P05 – (FedElxn-Conservatives) LONDON, Ont. x–09s. Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole may be feeling some heat from the fledgling People’s Party of Canada as Canadians vote today in the federal election. O’Toole is urging “frustrated” voters to choose his party over the smaller ones if they want to send a message to the Trudeau Liberals. O’Toole refused to reference the People’s Party of Canada, led by former Conservative M-P Maxime Bernier, when he made his remarks Friday in London, Ontario. (“..Canada’s Conservatives.”) (SOURCE:The Canadian Press) TAG: The P-P-C has seen a noticeable uptick in popular support in the final days of the campaign, with political watchers saying the party could steal away some Conservative votes in today’s election."
"2021-09-22","Full text: ---- (FedElxn-Campaign)(Audio:P06) Canada's federal political leaders and candidates will stump for votes today for the last time in this 36-day election campaign. Today is election day. Polling stations are open for 12 hours, but the opening times vary by region, starting as early as 7 a.m. PST in British Columbia and as late as 9:30 a.m. EDT in Ontario and most of Quebec. Most riding winners will be known by the end of the evening, but Elections Canada is also warning it could take up to four days to finish counting all the special ballots -- meaning any close races may not be declared tonight. (4) --- (FedElxn-PPC)(Audio:P05) Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole isn't coasting through this pandemic-era campaign. Jack Jedwab, president of the Association of Canadian Studies, says trying to lure in soft Liberal voters from the left, without losing the anti-vaccine-passport, anti-mask cohort to the People's Party of Canada on the right, has made O'Toole's path to power much more challenging. The P-P-C under leader Maxime Bernier -- a former Conservative M-P -- secured less than two per cent support during the 2019 federal election. But most national polls recently had them in the range of five to eight per cent -- possibly enough to spoil Conservative chances in close ridings. (4) --- (COVID-Alta-Restrictions) Alberta's version of a vaccine passport system launches today. The province's ""restrictions exemption program"" allows certain businesses and venues to skip capacity limits and other public-health measures if they require all people entering to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative test result. Premier Jason Kenney has said the action became necessary to protect Alberta's hospitals from being overwhelmed in the pandemic's fourth wave.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Today in History - Sept. 20 Today in History for Sept. 20: In 1378, the ""Great Schism"" in the Roman Catholic Church began. It was touched off when Pope Gregory XI died, shortly after returning the papal seat from Avignon, in France, to Rome. Continuing for nearly 40 years, until 1417, the schism at one point produced three concurrent popes. In 1519, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan began his voyage to circumnavigate the globe. Magellan was killed en route, but one of his ships eventually circled the world. In 1697, the ""Treaty of Ryswick"" was signed. France returned Hudson Bay and Newfoundland to Britain, in return for Acadia. In 1816, stage coach service started between Toronto and Niagara. In 1842, chemist and physicist James Dewar was born in Scotland. In 1892, he invented a double-walled glass vessel to keep gases and chemicals cold. One of his ex-students, Reinhold Burger, patented and began making the ""Thermos"" vacuum flask for domestic use in 1904. In 1857, Delhi, India, fell to the British after a long siege. In 1867, the first general election in Canada, won by the Conservatives under Sir John A. Macdonald, was completed. Confederation, achieved earlier in the year, had set out the mandate for the formation of a federal government to unite the four provinces in the Dominion at the time. Macdonald formed a coalition cabinet almost equally split between Liberal and Conservative ministers and representing different regions, religions and cultures. In 1870, Italian troops took control of the Papal States, leading to the unification of Italy. In 1873, the New York Stock Exchange was forced to close for the first time because of a banking crisis. In 1917, the Wartime Elections Act was passed, giving the vote to some Canadian women and disenfranchising many citizens born in enemy countries. The act gave wives, mothers and sisters of men in the armed service the right to vote. In May 1918, all women gained the vote. In 1917, the ""Income Tax War Act"" was enacted as a temporary measure to raise funds for Canada's troops during the First World War. The tax rate for individuals was four per cent, with an additional two per cent on incomes between $6,000 and $10,000. Corporations also paid a four-per-cent rate on incomes over $3,000. In 1931, sterling was taken off the gold standard index. In 1932, Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi began a fast to dramatize his campaign for an end to discrimination against the lowest social class in India, known as the untouchables. Gandhi's fast ended six days later when the ""Pact of Poona"" was passed, allowing the untouchables entrance to all temples and schools and the use of all Indian roads. In 1935, New Brunswick premier A.A. Dysart announced old-age pensions in the province. In 1958, civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. was seriously wounded during a book signing at a New York City department store when a black woman, Izola Curry, stabbed him in the chest. (Curry was later found mentally incompetent.) In 1962, a mine was opened at the world's largest known potash reserves at Esterhazy, Sask. In 1972, letter bombs intended for the Israeli Embassy in Ottawa and the Israeli Consulate in Montreal were discovered. In Montreal, a police bomb squad defused a letter bomb in a city park after removing it from the consulate. In Ottawa, police found explosives in one of six envelopes arriving from Amsterdam. The Arab guerrilla group Black September was believed responsible for the bombs mailed to more than 20 cities around the world. An Israeli official in London, England, was killed Sept. 19 after opening a booby-trapped letter. In 1973, in their so-called Battle of the Sexes, tennis player Billie Jean King defeated Bobby Riggs in straight sets (6-4, 6-3, 6-3) at the Houston Astrodome. In 1977, Canada and the United States agreed to construct a pipeline to carry natural gas from Alaska through Canada to the United States. Parliament approved legislation for construction in April 1978 but the pipeline was never built. In 1981, the British colony of Belize in Central America became independent. In 1982, the National Football League Players' Association called a strike which wiped out most of the season. In 1984, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut was attacked by a suicide bomber who drove into the compound with a truckload of explosives and set them off, killing 40 people. In 1987, Pope John Paul visited Fort Simpson, N.W.T. -- fulfilling a promise he made three years earlier when heavy fog prevented his plane from landing. In 1989, a bomb exploded aboard a French airliner, killing all 170 people aboard as it flew over the Sahara Desert. In 1989, F.W. de Klerk was sworn in as president of South Africa. In 1995, AT&T Corp. announced plans to split itself into three separate companies and said it would quit the personal computer business. In 1999, Sears Canada announced it would buy the outstanding common shares of the insolvent Eaton's in a move that provided up to $50 million for creditors and saved about 1,000 jobs. Sears also took over Eaton's name and trademarks along with eight stores plus options on five other locations. In 2004, ex-general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won an overwhelming victory against incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in Indonesia’s first direct presidential election. In 2004, Quebec’s Liberal government lost three out of four byelections in Montreal. The PQ won Laurier-Dorion, held by Liberals for more than 23 years and easily won the Montreal PQ stronghold of Gouin. The ADQ won Vanier while Liberals won handily in Nelligan, where its candidate Yolande James, 26, became the first black woman elected into the National Assembly. In 2004, nearly 3,000 people died in Haiti after tropical storm Jeanne turned into a hurricane. In 2005, Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal died in Vienna at age 96. In 2005, David Radler, Conrad Black’s newspaper holding company’s ex-chief operating officer, agreed to a jail term and a US$250,000 fine in a deal with the U.S. Attorney for pleading guilty to one count of mail fraud in a scheme to pilfer more than US$32 million from Hollinger International Inc. In 2006, the House of Commons unanimously apologized to Maher Arar for Canada's involvement in his deportation from the United States to Syria, where he was tortured for a year before he was released. In 2006, Iranian-American telecommunications entrepreneur Anousheh Ansari arrived at the International Space Station by Soyuz spacecraft -- becoming the first female space tourist. Ansari paid a reported US$20 million for the trip. In 2007, Tour de France champion Floyd Landis lost his expensive and explosive case when two of three arbitrators upheld the results of a test that showed he had used synthetic testosterone to fuel his spectacular comeback victory. Landis forfeited his Tour title and was subject to a two-year ban, retroactive to Jan. 30, 2007. In 2007, boosted by high commodity prices and a weakening U.S. dollar, the loonie reached parity with the greenback for the first time in nearly 31 years. In 2008, Doug Flutie, Mike ""Pinball"" Clemons, Mike Pringle, John Bonk and Tom Shepherd were inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. In 2008, a powerful truck bomb blast just outside the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad killed 53 people and wounded 270 more. Among those killed was the Czech ambassador to Pakistan and two U.S. Department of Defence officials. In 2011, sweeping changes to Canada's criminal-justice regime were tabled in the House of Commons as part of an 110-page omnibus Conservative crime bill, including nine bills incorporating changes to drug laws, youth sentencing, detention of refugees, parole and house arrest and anti-terrorism measures. Critics said new minimum-sentence provisions would boost the need for costly new prisons and would not deter crime. The Safe Streets and Communities Act passed in the Commons on Dec. 5 by a vote of 157 to 127. In 2011, MTS Centre fans screamed ""Go Jets Go"" as a 15-year separation between Winnipeg and NHL hockey was put on ice as the Jets made their return with a 6-1 exhibition win against the Columbus Blue Jackets. In 2011, after years of debate and months of final preparations, the repeal of the U.S. military's 18-year ban on gays serving openly in uniform took effect. In 2011, an insurgent with a bomb wrapped in his turban assassinated former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was leading a government effort to broker peace with the Taliban. In 2013, smartphone maker BlackBerry announced a 40 per cent cut in its workforce, or 4,500 jobs, as phone sales faltered and the company projecting nearly a billion-dollar quarterly loss. In 2018, The House of Commons unanimously adopted a motion to recognize the crimes committed against Rohingya by the Myanmar military as a genocide. In 2018, The World Anti-Doping Agency reinstated Russia, ending a nearly three-year suspension of the country's drug-testing program because of a state-sponsored doping scheme. WADA said the reinstatement was subject to strict conditions but the head of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport said the agency was effectively thumbing its nose at clean athletes. In 2018, The Canadian Armed Forces said it was re-opening nearly two-dozen cases of alleged sexual assault after reviewing dozens of files previously dismissed by military police as ""unfounded."" The move came nearly 18 months after authorities revealed that nearly one in every three sexual assault complaints logged with military police between 2010 and 2016 was deemed unfounded. In 2020, the Toronto International Film Festival named the winner of this year's People's Choice award. The honour went to ""Nomadland,'' a recession-era road trip drama starring Frances McDormand that tells the story of a woman travelling the American West alone in her van. Filmmaker Michelle Latimer had a double win for her documentary ""Inconvenient Indian."" The adaptation of Thomas King's non-fiction book picked up the People's Choice Documentary Award, as well an Amplify Voices Award. Latimer said she planned to divide the $10,000 cash prize between five emerging Indigenous artists. In 2020, a woman suspected of sending an envelope containing ricin, addressed to White House, was arrested at a Canadian border crossing with New York state. Officials said the woman was taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In 2020, ''Schitt's Creek'' — the Canadian sitcom about a rich family left with nothing but a small town — swept the comedy categories at the Emmy Awards, winning seven trophies for its sixth and final season. Eugene Levy won best actor, Catherine O'Hara won best actress, Annie Murphy won best supporting actress, and Levy's son, Dan Levy, claimed three awards: for best supporting actor, writing and directing."

"2021-09-22","Full text: Legault delivers nationalist speech at convention MONTREAL - Quebec Premier François Legault delivered a nationalist speech to his party's youth wing on Sunday, capping off a weekend-long convention where he touted cohesion in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""This is not the time in Quebec to divide,"" Legault said. ""It's time to defend our social cohesion."" Legault told the Coalition Avenir Quebec convention in the provincial capital that he sees the party as a fortress against the more radical elements of society, including those who oppose COVID-19 health measures and vaccines. He answered his party members' questions during the event, but refused to speak to media on site. Legault told party members that voters who elected the Coalition Avenir Quebec in 2018 voted for a nationalist party that would defend the province's French language and values. ""We are the party in Quebec who stands up for our nation,"" Legault said, adding that his party would be the nationalist party in the upcoming provincial election in 2022. The premier has faced backlash recently from critics who accused him of telling Quebecers who to vote for in Monday's federal election, after he called the Liberals ""dangerous"" for Quebec and strongly suggested he would prefer a Conservative minority government. Legault said his intention was not to tell Quebecers who to vote for, but said he wants Quebec to have more autonomy and power after describing himself as a nationalist. He asked young party members to consider the fact that, according to him, three parties — the Liberals, New Democrats and Greens — would interfere in matters that fall under provincial purview. ""They want to interfere in our jurisdiction,"" Legault said. Ahead of Monday's election, Legault said the federal parties have ""bragged about intervening in a very important jurisdiction, health, which he said should be Quebec's responsibility."" He denounced the willingness of ""certain parties"" to offer Quebec money with conditions. ""The federal government must contribute to health care,"" Legault said, asking for an additional $6 billion annually to meet his province's needs. ""What Quebec needs is not more officials in Ottawa, but more nurses in Quebec."" The youth convention's theme centred on pride in being a Quebecer. Party members took positions in favour of the creation of a museum on Quebec's national history and the enhancement of heritage buildings. They also advocated for the development of a syllabus on Quebec literature, more mental health services for young people and better treatment of municipal wastewater.

"2021-09-21","Full text: COVID-19 influencing votes, poll suggests OTTAWA - The federal election campaign entered its final hours on Sunday with party leaders making last-minute appeals in whirlwind tours of swing ridings, all while still trying to convince voters to buy into their version of what this vote is all about. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, who is hopping around seven ridings in the metro Vancouver region, and Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, who is spending his final campaign day in the Greater Toronto Area, both want this vote to be a referendum on the leadership of their chief rival, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. Trudeau, following a punishing cross-country Sunday schedule with in-person and virtual events in every province but Saskatchewan, wants it to be about who Canadians trust the most to lead them out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jack Jedwab, president of the Association of Canadian Studies, said the election has not been as much about the pandemic response as Trudeau likely had hoped. ""Ideally for the Liberal standpoint, what should have been the key determining issue in the election is 'are you satisfied with their handling of COVID,"" Jedwab said in an interview. ""The objective would have been to try to align the satisfaction rates with voter choices, but that isn't what happened."" Instead, he said, the pandemic became just one of five or six issues voters are considering when deciding how to cast their ballots, including child care, the environment, Afghanistan and guns. A new poll for Jedwab's organization, conducted by Leger, found while 60 per cent of respondents are satisfied with how the federal government handled the pandemic, just 40 per cent are letting that opinion influence their vote. Jedwab said that's down from 48 per cent who said at the end of August that the pandemic response was affecting their choice. The most recent poll was conducted for the association between Sept. 10 and 12, but can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls aren't considered random samples. The typical voter malaise that accompanies any early election call has not evaporated in this campaign, a fact O'Toole references multiple times in every speech, when he talks about an ""unnecessary $600 million election in the middle of a pandemic."" COVID-19 has come back to the fore in the campaign's final days, particularly as the fourth wave in Alberta forced that province to resurrect health measures like public masking and introduce a vaccine passport system that Premier Jason Kenney had promised would never come to be. The Leger poll suggests people in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and British Columbia are overwhelmingly happy with how their provinces managed the pandemic. But in Ontario and the prairies, where all governments are conservative, enthusiasm for the provincial response is barely tepid. In Alberta, for instance, only 28 per cent said they were satisfied with the province's handling of the pandemic compared with 48 per cent who said they were content with the federal response. Trudeau has worked hard to tie O'Toole to the conservative premiers in those provinces. Jedwab said the Kenney factor could swing some seats in Calgary and Edmonton towards the Liberals, but will likely hurt the Conservatives most in Ontario and British Columbia. Vaccine passports, a subject Trudeau has pushed hard throughout the campaign, became a rock-and-hard place issue for O'Toole, said Jedwab. He noted that while a large majority of Canadians like the idea of them, a sizable chunk of O""Toole's base does not. Trying to lure in soft Liberal voters from the left, without losing the anti-vaccine-passport, anti-mask cohort to the People's Party of Canada on the right, has made O'Toole's path to power much more challenging. The PPC and leader Maxime Bernier secured less than two per cent support during the 2019 federal election, but most national polls currently have them in the range of five to eight per cent. It's not enough to win a lot of seats — though Bernier has a fighting chance to win his riding near Quebec City — but it's possibly enough to spoil Conservative chances in close ridings in southern Ontario in particular. Polls open at 9:30 a.m. Monday, and in normal times the results would be all but guaranteed before the clock strikes midnight, But these are not normal times. Elections Canada warned Sunday there are nearly a million special ballots to be tallied and it might be four days before they're all counted. Elections Canada spokeswoman Natasha Gauthier said in an email Sunday that officials will start counting special ballots on Tuesday morning. They need a two-step verification process to ensure people haven't also voted in person, and Gauthier said in most cases the counting will be done Wednesday, but it's possible it could take up to four days ""due to high volumes or logistical challenges.""

However the imams say when Cotter met with local Muslim leaders on September 15th, he repeated his apology but ""refused to say anything else"" in answer to questions about what he would do to address Islamophobia. The imams say they can only interpret Cotter's silence as a refusal to reflect and learn as he promised to do in his apology.

Lots of people smiling and lots of people from out of town. I had lots of very good comments. The Shriners couldn’t get over how good Lumsden was.” He said the parade was great and suggested the town send a note to the Derby committee thanking them for their work. Council agreed and made motioned to do so. The town’s webpage also noted their commendations on the excellent work on the Duck Derby. Councillor Barber reported that Todd Wilson hosted the Cindy Wilson memorial golf tournament on the Saturday of the Duck Derby. Barber said the event was a resounding success that generated nearly $2000 and donated to the Cindy Wilson Fund at Lumsden Elementary School. He said, “For those of us that knew Cindy and knew her well it’s a really nice way to honour her.” He said for those that didn’t know, Cindy was a long-time teacher at Lumsden Elementary School. He said many of her former students participate in the golf tournament, which has become a very nice event. Councillor Rhonda Phillips said the Grand Opening for the Wastewater Treatment Plant was postponed until October 15th due to the Federal Election. She said this was because they couldn’t advertise that they received funding from the Federal Government during an election. Councillor Jenelle Brennan reported the rink has been operational since July 31st, with ice times quickly filling up for the season. She said the rink had received a liquor license, and attendees can now purchase drinks at the canteen. The rink is also offering skate sharpening, and the board is looking for more board members. The AGM is scheduled for Tuesday, September 21st. Council discussed the new federal statutory holiday on September 30th for Truth and Reconciliation. Chief Administrative Officer Monica Merkosky noted that anyone not federally regulated does not have to observe the holiday; however, the City of Regina is. She said the municipal office was planning on working that day. Merkosky said she was not sure what the Province was planning on doing but noted she had not received any notification of any new information. Councillor Byron Tumbach noted that some collective agreements include language that if there is a new national holiday, the employees covered under the agreement would also receive the day off regardless of their Province of residence. He said that they see these agreements in some of the care home has in place. CAO Merkosky noted that a totem pole in town was evaluated for some restoration work. Because it was determined the pole wasn’t going to last in its location, the town moved it to the museum, where it would be rehabilitated. Merkosky noted there might be an opportunity with the help of some truth and reconciliation funding to move the totem pole to another location in the community. The Zoom link address is now on the town’s website with the list of agendas. It was noted that the link doesn’t change, and members of the public who want to view the meeting can access it at their convenience. The Town of Lumsden received $109,531.20 from the Canada Community-Building Funds, formerly the ‘Gas Tax.’ Those funds will be placed into the Town’s Utility Reserve. Merkosky noted that the RM Council agrees with Councillor Verne Barber that the joint administration committee should meet more regularly. The next meeting will be in November to discuss the Fire Department and Library Budget and joint administration staffing for 2022. Mayor Bryan Matheson started the forum and provided some information to the Council on the Mayor’s Summer School he attended. Matheson said the conference was very good, with 58 Municipal Mayors in attendance. He commended the big city mayors in attendance because it showed unity in SUMA and that issues that can be big or small are the same for both larger and smaller municipalities. The Mayor recommended that the Council should meet three times over the summer in 2022 instead of 2. The additional meeting would mean that decisions on town business would be more timely. Merkosky said direction had been given to have three meetings booked in when the schedule is made. Council discussed the Development Levy Bylaw.

"2021-09-21","Full text: COVID-19 pandemic tinges debate in home stretch OTTAWA - The fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic coloured some heated political debate Saturday in the final stretch of the federal election campaign. Justin Trudeau touted the importance of getting vaccinated as key to a safer future, while the NDP's Jagmeet Singh criticized the Liberal leader for failing to push harder for paid sick leave and proof-of-vaccination certificates. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, meanwhile, insisted his party was running a safe campaign but would not say how many of his candidates are fully immunized against the virus. O'Toole has repeatedly taken Trudeau to task for calling an election during the pandemic. ""I will not use a health crisis to divide Canadians as Mr. Trudeau has with this election,"" the Conservative leader said during a swing through southern Ontario. O'Toole tried to cast the debate forward, citing a need to be ready for the possibility of another pandemic. He pointed to the Tory platform, which includes promises to ramp up domestic vaccine research, trials and manufacturing capacity as well as domestic production of critical supplies and better means of detecting and assessing health-related threats. The goal is ""to be more prepared for a pandemic, to not be relying on others, to rely on ourself,"" O'Toole said. Campaigning north of Toronto, Trudeau accused O'Toole of telling his party's candidates to hide their vaccination status. The question of who Canadians trust to get through the pandemic is a core one for voters, because everyone wants to see the end of COVID-19, he said. ""We are seeing a fourth wave. It is concentrated amongst unvaccinated people — it is concentrated, actually, in those conservative western provinces that didn't move forward as strongly on vaccination as other parts of the country,"" Trudeau said. ""The reality is Canadians deserve to make a clear choice."" Voters head to the polls on Monday, though many have already cast ballots in advance polls or through the mail. Opinion polls generally place the Liberals and Conservatives in a deadlock, with notable leads for Trudeau's party in vote-rich Ontario and Quebec. Singh seemed unfazed Saturday when asked about his party's lack of movement in the polls, seemingly stalled in third place. ""Canadians are going to decide what type of Parliament we have on Monday, and that's going to be their choice,"" Singh said in Saskatoon. ""I've been hearing from so many people that have been saying, I can't vote for the Liberals again, I can't pay the price of their broken promises."" Looking to a pandemic recovery, Singh stressed the importance of ensuring people don't have to go to work when they are ill. ""We know that many times in this pandemic, people were going into work sick, and that workplace transmission of the virus is one of the highest sources of transmission. We want to make sure people don't have to do that anymore."" The NDP want to continue supports for small businesses and ""make sure that big box stores and large corporations start paying their fair share to invest that back into people,"" he added. Singh also emphasized the New Democrats' promise to end privatized long-term care. ""We have a plan to make sure people are at the heart of our solutions and that health care is something we invest in."" Green Leader Annamie Paul, campaigning in British Columbia, called for greater co-operation across levels of government and political parties to combat the virus. ""We need clear information so that people can can go about their lives knowing that they're doing their fair share to help us to defeat COVID once and for all,"" Paul said. ""And we also need a much more vigorous education campaign for those who continue to hesitate to get vaccinated.""

"2021-09-20","Full text: The Village of Morrin council approved extra funding for certain water infrastructure projects as costs unexpectedly grew. The decision was made at the Sept. 15 regular meeting of council. Village Official Administrator (OA) Harold Johnsrude read a financial update regarding capital projects. Johnsrude stated there were two parts to the report. The first was the water plant’s pump project which he reported was over budget plus the truck fill upgrade, which also went over budget. The total extra cost was $6,331 for these two projects stated Johnsrude. The OA noted stimulus grants were applied to these projects and the village had budgeted just over $5,000 but more money would have to be found. Secondly, Johnsrude reported on four Morrin residences that had sewer lateral lines repaired. The OA reported funding for these repairs was coming from the water/sewer restricted surplus account for a budget of $20,000. However, it was reported the laterals for the four residences ended up costing about $32,000, with Public Works foreman Dave Benci reporting that hydrovac services increased the cost but had the advantage of protecting the sidewalk, along with what Johnsrude referred to as “investigational” costs. Johnsrude noted this amounted to a roughly 50 per cent increase from budget, and would also require transfer of funds from the surplus account. He made and passed a motion to transfer funds from the water/sewer restricted surplus account to cover the extra costs for the projects mentioned above. Public Works report As Benci was absent from the meeting, Village Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Annette Plachner presented the foreman’s regular report. The report stated repairs to the water leak in the plant were completed, fire hydrant repair was completed Sept. 15 and the emergency pump upgrade project will begin soon and is expected to be done by the end of the year. Johnsrude noted the fire hydrant repair project was the final outstanding item left to be addressed from the previous council. Bank transfer Johnsrude made and passed a motion giving the CAO authority to transfer funds between the village bank accounts with her signature. It was mentioned beforehand that the village auditor suggested reducing the number of bank accounts the village uses as well. The OA noted the village had seven bank accounts, many of which were unused. This was streamlined to two, as six of them were combined into one account called “deferred revenue” for grants. Johnsrude added that the bank required a council resolution for the CAO’s transfer authority. OA report Johnsrude noted in a brief regular report that he anticipated a full council being sworn in after the upcoming municipal election, meaning his term guiding the Village of Morrin would be soon at an end. He noted, however, he would be attending the first council meeting, the organizational meeting, after the election in October. Election candidates CAO Plachner noted after the meeting four candidates have filed papers to run for the three Village of Morrin council seats in the October election. Plachner added that other nomination packages had gone out but hadn’t been returned, so it was possible there could be more candidates. Subject: Local elections; Bank accounts; Councils; Costs"

"2021-09-20","Full text: Riding to watch: Gaspésie-Iles-de-la-Madeleine The Gaspésie region in eastern Quebec is best known to outsiders for its charming villages, outdoor recreation opportunities and panoramic views of the St. Lawrence River, but it could also become contested territory on election day. The Gaspesie-Les Iles-de-la-Madeleine riding narrowly remained Liberal in 2019, with Diane Lebouthillier defeating her Bloc Québécois rival by fewer than 700 votes. In just over a decade, the mostly rural riding in the east of the province has been held by the Bloc, the NDP and the Liberals. As a mark of its importance, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau travelled to the riding in July to make a campaign-style announcement of $25 million to expand a wind turbine plant to produce blades destined for markets in the United States and Europe. Throughout the day Lebouthillier was by his side, walking with him along Percé’s picturesque boardwalk for a photo, introducing him to local people and taking over the mic from Trudeau at a news conference when questions came on local issues. In an interview in July, the 62-year-old Lebouthillier was unequivocally confident in her chances of winning a third term, despite the closeness of the vote last time. The outgoing federal revenue minister said close elections are normal in a riding with such a low population, noting that she’d won her first election — as Reeve of her regional county municipality — by a single vote. “I’m going to win the next election and I’m going to win it with Madelinots and I’m going to win it with Gaspésiens because they want to continue seeing themselves represented in Ottawa,” she said Her main challenger is Bloc Québécois candidate Guy Bernatchez, the local mayor and forestry industry executive who she narrowly beat in 2019. Bernatchez said he's better known and prepared the second time around, being more familiar with the process of recruiting volunteers and working the phones. “Certainly, I'll be better, I'll be better known. The Bloc is not coming from so far behind, and has done excellent work since 2019,” he said. Both Lebouthillier and Bernatchez will be expected to address key issues in the riding, which include an aging population, a labour shortage, the need for jobs that go beyond seasonal tourist work or fishing, the threat of climate change-related erosion and need to repair and maintain key infrastructure such as ports. Recently in Gaspé, citizens expressed mixed opinions. Marie-Andree Beauchamp, who works seasonally in the hotel industry, says the return of the Bloc Québécois would be “a dream,” but isn’t sure it will happen. She says the Liberals have made investments in the region, including to fix up Percé’s storm-damaged boardwalk, but feels most of the investments were for tourists, not locals. What locals need, she said, is higher salaries. A seniors home in Gaspé, about a 45-minute drive away, appeared to be friendlier Liberal territory. Several residents sitting out enjoying the sunshine and river views at Residence Foyer de Gaspé all said they would likely vote Liberal. One resident had praise for Lebouthillier, who was described as a straight talker. A guest, who was visiting her mother at the home, praised Trudeau’s handling of the pandemic. “I think he was the only one to really help people,” said Rose-Marie Dorion, as she sat outdoors on a wooden bench. But Dorion, who works part-time with seniors, said she also believes the benefits have gone on long enough, and that people are now reluctant to work. Lebouthillier said the Liberal government has invested heavily in the region and has got results. As an example, she cited Trudeau’s wind power plant announcement as a major investment that will help the region continue to develop as a wind energy power and bring some 200 good-paying jobs to a region where salaries have traditionally been low-paying service and fishing. In contrast to the Liberals, “The Bloc Québécois can only complain,” she said. Bernatchez, for his part, acknowledged that Lebouthillier is well-liked in certain circles, but he also believes citizens are disappointed with the Liberals’ lack of action on certain files, ranging from a failure to increase benefits for younger seniors to not restoring the popular Cap-des-Rosiers Lighthouse, which sits next to Forillon National Park. He rejects Lebouthillier’s argument that the Bloc can’t get anything done because they’ll never be more than an opposition party, noting that the country has several opposition parties that have never formed government. Also running in the riding are Lisa Phung for the New Democrats, Jean-Pierre Pigeon for the Conservatives and Christian Rioux for the People’s party.

"2021-09-20","Full text: Canadians are heading to the polls Monday to vote in the 43rd federal election. Polling stations in the Sudbury and Nickel Belt ridings will be open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Electors should consult their voter information cards to find their designated polling station and bring with them a government-issued piece of ID to prove their identity and current address. COVID-19 safety protocols will be in place at all polling stations across the country, and Elections Canada is reminding voters that they should stay home if they have symptoms of COVID-19. “If anyone is not feeling well, they should get tested for COVID-19 and follow all public health guidelines,” said Rejean Grenier, regional media adviser for Elections Canada. “If they know they have COVID-19, they should be self-isolating, and if they are self-isolating, then they have no other options,” Grenier said the deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot was on Sept. 14 at 6 p.m. “If anyone presents with symptoms between now and Monday, they will have to sit this election out,” he said. Voting kits were mailed to a total of 2,396 people in the Nickel Belt riding and 2,361 people in the Sudbury riding. As of Friday, 1,589 voting kits in the Nickel Belt riding and 1,240 voting kits in the Sudbury riding were returned to Elections Canada. Advanced voting across the country was up 18 per cent compared to last year, said Grenier. A total of 11,802 voters in the Nickel Belt riding and 9,387 voters in the Sudbury riding turned up at advanced polling stations from Sept. 10 to Sept. 13. Voters are reminded to wear a mask or a face covering to the polling station on Monday. “All of our staff will be wearing face coverings, as mandated by the Ontario government. Many of them will be wearing gloves and will be seated behind plexiglass dividers,” said Grenier. “We will also have hand sanitizer available for voters, and staff will be cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces regularly.” Elections Canada will provide single-use pencils, and voters can bring their own pen or pencil to mark their ballot. Everyone is encouraged to practise physical distancing by staying at least two metres or six feet away from other voters and poll workers. Public Health Sudbury and Districts reported a potential low-risk exposure to COVID-19 at a federal polling station in Sudbury on Sept. 10, but Grenier said that’s the only potential exposure he is aware of in this region. “Elections Canada will be following all public health measures to ensure the safety of voters across the country,” said Grenier. To vote, electors should bring their voter information card as well as a piece of government-issued ID to their designated polling station. A driver’s license or another piece of identification that displays a current address will be accepted. Those who do not have a driver’s license (or another piece of ID displaying a current address) can bring one piece of ID to prove their identity and another piece displaying a current address. For example, a voter can bring their voter information card and a bank statement, utility bill, or student ID. Voters should check the Elections Canada website for a full list of accepted documents. If you do not have identification, you can still vote if you declare your identity and address in writing and have someone who knows you and who is assigned to your polling station vouch for you. The voucher must be able to prove their identity and address. A person can vouch for only one person (except in long-term care facilities). For more information visit www.electionscanada.ca.

"2021-09-20","Full text: Voting in federal election a challenge in Nunavut IQALUIT, Nunavut - Nearly 5.8 million Canadians voted in advance polls, says Elections Canada, but residents of nine communities in Nunavut will have to wait until Monday to cast their ballots. And for those out of town, like Cathy Aitaok from Cambridge Bay, casting a ballot by mail was unreliable because of long delivery times at Canada Post. ""Because the documents need to be mailed to me, I won't be here in time to receive them,"" said Aitaok, who had to travel to Edmonton a week before the election to see a family member. Elections Canada says 16 of Nunavut's 25 communities had advance polling last weekend — one more than in the 2019 federal election. ""I don't think that I will be voting this year. It's definitely not easy,"" Aitaok said. A political-science professor says the voting situation in Nunavut is an example of long-standing unequal access to the ballot box for some Canadians. ""We're starting to see that there are some areas where Elections Canada could have done a little bit more in terms of trying to increase access for Canadians in unusual circumstances,"" said Stewart Prest of Simon Fraser University. Elections Canada says 39.6 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot in 2019, the lowest turnout since 2004. Access to polling stations isn't a new problem, Prest said. ""It's been an ongoing challenge for decades."" The COVID-19 pandemic has also meant more people wanted to vote early to avoid lineups and crowds on election day, Prest said. Prest said alternative ways of voting should have been considered long before the pandemic hit. ""Everyone who wants to have a voice should be given the opportunity to cast a ballot. I think this is an area where we can’t accept good enough,"" he said. Some voters in the British Columbia provincial election last year cast their ballots by phone, something Prest said could be an option for more isolated places like Nunavut. ""We're just going to need to try to find more alternatives, more ways to try to make voting accessible to all Canadians."" Diane Benson, a spokeswoman for Elections Canada, said between 200 and 300 people are hired to work at polling stations in Nunavut. Poll workers are paid 20 per cent more because of the high cost of living in the North. Benson said she has heard concerns about mail-in ballots in the territory not being delivered in time. ""We recognize that there are Canada Post service delivery standards up there that may make the deadlines tight,"" she said. Another issue Nunavut voters face is a lack of the Inuktut language on the ballot. Statistics Canada says 65 per cent of the territory's residents speak Inuktut as their mother tongue. Canada's Elections Act requires the ballot to be in English and French, Benson said. ""It is very strictly prescribed in law what the ballot must look like and the ballot must say. We have to follow that,"" said Benson, who added that Elections Canada tries to hire Inuktut speakers to work the polls in Nunavut. Nunavut NDP MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq tabled a private member's bill in June to get Inuktut on the federal election ballot, but it was voted down at committee. Information cards telling voters where to cast their ballots were distributed in English, French and Inuktut, Benson said. Polling stations will have a list of candidates in Inuktut and an Inuktut-speaking interpreter will be available over the phone.

"2021-09-20","Full text: Mayors across Canada are calling on the federal parties to take urgent action on housing and homelessness as voting day fast approaches. In an open letter to the federal parties, 17 mayors from cities across the country — including Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, Halifax, Ottawa, Montreal, Winnipeg, and Edmonton — push the next federal government to use its leadership to deal with the “devastating consequences” of Canada’s underfunded affordable housing and social services. “I'm hoping this letter is a clear signal to federal party leaders and Canadians that there is a housing and homelessness crisis,” said Tim Richter, president of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness (CAEH), a national advocacy group that aims to end homelessness across the country. “There is support for action on ending homelessness and addressing Canada's housing need beyond just the homeownership piece of the housing crisis in Canada.” The letter endorses a six-point platform by Vote Housing, a national non-partisan campaign to end homelessness and improve housing in Canada, as well as a housing platform by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. Both platforms call for urgent federal action, significant new investments in housing construction, and supports like rental assistance to reduce core housing need, which is when a home is in need of significant repairs, is too small for the household that lives there, or costs more than 30 per cent of the household’s income. Richter said this is the first federal election in his memory where housing has been a top priority, and it reflects the views of Canadians. Eighty per cent of Canadians said they would be more supportive or somewhat supportive of a political party that proposes concrete action to end homelessness and build safe, affordable housing in Canada, according to a Nanos poll for the CAEH done in August. The letter explains that Canada’s rise in homelessness and unaffordable housing is a direct result of the federal government pulling investments in affordable housing and social services in the 1980s and 1990s. “This situation was created by federal policy, and it will take federal leadership to reverse its devastating consequences,” it reads. Although each party addresses housing in its platform, some commitments are stronger than others. The Green Party’s platform is the only one that mentions supportive housing, promising to invest in the construction and operation of 50,000 supportive housing units over 10 years. Supportive housing involves providing renters with a subsidy to make housing more affordable and pairing them with social workers and other services to help tenants with finances, assistance applications, getting to appointments, and other support. It is considered one of the most effective ways to address long-term homelessness, said Nick Falvo, a Calgary-based consultant and research associate with Carleton University specializing in homelessness and affordability. “When four of the five parties don't even mention supportive housing, that's quite disappointing,” he said. He said the Liberals, Conservatives, and NDP all put significant emphasis on first-time homebuyers in their platforms and little focus on homelessness, whereas the Bloc Québécois and Greens put more emphasis on addressing homelessness. A Green government would “declare housing affordability and homelessness a national emergency,” a Green party spokesperson said, as well as require housing developments that receive federal funding to ensure 30 per cent of all units in each development are deeply affordable and/or available to people with disabilities and special needs. Along with its supportive housing pledge, the Green Party also shares the Vote Housing call to action to build and acquire a minimum of 300,000 units of deeply affordable non-market, co-op, and non-profit housing over a decade. The Greens also pledge to “refocus” the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation “on supporting the development of affordable non-market and co-operative housing, as opposed to its current priority of supporting Canadian lenders to de-risk investment in housing ownership,” which Falvo said is “bold.” Steve Pomeroy, a housing policy research consultant in Ottawa, says the Liberal and NDP platforms heavily emphasize homeownership, despite the fact only about four per cent of Canada’s total households buy a home each year, meanwhile, renters make up 32 per cent of the population. “(Renters are) facing massive challenges in terms of rising rents, and ‘renovictions’ and a whole bunch of issues like that, and there's very little in (the platforms) that's really addressing serious affordability challenges for renters,” said Pomeroy. The NDP platform is also ambitious but less specific than the Greens’, pledging to “create at least 500,000 units of quality affordable housing in the next 10 years, with half of that done within five years.” The NDP’s platform does mention “fully implementing the right to housing” and says the party would work “toward the goal of ending homelessness in Canada within a decade,” which is in line with the asks from the letter, but thin on implementation details. The platform does mention adopting a “housing first” approach, a strategy that focuses on permanently housing people experiencing homelessness as quickly as possible. During the election campaign, federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pledged $5,000 in annual rent subsidies, though this is not reflected in the official platform. The Liberal housing plan would support the construction of 100,000 middle-class homes, build over 20,000 more units of new affordable rental housing, and revitalize 130,000 units that are in a state of disrepair. “Affordable” means a lot of different things to different people, said Pomeroy, meaning the devil will be in the details. Admittedly, though, it is hard to delve into all the specifics in an election campaign dominated by 10-second soundbites, he said. In 2017, the Liberals aimed to decrease homelessness by 50 per cent, but last fall, the party upped the ante, saying its new focus would be eliminating homelessness in Canada. Its platform also mentions making $4 billion available to cities through a Housing Accelerator Fund to further its goal to create the 100,000 middle-class homes, but it’s unknown whether the $4 billion would be administered as grants or loans. The Liberals also say they would double the existing Budget 2021 commitment to $600 million to support the conversion of empty office space into housing. “Every Canadian deserves a place to call home,” Liberal Party spokesperson Brook Simpson said in a statement, adding that, the party would build “on the success of the National Housing Strategy in addressing housing for the most vulnerable Canadians” to “accelerate new construction” and “make it more affordable and viable for first-time home buyers.” Overall, Falvo said the Liberals and NDP share a similar strategy, “bending over backwards trying to impress the first-time homebuyers.” To Falvo, the Conservatives seem least interested in helping renters. The party’s commitment to invest “$325 million over the next three years to create 1,000 residential drug treatment beds and build 50 recovery community centres across the country” is positive in that treatment programs are generally underfunded, but should not be considered a main response to homelessness, he said. “It suggests that the Conservatives under Mr. O'Toole are quite out of touch with mainstream homelessness thinking these days,” said Falvo. The Conservatives pledge to build a million homes in the next three years, a plan which includes a proposition to incentivize corporations and private landowners to donate property to Land Trusts for the development of affordable housing, but makes no mention of specific numbers of affordable units. Between rising home and rent prices and an increase in homeless encampments resulting from COVID, this issue is top of mind for Canadians, said Pomeroy. The mayors’ letter is less about determining which party currently has the right housing formula and is more about encouraging them all to adopt the calls to action, to at least some degree, so the federal government can be held to account after the election, he added. “I think the concern that the mayors are raising is that the platforms don't really articulate much in the way of what you're really going to do for the most vulnerable,” said Pomeroy.

"2021-09-20","Full text: This federal election is putting the spotlight on housing affordability in Canada. Many millennials want to own homes and fulfill the Canadian dream, but are unable to afford it. “If the last election was about jobs, jobs, jobs, this election is about homes, homes, homes,” said Ontario Real Estate Association (OREA) President David Oikle. OREA argues that will only happen if governments make it easier for first-time buyers to own a home. The advocacy group went through the platforms of the three major parties and broke them down under four different headings. Increasing Housing Supply Canadians want to own homes, but the lack of supply is causing a crisis, with more buyers chasing fewer and fewer homes. Creating more supply is essential in addressing the affordability crisis: Liberals: Building, preserving, or repairing 1.4 million homes over four years; converting empty office spaces into housing with $300 million in new funding; creating the Multigenerational Home Renovation Tax Credit to support secondary suites in homes; creating a Housing Accelerator Fund worth $4 billion to help cities build homes faster."

"2021-11-19","Full text: North American stock markets end losing week TORONTO - Canada's main stock index closed at its lowest level in nearly four weeks as its largest sectors came under pressure ahead of Monday's federal election. A confluence of factors affected markets on both sides of the border, including weak economic news out of China, rising COVID cases, U.S. infrastructure plan uncertainty and some uneasiness heading into the upcoming election, said Kevin Headland, senior investment Strategist at Manulife Investment Management. With another minority government expected in Ottawa, there is uncertainty over Liberal and Conservative tax plans. ""Typically, the election results in Canada do not really have much of an effect on the broad market,"" Headland said in an interview, ""but what we've seen leading up to prior elections is a sense of uneasiness, and the markets don't like uncertainty."" ""Just given that (it's) the Friday before the election on Monday, perhaps there's a bit of profit-taking there."" The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 111.74 points to 20,490.36, the lowest level since Aug. 23. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 166.44 points at 34,584.88. The S&P 500 index was down 40.76 points at 4,432.99, while the Nasdaq composite was down 137.95 points at 15,043.97. One commonality between movements in U.S. and Canadian markets is the calendar, with September being the worst month of the year, he said. Even Thursday's positive U.S. retail sales numbers were viewed through the prism of what that could mean for the Federal Reserve's decision on stimulus tapering. Investors are eagerly waiting for the central bank's interest rate decision and guidance on its upcoming moves on Wednesday. Although the market doesn't like the idea of ""taking the punch bowl away"" with stimulus being cut back, the last time this was done in 2013 and 2014 was actually positive for markets, Headland said. ""Even positive news can't can be seen as negative by this market right now."" Nine of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were down on Friday lead by energy, consumer staples, financials and materials. Energy dropped nearly two per cent as crude oil price slipped. The November crude contract was down 55 cents at US$71.82 per barrel and the October natural gas contract was down 23 cents at US$5.11 per mmBTU. Shares of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. were down three per cent, followed by MEG Energy Corp. and Whitecap Resources Inc. as 2.8 and 2.6 per cent, respectively. Headland said coal seemed to be a main driver for energy sector weakness. The Canadian dollar traded for 78.61 cents US compared with 78.90 cents US on Thursday. Headland expects the loonie could appreciate in value to 80 cents or above with continued support from oil prices. Even though gold and copper prices were lower, steel seemed to be a contributing factor with Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corp. down 5.8 per cant and Stelco Holdings Inc. off 4.8 per cent after U.S. Steel announced plans to build a new mill. ""Perhaps there's expectation that they'll be less demand for Canadian steel if there's an increase in production in U.S.-made steel,"" he said. The December gold contract was down US$5.30 at US$1,751.40 an ounce and the December copper contract was down 3.6 cents at nearly US$4.25 a pound. Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. led consumer staples lower while the heavyweight financials sector was down one per cent with Laurentian Bank down 2.3 per cent, Manulife Financial off 1.8 per cent and Royal Bank of Canada 1.5 per cent lower. Only health care and industrials were up on the day. Industrials climbed as Canadian National Railway Co. shareholders welcomed the company's strategic plans after walking away from its effort to acquire Kansas City Southern.

"2021-09-20","Full text: Trudeau links global detention initiative to China OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada spearheaded an international declaration denouncing state-sponsored arbitrary detentions because of China's decision to imprison Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Trudeau made the connection for the first time Friday during a federal election campaign appearance in Windsor, Ont. In February, when the federal government announced that it had created a coalition of dozens of countries denouncing the practice, it played down any connection that it was specifically targeting China, which has been angered by the declaration, nonetheless. Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau said at the time the declaration was ""country agnostic"" and was meant to be a broad denunciation of a coercive practices taking place in numerous countries, including Russia, Iran and North Korea. But on Friday, when asked about Canada's exclusion from a new American-Australian-British alliance on intelligence sharing in the Indo-Pacific region, Trudeau touted a number of other Canadian geopolitical alliances, including its historic role in NATO and its relatively new effort on calling out state-sponsored arbitrary detention. ""We continue to be there as a strong proponent for multilateralism, including on moving forward on things like the international agreement on arbitrary detentions that obviously stems from the arbitrary detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, but that concerns all countries around the world,"" Trudeau said. While the government has routinely branded Kovrig and Spavor's arrests by China as arbitrary, and called for their release, it went to great lengths not to portray the new arbitrary-detention initiative as something that was aimed directly at China. China has accused the two men of being spies, a claim rejected by Canada and its allies. The arrests are widely viewed as retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition request. The new declaration was born out of a year of behind-the-scenes international diplomacy in 2020 and was led by Garneau's predecessor as foreign affairs minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne. More than 60 countries have since signed on to the new pact, which doesn't have any mechanism to force offending countries to adhere to it. China has sharply criticized all attempts by Canada to build an international coalition to press it to release Kovrig and Spavor. And it has dismissed the arbitrary-detention declaration as essentially toothless and lacking the support of the majority of countries. The unexpected new alliance announced earlier this week between the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, known as AUKUS, raised questions internationally, and in Canada and the U.S. It became an issue on the federal election campaign trail where Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh criticized Trudeau for Canada's absence from the new pact. Trudeau shrugged off the criticism, saying Canada continues to be a member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance that includes the U.S., Britain, Australia and New Zealand. He also said the new AUKUS alliance was about bolstering Australia's navy against Chinese ambitions in the region by giving access to American nuclear submarine technology. ""Canada wasn't in the market for nuclear submarines, and therefore, this particular deal didn't involve us,"" Trudeau said Friday. David Perry, the vice-president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said the AUKUS alliance is also about closer intelligence sharing, and involves deeper defence industry co-operation and advanced research and development. ""I think it's clearly about more than just subs, and to frame it that way misses an important development,"" he said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 17, 2021.

"2021-09-19","Full text: Leaders ask voters to cast ballots on Sept. 20 OTTAWA - Federal party leaders on Friday made a plea for voters to go to the polls even though they debated whether the election in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic was needed at all. With just days to go before Monday's vote, polls suggest Justin Trudeau's Liberals and Erin O'Toole's Conservatives are running neck and neck and neither could land a majority mandate. Trudeau called the election on Aug. 15, sparking a 36-day campaign that he argued Friday morning wouldn't be an exercise in futility even if voters choose another minority government. Speaking in the border city of Windsor, Ont., Trudeau said the policy debates Canadians have had over the past five weeks will underpin the next government's agenda. The Liberal leader acknowledged that some voters may not think an election is necessary for the country to move past the pandemic, but he added that it is important to make a choice on Monday and asked progressive voters anew to support his party. ""People just want to get back to normal and even at the best of times Canadians are never very enthusiastic about an election,"" Trudeau said. ""I understand the frustration that some people are feeling — (they) just want things to get back to normal and an election isn't getting back to normal. It's a time of choice. It's a time of decision."" Trudeau also faced questions about a Toronto-area candidate who paused his campaign at the Liberals' request after the party learned he had faced a sexual assault charge that had been dropped. Speaking later in London, Ont., O'Toole said people are frustrated with having an election during a fourth wave of COVID-19 and argued Trudeau shouldn't be rewarded with another mandate. He also urged people to vote Monday and back his party's bid for power as opposed to the unnamed ""smaller parties"" he said the Liberals want voters to support. ""Your vote is the only way to stop Mr. Trudeau from gaining even more power,"" he said. ""Your vote is the only way to get the change we desperately need in this country."" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh expressed concern about how the lack of on-campus voting could make it more difficult for post-secondary students to cast a ballot on Monday, addressing a constituency the New Democrats have relied on in past elections. Singh said the issue is another reason why Trudeau shouldn't have called a pandemic election. ""It makes it harder for people to vote, but I still want to encourage people to vote,"" Singh said Friday in Sherbrooke, Que. ""There are lots of ways to vote. You can still do it."" Elections Canada has warned it may take five days to finish counting all ballots cast in-person and by mail, meaning the country may not know Monday how many seats each party won in the 338-seat House of Commons. Constitutionally, Trudeau as prime minister would get the first opportunity to test the confidence of the House of Commons after an election if no party wins a majority of seats. If the Liberals can't muster enough opposition support for a throne speech, for instance, the Conservatives would get a shot at forming government. And if that fails, the country would likely again be plunged into an election. When asked about governing in a minority, Trudeau said he was focused on winning seats and wasn't going to engage in hypothetical questions. Singh, when asked about the possibility of a minority government situation, replied with his party's positions. O'Toole, meanwhile, said he wanted to earn the trust of voters but added that he would look at the results and ""always put the country first."" Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet told reporters he would work with a minority government — which he said he expected — if it agreed to not step in to areas of provincial jurisdiction and boost health-care transfers. Blanchet said he was certain compromise could be achieved between the parties to avoid any political drama that would spur another federal vote. ""I want to meet with every party leader, after the election, and just discuss how we should work in order to prevent Quebecers and Canadians from having to go through this once again anytime soon,"" Blanchet said Friday. Blanchet also poked fun at Trudeau and O'Toole for each campaigning with a former prime minister — Jean Chrétien and Brian Mulroney, respectively — suggesting the former party leaders were more interesting that the current ones. Trudeau and O'Toole are hoping high-profile endorsements help tip the scales in their favour on Monday. On Friday, former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton tweeted that she wished Trudeau and ""progressive Canadian neighbors the best in Monday's election,"" echoing a tweet a day earlier from former U.S. president Barack Obama. Her one-time rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, tweeted his support for the NDP, saying Singh was the only leader ""who has the courage to make the wealthy pay their fair share so everyone gets the medication they need.""

"2021-09-19","Full text: The traditional leadership on Six Nations of the Grand River wants polling stations off the territory before Monday’s federal election. “It has been brought to our attention that the Canadian government has placed polling stations on Haudenosaunee Territory,” the chiefs and clan mothers who lead the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council said in a statement released Wednesday. “We urge those involved to immediately remove the polling stations and elections materials from the territory. This is a violation of not only treaty rights, but our human rights to exist as distinct people.” The Confederacy also instructed members of Canada’s most populous First Nations reserve not to vote. “The Confederacy Council has and always will discourage Onkwehonwe from participating in the election of leaders of other governments,” the statement read, using the Mohawk word for “original or first people.” Chiefs and clan mothers contend Haudenosaunee voting in Canadian elections is “a violation of treaties and commitments our ancestors made,” referencing the Two Row Wampum agreement made between the Haudenosaunee and Dutch settlers more than 400 years ago “to never interfere in one another’s government, laws and ways.” “We have never relinquished our sovereignty and we view the actions of all involved in Canada’s elections as doing such,” the Confederacy statement said. Representatives from the Confederacy could not be reached for comment. The Confederacy is distinct from Six Nations Elected Council, a legislative body led by Chief Mark Hill. In an emailed statement, elected council spokesperson Katie Montour said band members “have a free choice as to whether or not they decide to vote in any election.” “Having a polling location in our community is a way of respecting the right of our community members to exercise that free choice if they wish,” Montour said. Six Nations is part of the riding of Brantford-Brant. It is unclear how many polling stations are on Six Nations territory and whether the Confederacy has filed a formal request with Elections Canada to move the stations off the reserve. A spokesperson for Elections Canada did not respond by deadline. According to data from Elections Canada, 51.8 per cent of Indigenous people nationwide voted in the 2019 federal election, compared to overall voter turnout of 67 per cent. Six Nations of the Grand River has approximately 27,600 registered band members, of whom nearly 13,000 live on the reserve. Subject: Voting machines; Councils; Candidates; Elections; Sovereignty"

The incumbent Tony Baldinelli of the Conservative party went up against Melanie Holm of the Green party, Andrea Kaiser of the Liberal party and Brian Barker of the New Democratic Party (NDP). Peter Taras of the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) was not in attendance, but presented a video at the end of the debate. Here are five standout quotes from the debate. Tony Baldinelli on the Conservative party’s stance on mandatory vaccines for federal employees: “Vaccines are a safe and effective tool to help stop the spread of COVID-19, and we encourage everyone who is able to take one. But this government has done an incredibly poor job of making sure that rapid-testing capabilities are available in this country,” he said. “With regards to federal public servants, our position is exactly what the federal government’s position is: for those not vaccinated, they will have to pass a daily rapid test.”"

"2021-09-19","Full text: Despite the permit revocation and stalling of the operations of G & R Recycling last October, the harmful contamination caused by the centre’s activities in Kanesatake continues to stir up concern. An investigation published by The Eastern Door last Friday, September 10, revealed that over a five-year period, G & R had repeatedly released contaminants, some toxic, into bodies of water flowing into the Lake of Two Mountains, which meets the Ottawa River. Community members, environmental advocates, and politicians from far and wide reacted to the damning information made public. “I have many concerns about the possible effects on the environment,” said the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake (MCK) grand chief Victor Akwirente Bonspille. “Those concerns are going to be there for a long time – not just with me, but with our community at large.” The investigation draws on additional documents provided by a coalition of Onkwehón:we and settler advocates working with ReconciliAction; non-profit Eau Secours, and the Front commun québécois pour une gestion écologique des déchets (FCQGED). Quebec Indigenous Affairs minister Ian Lafrenière was quick to respond to the situation, which environmental experts consulted by The Eastern Door state have caused “a definite impact on the environment.” Last Friday, Lafrenière tweeted he had called Bonspille and that a tri-party meeting would take place in the following days. “There will need to be more than one meeting planned. The first one will be with us – the Indigenous Affairs office – the (provincial) environment department and the band council,” explained the minister in an interview with The Eastern Door. “Following this, we also have one planned with our equivalent at the federal level,” he continued, adding that federal Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) minister Marc Miller confirmed officials from his office would be present. An initial meeting took place on Thursday, September 16, between MCK, the local Environment Department, Quebec’s Environment Ministry, the provincial Indigenous Affairs department, ISC, Health Canada and Transports Quebec. With the support of these organizations, the council said it looks forward to rectifying the “problematic environmental issues” the community is facing. Another meeting is planned for October. In the meanwhile, contenders in the upcoming election have also spoken up on the matter. On Tuesday, September 14, the New Democratic Party (NDP) sent a press release in which they denounced what they call inaction by the Liberals. “Justin Trudeau’s Liberals are completely absent when they should be dealing with these bandits who are threatening the quality of the water and the environment in Kanesatake. They have not taken their responsibilities,” reads the communiqué signed by NDP candidate for the Montreal riding of Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie, Alexandre Boulerice. “Reconciliation with the (Indigenous) Peoples is also about ensuring the prevention of such irresponsible actions that harm Indigenous and surrounding communities.” Later in the week, the Green Party of Canada released a statement citing their outrage over an Indigenous territory being used as a “toxic waste dump,” and condemned it as an act of clear environmental racism. “It’s inconceivable that Kanehsatà:ke, one of the smallest Indigenous territories in Quebec, is contaminated by toxic waste from outside. The first step toward a solution is to make public the analyses that have already been done,” said Mario Guay, Green Party candidate in Mirabel. The press release denotes that from the party’s standpoint, the responsibility of decontaminating the site belongs to the federal government. “How can we have a reconciliation with the First Nations, Metis and Inuit when we allow their land to be contaminated?” stated the president of the Quebec wing of the Party and candidate in Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Luc Joli-Coeur. Documents obtained through access to information requests by The Eastern Door demonstrate that the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change had long been preoccupied by the contamination attributed with the site’s activities. The presence of substances such as p-Cresol, PCBs and metals, along with oxygen indication levels exceeding the chronic aquatic water quality criteria, were flagged as worrisome by ministerial inspectors, as well as ecotoxicologists consulted. In fact, a ministry report obtained by the coalition led by ReconciliAction and reviewed by The Eastern Door indicates results of PCBs – highly toxic industrial substances – found in the water flowing through the grounds of G & R were 676 times higher downstream from the site than upstream. “This is evidence that toxic PCBs, a group of substances controlled by federal law, are in the hazardous waste stored at the site,” reads the Green Party statement. Since the centre began operating in 2016, the ministry received numerous complaints regarding nauseating odours emitted from the site and alarming liquids leaking in streams flowing into the Lake of Two Mountains. Although non-compliance orders and fines were issued repeatedly, it wasn’t until October 1, 2020, that the ministry formally demanded the cessation of all activities at G & R. Lafrenière told The Eastern Door he was well aware of the persisting situation, which was flagged to him by “several people in Kanesatake.” Moreover, he explained he was aware work was currently underway to, among other things, “allow the government of Quebec to intervene on the ground.”While the owners of the demolition and construction sorting centre, Robert and Gary Gabriel, collaborated with the ministry when the company first began to operate, ministerial inspection reports obtained by The Eastern Door reveal the brothers hastily turned on the ministry, who they forbid from returning to Kanesatake. “He (Robert Gabriel) affirms that it is the end of the collaboration with Quebec and that the representatives of the Quebec government are not welcome on this Mohawk territory (...),” reads a ministry email dated April 2, 2020. According to the Environment Quality Act, ministry inspectors were still allowed to enter the site, especially because they were working closely on the file with the MCK. However, the regional ministry department chose to bend to the will of the owners and remain off the territory, reveals internal documents reviewed by The Eastern Door. In an article published by La Presse, the Parti Québécois (PQ) condemned the fact that inspectors yielded, even temporarily. “It’s unacceptable that following what amounts to intimidation, inspectors from the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change have folded and are no longer on-site to enforce the law,” PQ deputy Sylvain Gaudreault told La Presse. Setting aside the question of who should have stepped in, the contamination of the site remains a matter MCK is determined to resolve through a collaborative effort. “We’ve all known there was hazardous waste being disposed of at the site and we’ve also known that it could affect our water table if it’s allowed to sit there any longer without any remediation of the site,” said Bonspille. “The fact today is that we have to come together to fix the problem. We all know what the issue is and we all know the effects of the ongoing problems if they aren't fixed.” As federal elections approach on September 20, environmental advocates are calling on politicians not to disregard the situation, which has long plagued Kanehsata’kehró:non. “The Liberal government’s silence is deafening,” said ReconciliAction member, Louis Ramirez. “Their inaction and efforts to push this under the rug reflect the fact that they know G & R is a symbol and an image of their poor track record on reconciliation.” As of Thursday, there have been no statements made by either the Liberal or Conservative parties regarding the matter. laurence.b.dubreuil@gmail.com Subject: Community; Collaboration; Environmental impact; Councils; Politics; Climate change; Elections; Reconciliation"

"2021-09-19","Full text: Kaukab Usman has had a frustrating, and not uncommon, experience since moving to Mississauga. The Pakistani-Canadian immigrant returned to Peel five years ago, after a period back in her motherland. She has two masters degrees in English literature and educational leadership and, before moving to Canada, she enjoyed a successful career in academia. She is a volunteer with the Peel Poverty Strategy Action Group and sits on the City of Mississauga’s Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee. These experiences and talents seem to have counted for very little in the eyes of her adopted nation over the past half-decade. “You have dropped me in this country based on the qualifications that I have from my country and you recognized my experience from back home,” she said in an interview with The Pointer. “But why do I [then] become totally irrelevant in this country?” Usman is struggling with an issue that impacts many talented newcomers to Peel and across Canada. The country operates on a point-based immigration system that is designed to prioritize those would-be newcomers whose professional experience aligns best with the economic needs in different parts of Canada. Despite this, many arrive and immediately struggle to find work, or settle for under-employment while toiling at low-skilled jobs that do not utilize their education and experience. In some specific fields, foreign-born workers face years of retraining, while others are unable to find companies that value their international professional experience, opting instead to only hire staff with Canadian experience who have been educated here. Research has shown that such tendencies are not always born out of practical considerations, but cultural ones, as employers often don’t realize that a candidate with an accent or whose experience was overseas, would actually be better for the company because of their underlying talent. It is a problem that drove Usman to stand for election. She is the NDP’s candidate for Mississauga—Erin Mills. Her name is on the ballot alongside Liberal incumbent Iqra Khalid and Conservative candidate James Nguyen. Ewan DeSilva is standing for the Greens and Michael Bayer represents the People’s Party of Canada. Asked what her biggest priority would be if elected, Usman doesn’t hesitate. Reforming how Canada settles new immigrants and the work done by settlement agencies is a fiery passion. A rocky landing process is Canada’s biggest “brain drain” and “is not the start” talented and highly educated new arrivals should be subject to. Peel’s proximity to Toronto Pearson Airport and established diaspora communities make Brampton and Mississauga key destinations for many immigrants arriving in Canada. In total, more than 706,000 residents in the region were born outside of Canada — 94,000 new immigrants came to Peel between 2011 and 2016 alone. Usman believes Canada has “the best brains in the world” but bad coordination and outdated policies are wasting its talent. “The very understanding of who an immigrant professional is, is totally not correct,” she said. “First, we need to understand that they are not high schoolers, they are people coming in their mid-age and they are coming in with a lot of experience and at a very senior level of work experience. They are highly educated. The services that we get from these settlement agencies or these employment agencies are set at a level where you are only getting some kind of Tim Hortons job, assembly-line job or entry-level position. That is not what we need.” If Usman is elected, she will be well-positioned to begin to address these issues. The federal government oversees the immigration portfolio and has vast resources to “tweak”, in her words, how companies and industries develop relationships with newcomers. A new government planning to tackle the issue of immigration and settlement would likely need to set up its own task force or committee to hear directly from employers, experts and non-profits. Such work has been done before, by Peel’s own parliamentarians. Former Brampton Liberal MP Ruby Dhalla made the issue of foreign credential recognition her top priority in 2005, and introduced a successful motion to create a Foreign Credential Recognition Secretariat, within Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. When it was announced, the human resources minister at the time, Belinda Stronach (elected as a Conservative before she crossed over to the Liberal Party) said, ""The work of the Secretariat will help coordinate the various FCR initiatives under way to improve systems and processes so that immigrants are better able to integrate into the labour market. It is clear that Canada's future prosperity and competitiveness will depend heavily on how successful we are at integrating skilled immigrants and foreign-trained Canadians into our economy and society."" But the Conservative government under Stephen Harper undertook a number of bureaucratic changes to the portfolio and today foreign credential recognition falls largely under the jurisdiction of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, and also the ministry of Labour and the ministry of Families, Children and Social Development. Critics have said the foreign credential issue and practical measures to remove bureaucratic barriers to foreign-trained workers have not been dealt with ideally by the federal government over the past decade-and-a-half, since the original secretariat was created. The result is a confusing bureaucratic web and a wide variety of hoops to jump through. Some qualifications, such as law degrees obtained overseas, may require significant retraining since the intricacies of legal systems around the world vary dramatically, while other skills and talents are much more universal. “All the experience they bring from other countries is as valuable experience as anybody gets in Canada, or anywhere,” Usman said. “It is diverse experience, it is international experience. There are 101 different ways of doing things.” The NDP candidate highlights the inflexibility of the Canadian system. She says retraining schemes are a key issue for families who arrive in Canada. “It is very irrational in the sense that a person who is coming with a family has to put food on the table as well. So why is it that he’s not given the opportunity of doing both?” she said. “And then you are told that you have to have Canadian experience. What is Canadian experience? Is it going to Tim Hortons and pouring coffee?” The issue is one that pulls together key problems in Peel. It addresses questions about whether Canada’s immigration system sets new arrivals up for success, unlocking talent that is being underutilized. Policy changes could also help the country recover from COVID-19, Usman said, but if little changes, talent will continue to be wasted. “Then these people are stuck driving the cabs and they’re never able to come out of poverty,” she said. “This vicious cycle is affecting the social fibre of the country as well, where the families are kind of torn apart. They’re never meeting at the dining table and eating food together and everyone is living in their own silos … that is why we also have so many of these emotional issues, these mental health issues, everyone is feeling so alone, so lonely. There is no connection.” She said her priority is not something that only helps newcomers in Canada. Any policies to improve how new Canadians settle in the country can boost the overall economy as well. “I have seen that this is an industry where the immigration is a way of making money off immigrants,” she said. “These are half-squeezed lemons, the juice is still there. The government does not realize that there are more potentials for bringing in the money: they have this talent that is not utilized, they totally ignore it.”"

In 2005, public transit came to Charlottetown as the first of four buses began runs, 150 years after the city’s incorporation. It was the only provincial capital in Canada without a bus system. In 2007, Canadian actress Lois Maxwell, who played the definitive ""Miss Moneypenny"" in 14 James Bond films, died in Australia at age 80. In 2008, financial markets nosedived in the wake of the rejection of the $700-billion package negotiated by U.S. congressional leaders to bail out the financial industry. The Dow industrial average plummeted as much as 700 points, its biggest single-day drop, and Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index fell as much as 800 points. The TSX lost $100-billion in market value, and the Dow $1.2-trillion. Both indexes rebounded somewhat later in the afternoon. In 2012, Toronto-born convicted terrorist Omar Khadr was returned to Canada from Guantanamo Bay to serve out the remaining six years of his sentence in the 2002 death of a U.S. special forces soldier in Afghanistan. (In 2015, he was granted bail pending the appeal of his U.S. conviction for war crimes in Afghanistan.) In 2013, slotback Geroy Simon caught the 1,018th pass of his 15-year CFL career, breaking Ben Cahoon's record. (He retired at the end of the season with 1,029. In 2017, Nik Lewis surpassed Simon.) In 2018, The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a negotiated settlement of a suit filed against him for alleged securities fraud. The suit claimed his tweet in August that he had secured funding to take the company private was false and misleading. The settlement allowed Musk to remain as Tesla CEO but required him to step down as chairman for three years. In 2019, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said he took ""full responsibility"" for the grisly killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but denied allegations that he ordered it. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Prince Mohammed, 34, called it a heinous crime and that he took full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government. Asked if he ordered the killing of Khashoggi, who had criticized him in columns for The Washington Post, Prince Mohammed replied: ""Absolutely not."" He said the slaying was ""a mistake."" Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2, 2018, to collect a document that he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee. Agents of the Saudi government killed Khashoggi inside the consulate and apparently dismembered his body, which has never been found. Saudi Arabia has charged 11 people in the slaying and put them on trial, which has been held in secret. As of yet, no one has been convicted."

"2021-09-19","Full text: Niagara riding debates continued Wednesday evening as the candidates vying for the member of Parliament seat in the St. Catharines riding battled it out on YourTV Niagara. The incumbent for St. Catharines, Chris Bittle of the Liberal Party of Canada, went up against Krystina Waler of the Conservative Party of Canada, Trecia McLennon of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and Catharine Rhodes of the Green party. Rebecca Hahn of the People’s Party of Canada was not in attendance at the debate; instead, she was given the opportunity to speak in video shared at the end of the debate. Here are some stand out quotes from the Sept 8. debate: Chris Bittle on supporting small businesses post pandemic “When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we said we would have Canadians’ backs and that included business throughout St. Catharines, throughout Niagara, throughout Canada. We stepped up with wage supports, we stepped up with rent relief. We stepped up with additional supports for the tourism sector and other highly affected sectors. We’ve been there for small businesses from the start.” Krystina Waler on Trudeau’s reaction to Taliban occupation of Afghanistan “I want to be clear. Justin Trudeau knew that there was a war breaking out in Afghanistan before he called this election. He knew that we’d be leaving Canadians behind and he wanted to focus on an election instead of helping our fellow Canadians and our Afghan-Canadian allies escape the Taliban. It is unacceptable,” she said. “The Taliban are not our brothers and we need to help these people.” Trecia McLennon on access to clean drinking water across the country “The NDP is the party that will name environmental racism for what it is, and say that things like boil water advisories that have had to continue in Indigenous communities is completely wrong, and would stop immediately under an NDP government. Making sure that everybody in this country has clean drinking water is a priority. Clean drinking water is a foundation to a strong community and we would be committed to ensuring that every community across Canada, just like you won’t go to Toronto or Montreal or Vancouver and not find clean drinking water, we want to make that true for anywhere we go in Canada.” Catharine Rhodes on repairing relations with the Indigenous community “Indigenous peoples are not the past. Indigenous peoples are the first Canadians and our future and we honour them. We, at the Green party, would honour the treaties and respect all of the rights of the Indigenous peoples. We would implement all 94 calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation commission, right away. We would ensure access to clean drinking water, to education and to housing for Indigenous communities and would recognize the rights of non-status and Métis peoples as Indigenous, as we know that they have been left out of the community by current legislation.” Rebecca Hahn on her party’s campaign platform “I will oppose Bill C10 and C36 as they violate our freedom of expression. I will oppose vaccine mandates as they violate our right to liberty and autonomy,” said Hahn. “We’re going to balance the budget by eliminating deficits through spending cuts, such as corporate subsidies, foreign development aid and we’re going to defund that CBC.” Subject: Small business; Native peoples; Canadians; Drinking water; Pandemics; Elections; COVID-19"

"2021-09-19","Full text: A growing number of Canadians have expressed a desire for a fairer tax system, and a recent poll by Abacus Data revealed people are willing to change how they vote over this issue. The poll indicates strong support for NDP policies, which may leave other parties playing catch-up at a time when Canadians feel the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating inequality. Federal Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau critiqued the NDP’s plan to pay for its $214-billion platform by taxing corporations and the ultra-wealthy. “The idea that you can go with unlimited zeal against the successful and wealthy in this country to pay for everything else is an idea that reaches its limits at one point. And I don’t think the NDP get that,” Trudeau said at a La Prairie, Que., campaign stop last weekend. But federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said this is a limited way of thinking, and criticized Trudeau’s government by referencing a 2019 Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) report that found up to $25 billion a year in tax revenue is lost from corporations that avoid paying their share of taxes. He told voters in Sudbury, Ont., his government would “end Trudeau’s free ride for big corporations by closing loopholes and cracking down on big corporations avoiding their fair share of taxes,” pledging to use tax revenue for “cheaper prescription drug costs, more affordable homes and better health care for families and seniors.” The Abacus Data poll was based on NDP policy from the 2019 election, and found 89 per cent of Canadians support the NDP’s proposed tax of one per cent paid on wealth over $20 million as part of Canada’s pandemic recovery, and 92 per cent support closing tax loopholes and making it harder for corporations to strategically book profits in tax havens. The issue may have the power to sway voters: 89 per cent of Canadians surveyed said they would definitely or probably consider voting for a party promising to ensure everyone pays their fair share by increasing taxes on the wealthy and large, profitable corporations."
"2021-09-19","Full text: The federal election race in the Nickel Belt riding is shaping up to be a close on. Incumbent MP Marc G. Serré and NDP candidate Andréane Chenier are toe to toe in national opinion polls, and experts predict the New Democrat has a serious chance of unseating the Liberal candidate. The NDP’s recently released northern Ontario platform is giving the party an edge on the competition, and many voters in the riding are unhappy with the Liberal government’s decision to call an election during the fourth wave of the pandemic. But the Liberal party’s odds of winning nationally remain strong as voters prepare to head to the polls on Monday, experts say. “It’s a surprisingly close election. When the election was called, I would have thought Marc Serré, who is fairly well-liked and has good organization on the ground, would be a shoo-in,” said Nipissing University political scientist David Tabachnick. “But it looks like the NDP candidate has a pretty darn good chance. Depending on where you look, it may even be that she is in the lead.” The Nickel Belt riding is one of two federal electoral districts serving the City of Greater Sudbury. Covering 30,490 square kilometres, the riding includes parts of Greater Sudbury and the Sudbury district in addition to small portions of Timiskaming, Manitoulin Island, West Nipissing and Parry Sound. Census subdivisions within the riding include Cartier, Gogama, Killarney, St. Charles, Markstay-Warren, and Whitefish Lake. Nickel Belt has been represented in the House of Commons since 1953. According to Statistics Canada, it has a population of 90,962 with 72,134 people registered on the elector’s list. The riding historically flip flops between the Liberal Party of Canada and the NDP. The riding’s incumbent beat NDP candidate Stéphane Paquette in the 2019 election by 3,390 votes. Serré has been the Liberal MP for Nickel Belt since 2015. Latest projections on 338Canada.com are predicting that the Nickel Belt riding will see one of the closest races in northern Ontario and is considered a toss up. Serré and Chenier are in the lead running against Green party candidate Craig Gravelle, Conservative party candidate Charles Humphrey, and People’s Party candidate David Hobbs. Tabachnick said the NDP’s odds of gaining a pickup in the Nickel Belt riding were bolstered, in part, by its platform targeted to Northern Ontario. “I think the NDP leadership has done a good job, and that’s why the seemingly safe riding in the Nickel Belt has become quite competitive,” he said. “The Northern Ontario platform, which I think is pretty well-written for a regional platform, recognizes that the north has specific needs that are different from other regions. The NDP is the only party that mentions, for example, bringing back the Northlander rail service to our region.” The platform also touches on out-migration and the Laurentian University insolvency crisis. “We want people born here to get educated here at universities, and then find gainful employment and raise their families here, and also to attract new people to the region as well,” said Tabachnick. “There are various programs mentioned in the northern platform as well as specific mention around some of the troubles around LU. Of course, that’s a provincial jurisdiction, but there are things they can do.” Preserving French-language postsecondary education – whether at the University of Sudbury or elsewhere – will be of particular concern in the Nickel Belt riding, he added. According to Statistics Canada, 38 per cent of the riding’s population speaks French as their primary language. Additionally, just over half of Nickel Belt households speak both French and English at home, compared to 11.2 per cent of households in Ontario. “There are also very specific concerns around things like infrastructure, roads, services, and access to broadband internet that are significant to more rural and northern areas of the riding,” said Tabachnick. Nickel Belt NDP MPP France Gelinas said the stories you hear in the riding depend on which area you visit. Because of the riding’s immense size, voters tend to have vastly different experiences. “If you visit the malls in areas like Hanmer, Walden, and Chelmsford, you will see that many small businesses were forced to close because they couldn’t make it through the pandemic,” she said. “They are not happy. They are very stressed out. Not only was the pandemic hard on all of us, but they’ve lost the ability to make a living. I can’t say that I blame them.” Voters who live south of Sudbury in communities like the French River, St. Charles, and Sturgeon Falls aren’t very happy right now, either, she added. “They depend on tourism an awful lot. Because of the pandemic, last year was a complete washout and the year before, there was a big fire in the region that closed many of those businesses down,” she said. “These are outfitters. They are people who own campgrounds, hotels, and restaurants. They make a living out of the people that visit the region during the summertime.” On the other hand, there are other parts of the Nickel Belt riding that fared relatively well during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Most of the mines are in Nickel Belt in areas like Garson and Onaping, for example. Mining was an essential service during the pandemic, so most of the people who work in mining kept their jobs,” she said. “For these voters, there seems to be more of a mix. The ones who used to be Liberals are happy and the ones who used to be NDP want them back in office.” The northernmost part of the riding, which includes communities like Mattagami and Gogama, tend to be happier as well. “There is a brand-new gold mine opening across the street from them – IAMGOLD’s Cote Gold Project,” she said. “IAMGOLD has hired hundreds of people and is still looking to hire hundreds of people. A lot of people who come from the watershed see the opportunity to go back. I would say that this part of the riding is happier.” Although attitudes vary, Gelinas said there are a few issues that are raised across the board. “Access to health care is a huge one. Those who live close to Sudbury gain access to Sudbury’s services, but if you go a little bit outside Sudbury, access to health care is always an issue,” she said. “Another issue that you hear everywhere is the price of gas.” The price of gas fluctuates a lot in certain parts of Nickel Belt, said Gelinas. “There is no public transit in many of these communities. There is no alternative but to drive, and the distances are often long. They would like the federal government to regulate the price of gas,” she said. Voters in the Nickel Belt riding are also concerned about the government’s decision to call an election in the middle of the pandemic. “The Liberals will pay a price in Nickel Belt for calling an election right now,” said Gelinas, who has campaigned door to door with Chenier, the federal NDP candidate. “People are really afraid of COVID-19, and a lot of people have asked for help to get a mail-in ballot because they do not want to be exposed.” She added that every time she knocks on a door, she hears the same thing. “They say, I can’t believe Justin Trudeau spent $800 million of our tax dollars so he could try to get a handful more Liberal MPs,” she said. “People think that this is not the right time, and he could have accomplished his goals with a minority government.” Tabachnick said he’s surprised this has been such a big issue in this federal election. “Maybe because I am a political scientist, I know that no minority government really lasts more than two and a half years. To me, just historically, calling the election right now is not too soon,” he said. “But this fourth wave has kind of thrown a monkey wrench into that scenario, and I think people are just hunkered down.” Having to switch gears and start paying attention to the election has been frustrating for some, he added. “They just want to get their lives back to normal. They don’t want what might be viewed by some as an unnecessary distraction from getting back to work or getting the kids back to school,” he said. “I can understand the frustration, but for me, it’s not an issue. What we want to hear from our politicians is how they would govern, what policies they have, and how this post-pandemic economy and country is going to function.” The Local Journalism Initiative is made possible through funding from the federal government. sud.editorial@sunmedia.ca Twitter: @SudburyStar"

"2021-09-19","Full text: Depending on who you ask, Canada’s standing in the world has either flourished or diminished over the last few years. In this, our final topic to Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill and Newmarket-Aurora candidates of the 2021 Federal Election, we invited individuals hoping to be Aurora’s next Members of Parliament to look at the current state of Canada’s place on the international stage. AURORA-OAK RIDGES-RICHMOND HILL From the perspective of NDP candidate Janice Hagen, Canada has been consistently praised for its quality of life (affordability, education, jobs, income equality, safety and health care) and has consistently ranked at or near the top of all the nations in the world. That being said, however, while “social programs are obviously making a big difference” and we’re “privileged to live in a large, resource-rich country”, Canada is also “number one in the production of waste, number five in electricity use and number seven for carbon emissions.” “Yes, we are privileged but we are squandering that privilege,” says Hagan. “We must do more to keep Earth as #1 for the best planet to live on. We need to keep our emission reduction promises to the rest of the world and start sooner. More than most countries, we have the money and technology to be innovative and do better. This will create jobs and secure a future for generations to come. “We also need a strong and [principled] foreign policy based on human rights, global peace and security. As climate change advances, more land will become uninhabitable and this will be even more important. We will need to increase international aid, alleviating poverty and food insecurity, developing Canada and other countries with green infrastructure. Canada is not an island. Our survival and standard of life is tied to all other countries, whether we like it or not.” Conservative candidate Leona Alleslev, however, has a very different perspective, stating “Canada has never been more alone.” “The outcome of Canada’s bid for a seat on the UN Security Council must serve as a wake-up call,” she says. “Canada’s quick and decisive loss is a reflection of the world’s report card on Canada’s current place and standing under this Liberal government. The world needs more Canada, so why did the world say, ‘no thanks’?” Canada’s economy, she says, “may soon fall out of the Top 10”, and she notes that the renegotiation of NAFTA left Canada worse off with “managed” trade rather than “free” trade. “At the same time, Canadians are proud to be a nation that defends the rule of law and human rights including LGBTQ+ rights, but Trudeau compromised these core Canadian values by failing to condemn anti-gay laws in Senegal and Uganda or challenge authoritarian regimes for their blatant disregard for the rule of law. “Canada has been known for “punching above our weight” but since 2015 the number of Canadian peacekeepers and peace-keeping missions has fallen to its lowest number in 60 years. Canada is among the lowest NATO defence contributors and our allies have threatened to stop sharing critical intelligence since Trudeau has failed to ban Huawei.” Canada’s “declining international status is of grave concern” and Canada must change with a changing world, she says. “The Conservative Canada’s Recovery Plan will advance the national interests of Canada, with every decision on the world stage prioritizing: security and sovereignty of Canadians; prosperity of our people and our partners; and the democratic values that define us. Canada’s Conservatives will adopt a foreign policy that seeks new and strengthened alliances with democratic allies and economic partners who share our values. We will establish a Canadian National Interest Council to implement our long-term security and economic priorities and grow Canadian strategic and economic influence. We will take a principle-based approach with the Chinese Communist Party, standing with the Chinese people and promoting greater freedom for them. We will be unwavering champions for human rights, dignity, and transparency. In cooperation with our Five Eyes allies, we will build Canadian capabilities to contribute to foreign intelligence focusing on closing current gaps in understanding international threats of economic coercion, digital threats, and foreign interference. Canada’s Conservatives will make capacity building, economic reconciliation, and sovereignty expression core priorities of our approach to the North.”"
"2021-09-19","Full text: Aurora residents had a chance to see their candidates on both sides of the riding border field questions and challenge each other in an all-candidates debate hosted virtually by the Aurora Chamber of Commerce. With the exception of the Conservative candidates – Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill incumbent Conservative candidate Leona Alleslev said she was unable to fit the debate in her schedule but attended a similar event the following evening hosted by the Richmond Hill Board of Trade – individuals who have stepped up to be on the ballot next Monday, September 20, shared views and volleys for nearly two hours. As the event was hosted by the Chamber, many of the questions were posed to candidates through a business lens, including how each party’s platform will address the national deficit and the how the deficit impacts local businesses and business owners. First to tackle the issue was People’s Party of Canada candidate Anthony Siskos (Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill) who said that Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, as Prime Minister, has created a deficit that has ballooned beyond any of his predecessors. “We need to move forward responsibly because that is why housing is so expensive, because the Canadian dollar has been debased,” he said. “Now, a house is $1 million – not for our parents though. The Canadian Dollar needs to be restored. We need to really hone in on what it means to pay down this deficit. We as the PPC need to hold taxes as it is. Moving forward, our first mandate will be to lower taxes – for everyone, for business, for income. It is insulting to go out and say this administration hasn’t been completely reckless with our money that we have earned collectively.” While the Liberal candidates would go on to challenge this idea of “recklessness”, next up to speak was Newmarket-Aurora independent candidate Dorian Baxter who said tackling the deficit would be his first priority if elected. “It is a situation whereby our children’s children and their children are going to be enslaved,” said Baxter. “The time has come for all of us to stand on guard for this country of ours financially.” Libertarian candidate Serge Korovitsyn (Aurora-Oak Ridges- Richmond Hill) said he was for small government and said a way to lower the debt would be to “fire 90 per cent of the government ministries and government offices.” “We have been, as a country, creating more ministries, more government employees and everything can be run by the private sector,” he said. “Once we do that, we have to stop our government babysitting everyone and getting into the lives of the citizens of Canada.” Following the Libertarian candidate, Liberal candidate Leah Taylor Roy (Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill) took the PPC candidate’s claims head-on, stating the incumbent government tackled “the largest economic crisis” to face the country since the Great Depression and “had Canadians’ backs.” “We went into debt for Canadians who couldn’t do it,” she said. “You were criticizing this – would you have let people go hungry? Would you have let all these small businesses fail? We had to do this. We did the right thing by taking this on. The money wasn’t squandered. The money was spent and we already see our economy starting to come back, our jobs returning more quickly, because we did keep money in the economy.” Added Newmarket-Aurora Liberal candidate Tony Van Bynen: “The hardship our economy has suffered over the last 18 months has never been seen before. A responsible government is one that makes sure we look after our citizens, we look after our businesses… those that feel we shouldn’t have done anything are only reflecting that they truly do not understand the scale and the scope of this country and the values we stand for. I am not one to turn my back on those values.”"
"2021-09-19","Full text: In a press release sent to The Bancroft Times and also posted on their website and Facebook pages, South Algonquin Township announced that they had filled the vacancy in Dickens ward with the appointment by council of William Rodnick, a former councillor in the township with many years of experience in municipal politics, including eight years as a councillor for Dickens ward in South Algonquin Township from 2010 to 2018. The vacancy in Dickens ward came about as a result of the resignation of Councillor Joe Vermaire back on July 27. At their Aug. 4 meeting, South Algonquin township council voted to fill the vacancy by appointing a suitable candidate versus having a by-election, as a by-election at this point would be cost-prohibitive and would save time, with only 15 months to go until the next municipal election. In the press release from Sept. 7, Mayor Jane Dumas thanked all the applicants who put their names forward to fill the Dickens ward vacancy. She said they had a number of excellent candidates and she and council were pleased that so many people were interested in serving the community by wanting to serve on the township council. After much debate and discussion, Dumas said that council decided to appoint Rodnick to the vacancy. “Mr. Rodnick has spent eight years on the local municipal council and decided prior to the last election that due to work commitments at that time to step away from the table,” she said in the press release. “We hope you will join us in welcoming Mr. Rodnick back as your Dickens ward representative on municipal council.” Rodnick says he was very excited to be appointed to represent Dickens ward and that he and his wife Kim have been year-round residents on Aylen Lake for about 15 years. “I look forward to working with the rest of council in completing any projects and plans as well as addressing any issues that come up. Council members all have a diversified background and bring different skills to the table. I just want to contribute what I can with my background in finance. It is a great sense of accomplishment when you can do things that can enhance your community and make life just a little better for all,” he says. Rodnick says that he hopes to run in the next general election in 2022 and he hopes to serve the residents of Dickens ward, is willing to represent them for as long as they want him to and to do it well enough to earn their votes. “I was very happy to see the level of interest in this position. It demonstrates that people are taking a greater interest in what transpires in our area and offer additional skills to our community. We live in a great area and I intend to spend the rest of my life here. I have a vested interest in seeing it thrive,” he says. “The residents can feel free to contact me directly to ask questions or if I can be of any assistance to them.” Subject: Local elections; Appointments & personnel changes; Councils; Special elections"
"2021-09-19","Full text: Leaders assign blame for Alberta's COVID-19 crisis OTTAWA - Federal leaders pointed fingers and fired rounds at each other Thursday over the spiralling COVID-19 crisis in Alberta, each seeking to forge a link in voters' minds between the province's dire health emergency and the others' policies. A day earlier, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney reintroduced limits on gatherings along with elements of a vaccine passport system — after months of resistance — as he declared a public health emergency that is threatening to overload intensive care units. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said conservative politicians across the country have been less effective in fighting the pandemic, and questioned whether Tory Leader Erin O'Toole should be sitting across from them at the premiers' table. ""Just a few days ago Mr. O’Toole was still applauding Mr. Kenney for his management of the pandemic,"" Trudeau said in Montreal, claiming that ""anti-vaxxers within his own party run the show."" O'Toole had praised Alberta’s testing and contact tracing regimes Sunday as efforts for the federal government to emulate. ""He won’t demand that all his candidates get vaccinated. He doesn’t criticize his candidate who wasn’t fully vaccinated who goes into seniors’ homes,"" Trudeau said, referring to Michelle Ferreri, the Tory candidate for Peterborough-Kawartha who posted photos of herself to social media canvassing in a retirement residence despite having received only one shot. Trudeau said ventilators are en route to Alberta and that he has asked Canada's top civil servant to ""offer any support we can,"" including seconding medical professionals to infection hot spots. Minutes later at an event in Saint John, N.B., O'Toole pinned the deteriorating situation in the province largely on Trudeau while avoiding any mention of Kenney's name, despite being asked about him repeatedly by reporters. He said the Liberal leader let the Delta variant gain a ""bigger hold"" than necessary and proceeded to trigger an election amid a surging fourth wave. ""Rather than double up our resources to fight this Delta spread, he called an election. The $600 million this election costs could be helping all provinces in their fight,"" the former military helicopter pilot said, pledging to be their ""wingman."" ""I would never call an election in the middle of a health crisis."" In Toronto, New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh said the fault lies with Kenney but insisted Trudeau must share responsibility, since he set off an election campaign that has soaked up attention and resources and sent candidates to doorsteps across the country ahead of voting day on Monday. ""There's no question that Mr. Kenney is to blame here and that his leadership has been horrible. But it doesn't also dismiss the fact that Mr. Trudeau called an election while the fourth wave was hitting hard — while everyone knew that it was going to hit,"" Singh said. He also criticized the Liberal leader for not expanding paid sick leave, though the party has now promised to do so in its platform. The NDP plans to change its tactics on the ground to adapt to Alberta's unfolding crisis, Singh added, but offered no specifics, saying an ""assessment"" is underway. With its health system under threat of collapse, the province is asking for help from its neighbours to use their intensive care beds and staff while prepping its triage protocols, which would see doctors forced to choose who gets life-saving treatment and who does not. ""We may run out of staff and intensive care beds within the next 10 days,"" Kenney said Wednesday. ""Unless we slow transmission, particularly amongst unvaccinated Albertans, we simply will not be able to provide adequate care to everyone who gets sick."" Alberta has 269 patients in intensive care in a system set up for 173. Of the patients in ICUs, 218 have COVID-19 — the vast majority unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Kenney apologized for misreading COVID's predicted path in June and said ""it is now clear that we were wrong,"" but added he wasn't sorry for lifting all restrictions. In neighbouring Saskatchewan, Premier Scott Moe announced Thursday the province will bring in a mask mandate Friday and a proof-of-vaccination scheme on Oct. 1 in a bid to boost immunizations. Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam also painted a grim picture of what could lie ahead if more people don't embrace the vaccines. ""Unless we can quickly reduce overall transmission rates through accelerated vaccination and other measures where the virus is surging, continued expansion of the epidemic could lead to higher case counts than we have experienced thus far,"" Tam said at a news conference Thursday. Nearly seven million eligible Canadians have yet to get two jabs, she said, stressing vaccines' importance in the face of the Delta variant. The mutated virus is ""highly contagious and more severe,"" threatening to push hospitalizations beyond health systems' capacity in some areas, Tam said. Reserving his harshest salvos for O'Toole, Trudeau held much of his fire against Kenney and said the prime minister's pandemic role with the provinces is to ""encourage"" and ""support"" with billions of dollars and millions of rapid tests. “It’s not my job to judge or to criticize or certainly not to tell people what to do in the provinces. They are duly elected,"" he said. Singh reacted hours later: ""You know what, if he doesn’t think it’s his job, maybe someone should replace him."""

There are still a lot of people who are struggling with the uncertainty, with the challenges that have resulted from COVID [and voting] is one more thing for them to try and deal with, manage, and think about.” When she’s face to face with these voters, the incumbent candidate says she encourages everyone to realize “this is the opportunity to shape the future direction of the nation,” a future she would very much like to be a part of as Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill’s next Member of Parliament. “The reason I got into politics in the first place was because I am actually quite concerned with the future of the country and being able to protect the things we have and shape the future for the world as it changes, and our place in it,” she says. “That is even more true today than it was six or seven years ago when I started. If the constituents [of the riding] are still willing to place their trust in me, then I believe I still have a contribution that I can make to the future that citizens and the country hope that we can achieve.” As she enters the home stretch of the 2021 Federal Election campaign, one which culminates in Election Day on Monday, she says she is proud to take the Conservative Party’s platform to the electorate. It is a platform she says she has had the opportunity to influence and one plank she says she is particularly proud of is addressing climate change. “I think it hits exactly the right balance between makings sure that Canada can be contributing to addressing urgently climate change and doing our part as global citizens, but also encouraging other countries to meet some of the highest environmental standards that Canada has, and to lead the way on that,” she says. “I am proud of our mental health and long-term care [strategies]; I think COVID has shown that different provinces have different standards of care and we collectively decided as Canadians that we wanted a minimum universal standard for health care so that it didn’t matter where you lived in the country you were able to access the same level of care. To now talk about mental health supports and protections, as well as standards for seniors in long-term care homes into the Canada Health Act, I think that is really important.” Physical and mental health is a key theme Ms. Alleslev says she has been hearing from residents, along with issues of precarious employment. A conversation needs to be had, she says, on how to increase the number of quality jobs, not simply the quantity, particularly addressing contract workers or those who may not have any hours to work in a given week. “Zero hours in a week for me doesn’t mean that you have a job but we have to work to be able to communicate that and to do more so that people have not only employment but quality employment,” she says. Quality manufacturing is also a top-of-mind concern for Ms. Alleslev who comes into the race as a retired member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, and with a background in procurement in both the public and private sectors. “Canadians are very proud of being able to punch above our weight,” she says. “For the pandemic to show that we’re not actually able to look after ourselves as we thought [in areas of health, critical goods manufacturing, food supply and information systems] has had a significant impact on our psyche and I have heard it at the doors. To be able to look at some critical things, investing in domestic manufacturing and that, in turn, offering more quality of jobs, and in turn addressing the Consumer Price Index and affordability of life, that is really resonating at the doors as well.” A topic which has been a passion for her in previous campaigns has been comprehensive tax reform and that is still close to her heart as she works to make sure Aurora’s south riding stays a Conservative blue. If she is re-elected to the House of Commons, this will be an area of focus as part of Erin O’Toole’s team. “Leaders are important, teams are important, ideas are important and the ability to get things done is also important,” says Ms. Alleslev on why Conservative leader O’Toole is the right person to lead Canada in a new parliament. “We’re lucky that we have a leader who can lead, a team of competent, wise, experienced candidates and Members of Parliament to support that, an incredibly well-thought-out, detailed, balanced, costed plan and a commitment and a track record of actually getting things done as opposed to merely talking about it and then not being able to.” As she looks back on the first few weeks of the election campaign, Ms. Alleslev says the Conservative party has been branded by other parties “in a way that is not an accurate reflection of the party.” They are a party, she says, that is a reflection of the Canadian population – “inclusive” and “celebrating the diversity of all the communities in our country and what they have brought to us in the past and what contributions they will make in the future.” “Your voice does matter and please get out,” she says. “Our country is worth it and our future is worth it.” Subject: Manufacturing; Long term health care; Mental health; Canada Health Act; Employment; Elections; Political parties"

"2021-09-19","Full text: As a resident of Aurora and Newmarket for more than 35 years, Tim Flemming has raised his family here, is seeing his grandchildren flourish, and is taking an active role in fighting for the change he wants to see as Newmarket-Aurora’s Green Party candidate in the September 20 Federal Election. Heading door to door in the final heat of the campaign, he is doing so with a particular focus on climate change. In the last election, it was an “important” issue for the community, but things have changed over the past 20 months. “What has become a very important issue is now an imperative,” he says. “The platform of the Green Party is the most aggressive and assertive in addressing a very severe condition for the country, for the world, and right here at home.” The Green Party’s plan is, he says, a “very well-balanced, well-thought out” platform that he is proud to take to local voters – and integral to the climate platform is an emphasis on the “renewal economy.” “Places like Newmarket, Aurora, and Richmond Hill are uniquely positioned to actually be leaders in this space,” he says. “We certainly have a lot of very bright minds, a reasonably progressive thinking, we have some interesting technology [developments] going on and renewable platforms already. We have a healthy and educated workforce and the conversion to a renewable energy economy is going to take all of those factors. “I think we can make a real difference and not only establish some exceptionally good jobs for a lot of the young folks out there. I think we have a chance to be a leader in hydroelectric transportation.” Aurora and Newmarket are communities that have grown rapidly and are on track to continue to do so. Growth is not something Mr. Flemming says he opposes, but it is something that could be done “more efficiently” in terms of construction to address both environmental and cost factors. “Folks are very much concerned about the disparity of housing and in costs,” he says, touting a National Housing Strategy that will go towards addressing these concerns. “In many ways, we do have the same homelessness challenges to a lesser degree in Town. We do have people who need help and, to me, that is what a government – and governing – is all about. While we’re also going to build them, I think we need to reassess. About two years ago, the government of the day installed the stress test and this has made it extremely difficult [as] the math says it almost cuts the value of someone investing and starting a home in half. It is worthy to take a look at that.” Immediate action, he adds, must be taken on Canada’s recovery from COVID. Mr. Flemming personally believes strongly in double vaccinations, but he said he also respects the choice of individuals on vaccines, rapid testing and masking. “When people live together, they also have to share the space,” he says. “We have to protect individuals [but] there is a balance. There probably needs to be some level of sustained continued fiscal support from the government.” That being said, however, he says some supports need to be reassessed. “Long-term, I have a lot of faith in our community, in our folks, in our employees, and I believe generally in people,” he says. “I don’t believe people are malingerers; people aren’t aspiring to operate at the $10.50 an hour they’re going to get from CERB. They want to get back in their community, put food on the table, and we need to continue but wean off of it.” A “financial guy” by day, Mr. Flemming says he is conscious of the issue of affordability beyond housing and CERB, straight down to families putting food on the table and gassing up to get where they need to go. “I don’t think we need government intervention, but we do need to have potentially the right stimulus or the right support around background things,” he said, making specific reference to supply chain and transportation elements. “Maybe there is a slight lift in short-term taxation relief, but I do know that more problematic of many things is we have gone through a decade of less than two per cent inflation; our economy has not developed to run a 3.5 or 4 per cent. That will be a challenge.” All too often it is said that a vote for the Green Party is essentially throwing your vote away, a notion that Mr. Flemming says he often encounters – and counters – at the door. “I highly value my vote – my personal vote and the joy and honour of being in a democracy like Canada,” he says. “You make the choice that works most appropriately for you – matches your morals, your values…and you don’t walk a mile in one step but move in the right direction. The Green Party doesn’t exist solely to be able to have the necessary 170+ seats. It would be wonderful if [party leader] Annamie Paul could, but the reality is we have a role and responsibility to continue to educate, to highlight, and make our elected officials, whoever they be, accountable. “In Canada, in our current democracy, accountability comes on September 20. Honour your choice, do what you think is appropriate, and I always think wherever you place your vote, I never see it as a throwaway.” Subject: Elections"
"2021-09-19","Full text: Indigenous leaders gathered virtually on Wednesday to discuss the issues they say are important to them as we close in on next week’s federal election and to push for more First Nations people in Manitoba to get out and vote. A Facebook live event hosted by the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) on Wednesday was dubbed ‘I am First Nations and I Vote,’ and brought several members of Manitoba’s Indigenous leadership together for a virtual town hall to discuss the issues they believe are important to focus on regarding Monday’s federal election. AMC Grand Chief Arlen Dumas began by voicing his disappointment because he said previously promised meetings between Manitoba’s Indigenous leadership and some federal parties did not end up taking place. “A month ago we had sent out a letter to all the federal leaders asking that we could have a conversation with them, to ask them about their platforms, and to ask them what their priorities are with First Nations,” Dumas said. “We did have commitments from the Liberals, the NDP, and the Conservatives surprisingly, but unfortunately that deadline was this week, they had all committed that they would make themselves available, but they haven’t for whatever reason. “It’s unfortunate, and I believe that reflects poorly on all of them, so if they don’t want to come to us we are going to let our voices be heard loud and clear here today.” During the meeting Assembly of First Nations (AFN) Regional Chief Cindy Woodhouse noted that AFN has publicly released a document titled ‘The Healing Path Forward,’ that she said lays out what AFN is looking for and focused on regarding the upcoming election and its results. The document lays out five specific action items AFN wants to see focused on by the next federal government. The five priorities are listed as truth, reconciliation and healing for First Nations and all Canadians, climate and conservation leadership with First Nations, economic growth, prosperity and wealth-building for First Nations, promoting peace by respecting First Nations’ jurisdiction, and rebuilding and strengthening First Nations. Woodhouse said that if First Nations people don’t get out and vote the issues they are focused on could be overlooked by the next government. “It is so important that we vote and pay attention to these issues because everything affects us,” Woodhouse said. “Your vote matters, and when these people make decisions they look at which communities vote, so get out and vote, it’s so important.” She added she believes federal leaders need to start paying a lot more attention to First Nations issues, because of growth in First Nations communities. “Our population is growing at a faster rate than the Canadian population and is younger, our population is growing both on and off reserves,” Woodhouse said. “All parties should be chasing the First Nation’s vote.” — Dave Baxter is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the Winnipeg Sun.

"2021-09-19","Full text: Next Manitoba premier will be a woman WINNIPEG - Manitobans will have a female premier for the first time. Shelly Glover, a former Winnipeg police officer and one-time Conservative member of Parliament, and Heather Stefanson, a former Manitoba health minister, are the official candidates for the next leader of the province's Progressive Conservative party. Former premier Brian Pallister stepped down earlier this month and a leadership vote is to take place Oct. 30. The party said Thursday that Glover and Stefanson are the only candidates who met all requirements for the race by the deadline. Stefanson said she is excited to be on the ballot and, if selected, looks forward to moving the party forward. ""Regardless of what happens in this race, Manitoba will be led by a woman for the first time in its history. This is an exciting and historic time for Manitoba,"" she said in a statement. Candidates had to provide nomination signatures from 50 party members in good standing, an entry fee of $25,000 and evidence of having sold at least 1,000 new party memberships. They also had to participate in an interview to ensure a commitment to the party's principles and values. ""This is a rigorous application process that embodies a broad range of factors, all of which have been carefully considered,"" George Orle, chairman of the leadership election committee, said in a release. ""It's an exciting time for us to engage Manitobans to elect the next premier of Manitoba, and we look forward to an enthusiastic campaign."" Glover officially announced her intention to run last week and said she opposes COVID-19 vaccine mandates for front-line workers. She also said that if chosen leader, she would review how the government decided to require people to be vaccinated to enter restaurants, theatres, sports arenas and other venues. The Tory government also brought in a requirement for health-care staff, teachers and others who work with children and vulnerable people to be fully vaccinated or tested up to three times a week. Glover's team said Thursday they will continue to campaign and approach every eligible voter to earn their support. Stefanson started her campaign last month after Pallister announced he was stepping down. She submitted her resignation from her cabinet position so she could run for the leadership. Stefanson has been the legislature member for the south Winnipeg constituency of Tuxedo since 2000. She has also served as minister of the justice and families portfolios. She was deputy premier before she took over the health file earlier this year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Progressive Conservative backbencher Shannon Martin, who began his campaign Monday, withdrew from the race Wednesday night. In a statement posted online in all capitals, Martin thanked his campaign workers but said the team ultimately came up short. ""We tried. We stepped up. And we put forward a realistic vision that didn't reinvent the wheel but instead reflected (Manitobans),"" said the statement. Ken Lee, a former chief financial officer for the PC party, was also vying for the leadership, but it appears he did not qualify as a candidate. The party would not comment on the specifics of the application process. Pallister, who took over the Tory leadership in 2012, led the party to its largest majority government in a century in 2016 and to re-election in 2019. Pressure for his exit began to mount in the summer after he came under fire for comments he made about Canadian history. He said that people who came to Canada before and after it became a country did not come to destroy but to build. He eventually apologized. Glover or Stefanson will become the only woman to head a provincial government in Canada. Caroline Cochrane is the premier of the Northwest Territories.

"2021-09-19","Full text: Party candidates vying to be the Bow River riding’s new Member of Parliament (MP) in the upcoming federal election had an opportunity to address the public during an organized forum on Sept. 13. The event was held at the Strathmore and District Agricultural Society, where the candidates were each given time to answer previously determined questions and to interact with attending constituents. Candidates in attendance represented five opposing parties running in the Bow River riding. These included the Conservative Party of Canada, the Liberal Party of Canada, People’s Party, Maverick Party, and Christian Heritage Party. An allotment of three minutes per candidate was strictly enforced during the forum, during which time candidates had the opportunity to answer pre-determined questions relevant to the Bow River constituents. Included among the discussion topics was the representative’s and the party’s view regarding the potential for mandatory vaccinations. “We oppose mandatory vaccines. They’re unscientific, they’re unethical, they violate personal autonomy, they’re socially dysfunctional, historically naïve, legally problematic, morally dubious, impractical and economically unsustainable,” said Christian Heritage Party candidate, Top Lipp. “The COVID-19 vaccine appears ineffective at stopping the COVID-19 pandemic. What’s happening is real. They may actually pressure the virus to mutate into a more vaccine resistant form … natural immunity is more robust and durable than vaccination,” he said. Liberal Party Candidate, Getu Shawile took a much different approach to the argument. “Vaccines are 100 per cent safe … I respect the rights of the people on both sides of the debate,” he said. “The Liberal Party wants to continue to invest in COVID-19 research and help with provinces and territories with what is required to litigate the COVID-19 pandemic.” Conservative Candidate Martin Shields argued that it should be a choice — being available to those who want it, but not mandatory for those who do not. “I’m not in favour of mandating it and neither is our party … but for people who want to make a choice to request some kind of documentation, you’re going to get that card so you can prove that you can go there,” said Shields. “If it’s an option that people want because they can do that with a government recognized piece of paper, go for it. That’s an individual choice.” Orrin Bliss, representing the Maverick party, said the decision for someone to get vaccinated should be between the individual and their doctor and not something to be imposed by politicians. “I’m not anti-vaccine at all, I really enjoyed growing up without polio. But … a mandatory vaccine contravenes our right to life, liberty and freedom,” said Bliss. “This is my body, your bodies, what you put into them is your decision. Our rights do not end where other’s fears begin.” Jonathan Bridges with the People’s Party, stood firmly against mandating vaccines and vaccine passports of any kind. “I’m absolutely against … a Prime Minister who is trying to excite the people against unvaccinated people, by telling them that it’s for their child’s safety that everyone needs to be vaccinated,” he said. “However, I do believe that this is something of a big enough consequence that I feel the federal government should stand up for the rights of people to decide what is best for them.” Campaigns and platforms for each of the five candidates can be found online along with more information about where they stand and what their views are. Constituents eligible to vote are encouraged to find out more about the candidates prior to casting their vote for the election on Sept. 20.

"2021-09-19","Full text: The timing of the release of her book Indian in the Cabinet: Telling Truth to Power was less than a week before the federal election Sept. 20, but Jody Wilson-Raybould said that was no more than a coincidence. The former Liberal Cabinet minister, however, did say she hopes voters take into consideration what she has to say about her experiences in government when they mark their ballots. “I think it’s important to tell of my experiences… how government operates, and the expectation that I have around leadership and what leadership means,” she said. “I think it’s an important story to tell so I hope people keep in the back of the mind what type of leader they want, and what types of values and principles do they want that leader to have,” she said. Wilson-Raybould discussed the book as part of the virtual Vancouver Writers Fest’s In Conversation with Dana Gee. Close to 400 people tuned in to the special event Sept. 15. Wilson-Raybould said she was personally “courted” by Liberal leader Justin Trudeau in 2014 on a promise of “doing politics differently”. The Liberals were swept into power in 2015 with a majority government and Wilson-Raybould with it as Vancouver Granville MP. She became the first Indigenous person to hold the position of Attorney General and Justice minister. The SNC-Lavalin affair forms the backdrop of the memoir and makes up a “significant part” of Wilson-Raybould’s experience in federal government. She testified that she had been pressured by Prime Minister Trudeau, members of his office and other high ranking government officials to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya, and to offer a deferred prosecution agreement. The situation ultimately led to her resignation from Cabinet. She was then expelled from caucus by Trudeau, who also expelled Jane Philpott, who had resigned her position as president of the Treasury Board in support of Wilson-Raybould. However, even before the SNC Lavalin scandal, Wilson-Raybould says she was aware that values she held dear, such as inclusion, equality and diversity of perspective, which she said she and Trudeau talked about before she ran for office, were not at the forefront of how the Liberal government did business. “I’m a proud Indigenous person in this country. I went to Ottawa and sat around a Cabinet table and realized that I was treated like an Indian, recognizing that the Cabinet table that I was a part of saw me as an Indian as described in the Indian Act, to be looked over, to be talked to, the paternalism that existed, that’s what made me know that was how I was viewed,” she said. It was for this reason that she used the word “Indian” in the title of her book, which hit the shelves earlier this week, with an excerpt being made public on the weekend. Trudeau faced questions about Wilson-Raybould’s tell-all book on the campaign trail. He insisted that the issue had already been dealt with as part of the 2019 election campaign. At that time Wilson-Raybould ran successfully as an independent and the Liberals were elected to form a minority government. Prior to the August 2021 election call, Wilson-Raybould was vocal that, in her opinion, it was not the right time to go to the polls. It would be a distraction, she said, from too many ongoing issues that needed to be worked through by a sitting government, including the uncovering of graves on residential school sites by Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc and Cowessess First Nation, and the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Wilson-Raybould is not seeking a third term. “Making the decision to leave that role (of MP), which I do still value, it was because of the nature of Parliament, the partisanship that has become … toxic, that it was my time to leave that space. That’s not to say that I’m not going to continue to be in public service, but to find a place where my actions and my advocacy can be more useful,” she said. Prior to running as an MP, Wilson-Raybould was active in politics, including serving as Assembly of First Nations Regional Chief for British Columbia. “I’d been a passionate advocate for rights recognition for self-determination, including self-government. And part of that creating space for Indigenous nations to rebuild is to get rid of the Indian Act. I am going to continue to speak out and write about that,” she said. Pressure needs to be brought to bear on the federal government to create a mechanism that allows First Nations to get out from under the Indian Act when nations have put in place their own core institutions of government, she says. “That is a mission that I am on, and so many others, to ensure that Indigenous nations can rebuild and in rebuilding we build a stronger country. I’m looking for a leader, a prime minister, to do what is right and to do the work and create the space for that transformative change. I know that that person will have the support of Indigenous nations across the country,” said Wilson-Raybould. She says she has learned much from her time in federal politics, including the limitations of being “blindly loyal” to a political party or a leader. “The nature of our politics is so partisan now. The best ideas, no matter where they come from, are not necessarily listened to if they don’t fit the idea of the leader or the idea of the unelected people that exist within the prime minister’s office,” said Wilson-Raybould. She says certain issues, such as climate change and Indigenous concerns, must be tackled in a non-partisan fashion. Despite her disappointing experience in Ottawa, Wilson-Raybould still encourages Indigenous people and marginalized people to run. “I understand disillusionment, but I also understand hope. And what I hope to impart is that sense of hope; that by we, as individuals or collectively, speaking out and speaking up and speaking the truth in the face of any potential consequences, we need more of that. We need more people to get involved and speak up. That’s how we create change,” said Wilson-Raybould. Windspeaker.com Subject: Partisanship; Political leadership; Prime ministers"

These stories are not endorsements, but meant to provide information to assist voters, and a record to hold the future government accountable. Despite being the party that triggered Canada’s 44th federal election, Justin Trudeau and his Liberals took their time before releasing the party’s platform. Its guiding document was offered to the public on September 1, more than two weeks after the rigour of daily campaigning had begun. Over 91 pages, Trudeau and his team have tried to outline their case for a snap election during a pandemic and explain to voters why they should be given four years of majority rule. The Liberal minority had barely started to work through its legislative agenda when the pandemic threw its two-year term into chaos. The vast majority of political energy was pushed into handling the COVID-19 crisis, meaning key promises made to win the election in 2019 were left untouched. The branding of its 2021 platform hints at continuity. The 2019 document was called Forward: A Real Plan For The Middle Class, changing only slightly this year to read Forward, For Everyone in 2021. Some of the ‘Team Trudeau’ branding has been dropped this time around, perhaps an acknowledgement the party’s leader isn’t as popular compared to the days when he reached international celebrity status."

"2021-09-18","Full text: Town of Stettler council restored the mayor and council’s salary lost to a tax hike brought in several years ago by the federal government. The increase was approved at the Sept. 7 regular meeting of council. Councillors heard a report presented by Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Greg Switenky which noted the subject of mayor and council pay raises is brought up prior to every election and, if approved, takes effect after the election. He stated council was actually approving a pay increase for the next council, not necessarily themselves. Switenky also stated the pay raise was actually more of an adjustment, as the mayor and council saw a cut in their salary a few years ago as a result of a federal government department. The report stated the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) previously allowed about a third of a municipal politician’s salary to be collected tax free; then effective 2019 the CRA changed their policy and began taxing all of a municipal politician's income. In effect, this CRA move cut the mayor and council’s salary. “Back in late 2018 the Town of Stettler council decided that (in the interim of the term) they would not increase council remuneration, rather mutually agreed to each personally absorb this resulting extra taxation,” stated the staff memo. “The ultimate decision was left until prior to the next election.” The CAO stated the mayor is paying $3,070 more per year in taxes and each councillor is paying $1,643. To restore the mayor and council to their previous salaries they would require an increase of $4,093 and $2,191 respectively adding up to $17,500 in the 2022 budget. Switenky noted town staff also surveyed a number of other municipalities and it appears Stettler’s council gets paid roughly what other communities pay their council; the mayor’s salary is consistent with other mayors at $35,655 per year while councillors in Stettler appear to get paid slightly less than comparable communities at $17,828 per year. If the increase was approved, the mayor’s salary would increase to $40,036 and councillor’s to $20,018. The staff report also noted councillors get paid a rate for things like travel. Coun. Malcolm Fischer stated the CRA decision has cost him $1,600 per year and felt that restoring, but not increasing, councillor pay was proper. Coun. Al Campbell stated the feedback he’s heard from the community is the mayor and councillors salaries are getting “...right up there price-wise.” Campbell stated he hesitated to restore the lost pay. Fischer stated he felt councillors would earn that $20,018 per year and because he wasn’t planning on running for re-election, this decision wouldn’t affect him and thus made a motion to approve increasing the mayor’s and councillor’s salaries as noted. Fischer added that in 10 years he has never heard residents complain that council gets paid too much. Mayor Sean Nolls, noting council pay raises are usually linked to the town’s Public Works staff raises, stated he also hesitated at approving the increases. “I think it still makes sense,” said Nolls, referring to councillors getting a raise when Public Works staff get raises. Switenky pointed out staff members have never had a huge tax increase placed on them by the CRA in the way councillors did. Coun. Wayne Smith stated candidates before the last municipal election were told council salaries would be at a certain level, then through no fault of their own had some of that taken away. Smith stated he was in favour of restoring it. Coun. Gord Lawlor noted he didn’t have a problem with restoring salaries back to where they were before the tax increase as that helps compensate a business owner on council who is away from their business. Coun. Cheryl Barros noted councillors do a lot more than regular meetings, they have many committee meetings and other work expected of them. Coun. Scott Pfeiffer stated he was in favour of restoring the lost salary but added voting for his own pay raise made him uncomfortable. Councillors approved restoring the council salaries as noted in the staff report. Subject: Raises; Mayors; Councils; Politics; Wages & salaries; Tax increases"
"2021-09-18","Full text: The first day of advance polls at the Virgil arena and the Niagara-on-the-Lake Community Centre were chaotic and disorganized, resulting in long waits and some people leaving without casting a ballot, some residents say. Large numbers of NOTL voters flocked to the polls early to cast ballots and that led to some frayed tempers and angry residents, poll workers said. However, at NOTL's third advance poll location, the Holiday Inn Express in Glendale, no problems were reported. More voters turned out than ever before for the first day of advance polls across the country, Elections Canada official Nathalie de Montigny told The Lake Report. And NOTL was no different. She said that on Friday, 8,093 turned out across the riding, which includes NOTL, Niagara Falls and Fort Erie. In the 2019 federal election, only 5,837 people voted on the first day, she noted. Across the country, this year more than 1.3 million votes were cast on the first day of advance polling, the organization said in a tweet. Niagara advance polls were open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Friday through Monday and by the end of the first three days the riding had 6,000 more votes cast than during the same period for the previous election, she said. Though she outlined several reasons for the delays during the early days of advance polling, Montigny did not use them as an excuse. “We apologize. Elections Canada wants to apologize if there was waiting (and) long lines in some places,” she said. The riding's advance polls were busier than ever before, she said. One problem was the snap election left the organization less time to prepare than for previous elections, she said. NOTLers tend to arrive early or right on time for community events and the early part of the first day of advance polls is traditionally the busiest. “I don’t know if people are eager to vote or they want to make sure they can cast their ballot. Whatever the reason is, there seems to be more people showing up on the first day,” Montigny said in an interview Monday. Montigny said some of the long wait times were simply a product of bad timing. “We do not control the amount of people that are showing up and when they show up,” she said. Montigny was reluctant to blame the long wait times on COVID-19 precautions but did say the process was slightly slowed down due to the extra steps required. Elections Canada workers have had to gather names and phone numbers for every voter for contact tracing, she said. It was also difficult for the organization to prepare for a snap election as opposed to a fixed date election. This election was given the shortest legally allowed time span to run — only 36 days. One area where this affected Elections Canada was hiring workers. “It’s been a particular challenge during this election because of the pandemic and because of the fact that it’s a short election,” Montigny said. On voting day, Elections Canada becomes one of the biggest employers in the country, with roughly 250,000 Canadians working to oversee the democratic process, she said. NOTL resident Steve Hardaker voted in Glendale at the Holiday Inn Express. He said he had no issues. “We waited for about 15 minutes. One lady who voted before us said she waited 35 minutes. People in our neighbourhood who voted Saturday morning said there was no wait,” Hardaker told The Lake Report. Kaspar Pold, 80, left his advance poll in Virgil due to the long wait and said the polling station was not accommodating for seniors. “My wait out in the sun was about 20 minutes and had to be standing. There were no chairs for older people,” Pold said in an email. When he got to the front doors he was told the wait inside was about another hour. “I couldn’t believe that so I asked some questions and became quite agitated,” Pold said. He said an Elections Canada worker told him the wait was because there was only one polling station set up inside the arena due to COVID-19 safety precautions. Pold said he and others left instead of waiting in the long line. Similar concerns were echoed by Greg Chapman in a Facebook post to the group NOTL 4 ALL. “I’m glad I got my mom a mail-in ballot,” he said after noting the lack of chairs available for seniors. In a comment on his Facebook post Chapman said he waited for over an hour to vote. George Robinson commented that he waited 65 minutes. “There HAS to be a better way!” Chapman commented. Cathy Franklin commented that the experience was a ""nightmare"" and said there was no sanitizer and people not wearing masks. NOTL resident Peter Rider was fed up with the complaints. “Are we not still in a pandemic … still taking precautions because of COVID???” Rider commented on the post. “This has got nothing to do with politics as some might think or lack of organization. It’s advanced voting, during a health crisis.” Hardaker saw the Friday crowds as a good thing. “I think it’s great that people want to vote early. If that means extra wait time then that is OK. COVID restrictions do happen,” he said. Montigny shared a similar sentiment, saying, “In a way, it is good news that people wanted to get out and vote.” Ian and Sharon Gillespie were likewise happy to see the community centre brimming with eager voters. “That’s what we want, a good turnout,” Sharon said in an interview. “The population will speak and we’ll have to see what they say.” The Gillespies both said their biggest concerns this election were the environment and childcare. “We have to provide for the future,” Ian said. NOTL resident Paul Boudreau said his biggest concern this election is COVID-19. Boudreau wanted a strong response to the pandemic and lamented his frustrations with those who refuse to get the vaccine. “I was a firefighter, so this not getting vaccinated I do not understand whatsoever,” he said in an interview on Friday. “I mean, it’s the only way to stop (the pandemic).” He was also frustrated with the Liberals calling an election during the pandemic and that it is costing roughly $600 million of taxpayer money to run. “(Liberals) are screaming about no housing, they’re screaming about no nurses, they’re screaming about no doctors, they’re screaming about old age homes they can’t pay for — and we’re spending ($600 million on the election),” Boudreau said. Boudreau said he would be supporting the Conservatives. Over the weekend, and on Monday, Sept. 13, the lines had all but abated. There was a small lineup outside of the community centre around noon Monday, but everyone said they had been waiting no more than five minutes before entering the community centre. Darrell Boer was waiting in line and said his biggest election issue has always been government spending. “I’m afraid for the future for my kids,” Boer said.

"2021-09-18","Full text: The economy, health and oil are three pillars of public concern according to a virtual forum for Grande Prairie–Mackenzie ahead of the federal election Sept. 20. The forum was hosted by Grande Prairie and District’s Chamber of Commerce’s (GPDCC) last Tuesday. CPC Chris Warkentin, PPC Shawn McLean, Rhino Donovan Eckstrom, Maverick Ambrose Ralph and NDP Jennifer Villebrun were in attendance. Liberal candidate Dan Campbell was absent. GPDCC chair Larry Gibson moderated the night of questions that gave the candidates a chance to tell the public their platforms and solutions on issues federally and locally. “I think that it's time for us to get this country back on track,” said CPC incumbent Chris Warkentin. “We need a government that will impose serious penalties on politicians who break the law and put an end to special deals and contracts for politically connected Ottawa insiders. “I need your help to help elect the Conservative government that will focus on rebuilding our economy and make life more affordable for every Canadian.” NDP candidate Jennifer Villebrun said she believes it’s time for new representation in Ottawa. “I believe that we need new leadership in this community; what I will commit to is that I will be here in the community. “We're a community working with you to meet the goals set out by the NDP, and our platform is solidly based on investing in the people of this community. Our greatest asset is our hard-working people.” “At the end of the day, what everyone is worried about is how they're going to make sure that their family is able to meet their basic needs and how they can get ahead in the world. “Please join me in helping support the NDP in creating a government that is going to invest in people first and ensure that we can pass a positive situation on to our children.” Shawn McLean, PPC candidate, has his sights on freedoms. “The real choice we have in this election isn't liberal or conservative; it's globalism or freedom, and really, we need freedom,” said McLean. “I have had people coming up to me, telling me that they are concerned with where they're going. “A lady yesterday talked to me about how her daughter is going to lose her job with a particular company because she won't get vaccinated, and she doesn't want to. “We need to bring our people together and, as a voice, shut down this globalism that's killing our country.” “The People's Party of Canada is going to take care of the country by basically cutting down the funding of the CBC and foreign aid packages.” Donovan Eckstrom, Rhino candidate, explained that his party is satirical. “We are going to be your option for a protest vote when it comes to figuring out what the heck should we vote for,” said Eckstrom. “The fact is that there are over 20,000 folks here in beautiful Grande Prairie-Mackenzie, who didn't vote in 2019, and I'm aware that a lot of them are frustrated with everybody involved. “I encourage you if you want to give a middle finger for the established parties that are around, vote Rhino.” Maverick party candidate Ambrose Ralph said the large area of the GP-Mackenzie has not been properly represented. “Maverick is a western-only federal party western agenda first, no exceptions. “Honestly, and not to be rude, but I really don't give a damn how the East and Quebec vote any longer. It's time for the West to stand on our own two feet and say enough is enough,” said Ralph. “We were born out of the frustration experienced by Western Canadians at the favouritism shown toward Quebec and toward eastern Canada by consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments on issues like the Paris Climate Accord, farming, gun control, equalization, property rights, carbon tax and our oil and gas industry.” On the topic of privatized health care, the candidates’ views varied. “I believe in the Canada Health Act first, and obviously it must be a system by which every person who can access healthcare, no matter who they are or what they make across the country,” said Warkentin. “What (CPC recognizes) is that there have been innovations that have been developed by provinces obviously healthcare does fall into the provincial jurisdiction; what we will not do is impose an Ottawa-knows-best solution to Alberta or other provinces with regards to their plans,” he added. “NDP has always been an advocate for a publicly funded health care system, and that has not changed,” said Villebrun. “We are against the creeping threat of privatization and user fees being adopted in our healthcare system.” The PPC say they would vote for a shrinking federal government with less provincial overreach, said McLean. “The PPC plans on transferring the GST to provinces so that they can utilize those funds in order to be able to better serve their community and their healthcare industry.” Eckstrom says a Rhinoceros government will “eliminate waiting rooms to speed up wait times; as well, with the difficulties of doctor and nurse shortages, our government will provide steroids to all healthcare employees to increase performance.” Maverick candidate Ralph noted that healthcare is a provincial responsibility, and it was time that the federal government stopped infringing on provincial jurisdiction. “It's a provincial responsibility. We have lineups at our health care facilities, and we have lineups at our hospitals to immediately stop this all we got to do is spend our own money on ourselves. “Hire more nurses and more doctors. The past 11 years, we have spent $250 billion that we have sent to Ottawa to support Quebec and to support eastern Canada,” said Ralph. Of oil and gas… Do you believe that Canada can have a thriving oil and gas sector and a robust renewable sector, and how do you see the two intersecting? “We truly believe in the power of a pipeline, we're thinking more towards the ability of using a beer-powered pipelines, and beer-powered vehicles that way too it would be kind of fun to just stop by the gas station,” responded Eckstrom. “It's absolutely impossible to have a thriving oil and gas sector in this region while we are signed on to the Paris Climate Accord,” said Ralph. “We should withdraw from it immediately and put jobs back in this community.” Meanwhile, Warkentin says, “I would suggest that the renewable sector only can exist because of the oil and gas sector.” “The innovations that have happened throughout the industry over the last number of decades make us a leader in the world in terms of energy developed, and in terms of reducing emissions and creating efficiencies that never existed before.” NDP's Villebrun sees it differently. “I absolutely believe that they can be balanced and I think that they should be, and it's my perspective that in the past we haven't achieved that goal. “We also have to face the reality that the oil and gas needs in the world have been changing. We can look at the vehicle industry and recognize that many prominent companies are advising they'll be a completely electric fleet within the next 10 to 20 years.” McLean said, “the problem we've got with our oil and gas industry is the way the government in the past has basically utilized it where we're bringing in oil from Saudi Arabia.” “We need to have our own oil and gas system up here, and the oil and gas system is a big component in the renewable sector.” Candidates were also asked about their platforms on the economy. Warkentin said his priorities were “rebuilding the economy, and then balancing the budget within 10 years, making sure that we make responsible decisions to ensure that Canadians will not have to see massive tax increases to pay for the last number of years we must reverse some of the excessive spending.” “The NDP has a plan to increase taxes with respect to the ultra-rich,” said Villebrun. “People who make over $10 million annually would be subject to a one per cent tax increase. “What that means for them is they would pay about an extra $10,000 a year, so when you're looking at a $10 million income, that's not a huge amount, but the benefits of it would easily top $10 billion.” “I think People's Party account is the best platform point on this one,” said Mclean, “we get rid of the CBC, there's a billion dollars there, we would cut our foreign spending and focus it on Canadians, then we would stop doing the corporate bailouts.” “(Our policy is citizens first, foreign countries last, no exceptions,” said Maverick’s Ralph. “We could easily fix our deficit in Western Canada by ending equalization, we send billions of dollars east every year, and we don't get nothing in return.” Liberal candidate told the News the reason for his absence at the forum was due to not being invited. GPDCC said that they contacted the Liberal party and received no communication back and could not find Campbell’s contact information. “There is never any intention of excluding a candidate,if they are on the ballot we try to get a hold of them to participate, we had hoped doing the forum virtually this year would have made it even easier for all candidates to take part,” said GPDCC in an emailed response.

"2021-09-18","Full text: Local candidates from the four main political parties were invited to take part in a debate on environmental issues concerning the riding of Simcoe-Grey. The event was sponsored by GreenPAC, a national non-partisan, non-profit organization working to build environmental leadership and government action on the environment. It was held online on Wednesday, September 8. The debate was monitored by Penny Skelton – a Collingwood Rogers Cable TV show host and local resident. Liberal candidate Bren Munro, NDP candidate Lucas Gillies, and Green Party candidate Nick Clayton, all participated. Conservative incumbent, Terry Dowdall, declined the invitation stating that his “schedule will not permit him to participate.” The discussion followed several topics and had a heavy emphasis on climate change. The candidates were asked a series of questions that they had received in advance. That was followed by a series of questions from the public, that were posed to the candidates during the broadcast. T he candidates were asked if they would consider using mandatory measures to combat climate change and which measures would they support. Ms. Munro said the Liberal party has set an emission reduction target of “40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels, by the year 2030.” Mr. Clayton cited wildfires and warming temperatures as proof of a climate change emergency, adding the Green Party will “shut the door on the oil and gas industry in Canada.” NDP candidate Mr. Gillies said the “majority of pollution is caused by major corporations” adding “mandatory measures will force these corporations to reduce pollutants including plastics and toxins from their production.” When asked what they would do to prevent SimcoeGrey agricultural lands from over development, the candidates responded with several suggestions. Mr. Clayton said the Green Party would “partner with the province and municipalities through the official plan that would end vehiclecentric urban sprawl in favour of mixed density walkable neighbourhoods.” M r. Gillies said towns should be building “up instead of out. We need to prioritize local development and classification of local land for development.” Ms. Munro said she would work with local municipalities in cleaning up local environmental problems. The Canadian Environmental Protection act has not been significantly amended since 1999. Candidates were asked if they would support a new bill to amend the act and make it a priority. Mr. Gillies responded, “having updated and enforceable legislation around toxins will be important locally, such as the water issues in Tottenham.” Ms. Munro said “we need to get this bill passed and we are open to improving the bill. We are [requiring] that consumer products such as cosmetics and cleaning products give people the information they need.” Mr. Clayton said the Green Party would “prioritize legislation to modernize the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, enshrining in law the right to a healthy environment for all Canadians. That’s access to clean air, land, food, and water.” The candidates were asked how they would support young people in their quest for a cleaner environment and sustainable world, and how would they give them hope? Ms. Munro replied the Liberals are looking at “every possible way to reduce carbon emissions,” adding that they are looking for “climate friendly fuels.” She said a group of young Liberals will be marching during the United Nations Climate Week in New York. Mr. Clayton said “The youth voice is what motivated me. To the youth, I say, you cannot count on people who are in power. I’m sitting here because you pushed me. What we do now - we have to consider what happens seven generations down the line.” Mr. Gillies said the NDP would “provide free postsecondary education with emphasis on stem research, and engaging youth and championing their local projects and protecting the space where they live and grow.” The debate then switched to question from the public that were posed to the candidates with no advance knowledge of the content. The first question asked what the political parties would do to protect the Great Lakes and waterways within Simcoe County? Mr. Clayton said the Green Party would provide “infrastructure upgrades” and have “less paved areas and more green space to absorb water,” as well as move to a “different model of agriculture,” with less chemicals running off into the water. Mr. Gillies said, the NDP would “protect water and work with the fisheries” but yielded the rest of his time. Ms. Munro, said the Liberals are trying to “restore the Great Lakes which provide one in four Canadians with clean drinking water. A re-elected Liberal government will strengthen the fresh water action plan,” and “collaborate with provincial, territorial, and indigenous, partners to better protect and manage Canada’s fresh water.” The candidates were then asked what bold action they would do to reduce carbon emissions and over-heating of the planet. Mr. Gillies responded “the New Democratic has a very bold climate action plan that includes reducing emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and zero percent by 2050,” adding “carbon free electricity by 2030.” Ms. Munro said “Climate change continues to threaten our supply of fresh water. The bold action I’m thinking of is we have to work together. It cannot be partisan (issue).” Mr. Clayton said the Green Party is “proposing a non-partisan council advisory on climate and doing it at all levels of government.” The debate will be rebroadcast on Collingwood Rogers Cable TV on the days leading up to the election.

"2021-09-18","Full text: Beaverlodge is expected to have an election for the first time in years, says Jeff Johnston, Beaverlodge chief administration officers (CAO). The municipal election is set for Oct. 18. Nominations close Monday at noon. “We're trending to have an election,” Johnston said. If all the nomination papers are in and fees paid in time, there could be seven people running a seat in the table in Beaverlodge, said Johnston. There are six councillors to be elected. Interest hasn’t been as brisk across the board. Beaverlodge, Wembley and Sexsmith all currently only have one nomination each for the mayoral candidacy. As of past Monday, neither Sexsmith or Wembley had enough nominations for a full council. That said, administration has acknowledged some sitting councillors hadn’t filed nomination papers yet, with approximately one week before deadline. “In the event that the number of nominations filed is less than the number of vacancies in the municipality, the returning officer will be available to receive nominations the next day from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.,” according to Alberta Municipal Affairs. “This process continues for up to six business days until an adequate number of nominations are received.” In prior years nomination day was left to a single day; this year nominations open in January. said Alberta Municipal Affairs. Local administrators are getting creative in sparking interest in civic politics. Beaverlodge, Sexsmith and Wembley have promoted the election using newsletters, Facebook pages, town websites and newspaper ads. The Town of Sexsmith actively reached out to prospective candidates and CAO Rachel Wueschner said that she’s had some meetings with people interested in the process looking for more information. “I will meet with them and walk through the process, and just give them some insight on what the role is and that sort of thing,” she said. Wueschner had asked council Sept. 7 to consider temporary signage to entice residents to enter nomination papers. Council voted against it, largely citing precedent. Noreen Zhang, Wembley CAO, said some residents have come and picked up nomination packages, but when the News spoke to her this past Monday few had yet returned to make it official. Staffers promoted the election and support for residents to submit their nominations via the town website, Facebook page and community posters. “(Being a town councillor) is certainly is very rewarding because you do have do have a say of how your community is going to move forward,” said Zhang. Meanwhile, in Beaverlodge, CAO Johnston concurs. “I encourage anybody interested in running for council to do so, and I'm happy to speak with anybody that has questions about the process or concerns about the town,” said Johnston. All nine divisions in the County of Grande Prairie have at least one nomination as of press time. There is one candidate in Division 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8. There are three candidates in Division 2, 4 and 9. Watch next week’s Town & Country News for a complete list of candidates across the South Peace. Anyone interested in running in their municipal election has until Monday noon to submit nomination papers to the returning officer of their municipality. Interested parties can find nomination forms at town offices and by accessing the Municipal Affairs website at www.alberta.ca/municipal-election-forms.aspx A $100 fee must also be paid with submitting the nomination forms. The incumbent must be at least 18 years or older, a Canadian citizen and be a resident of your constituency for six months immediately preceding nomination day.

"2021-09-18","Full text: Hinton’s residents can head to the polls during advanced voting days on Oct. 4, 7, 13, or election day on Oct. 18. The earliest advanced voting day was added to the upcoming municipal election in Hinton to provide residents with ample time to get their votes in. Due to COVID-19 and the rising number of infections locally, council wanted to make sure that as many eligible voters have a chance to cast their ballot despite possible quarantine and isolation periods. They hope that having an advance polling date as early as Oct. 4, two weeks before the official election, will help. They did note that this date will only be utilized if possible with the timelines of when ballots arrive from Elections Alberta. “If you have to isolate for 10 days, [an earlier advanced voting date] could help mitigate. If you’re not available on Oct. 3, Oct. 18 is 15 days, it gives you more likelihood of being able to self-isolate and then vote. The 11 days is right at the threshold of isolation,” Mayor Marcel Michaels suggested. Council confirmed the institutional voting stations at Pine Valley Lodge and the Hinton Continuing Care Centre to provide voting opportunities to electors who might not be able to vote otherwise. Both institutions agreed to have election staff present at their facilities for the municipal, senate, and referendum balloting. Acting CAO Laura Howarth noted that the Town has never provided special ballots in the past and council did not provide direction on special ballots for this election. Special ballots are used in situations where electors are unable to vote during advance voting or at the voting station on election day due to physical disability or absence from the local jurisdiction. Administration recommended that the Town of Hinton forego offering Special Ballots for the 2021 Municipal Election since changes to the Local Authorities Election Act (LAEA) mean the time between nomination deadline to election day went from six weeks to four weeks. The Senate vote and the provincial referendum and ballots will be shipped by the first week in October, which reduces the time frame for sending and receiving special ballots to less than three weeks. Administration claims organizing special ballots within this timeline is unachievable. Howarth noted that the Town will still provide transportation for people to the polling stations. With an isolation period of 10 days, council decided that an additional advanced voting day would allow more time for all citizens to vote. Maguhn voiced concern about the advanced voting day occurring any earlier than Oct. 4. The nomination deadline is Sept. 20, which means late candidates have less time to campaign prior to the first voting day a week and a half later. Administration clarified that polling stations will have masks, barriers, and all protective equipment in place. Subject: Nominations; Councils; Referendums"

"2021-09-18","Full text: Affordability became the hot topic on the campaign trail as inflation hit a nearly two-decade high. Statistics Canada reported yesterday morning that prices increased by 4.1 per cent in August compared with the same month one year earlier, fuelled by rising consumer demand and supply-chain constraints for many goods. Federal party leaders sought to defend why their spending plans as the clock ticks down to Monday's election. N-D-P Leader Jagmeet Singh and Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole say inaction from the Trudeau Liberals is to blame for rising prices -- especially in the housing sector. The Canadian Real Estate Association says the national average home price is expected to reach 680-thousand-dollars this year, up 20 per cent from last year. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says his platform will tackle affordability with hefty housing and child-care measures. A Scotiabank analysis of federal election campaign platforms finds the spending plans from each party could put more pressure on prices and interest rates. --- Subject: Prices"

"2021- 09-18","Full text: There were moments of terse jabs, but overall Wednesday night's all-candidates meeting remained civil and ended with mutual support for the riding’s best candidate, whomever that may be. Six candidates running to replace long-time Simcoe North MP Bruce Stanton made presentations and responded to pre-submitted questions to a virtual Zoom audience, as hosted and moderated by the Southern Georgian Bay Chamber of Commerce. In attendance were Krystal Brooks (Green Party of Canada), Adam Chambers (Conservative Party of Canada), Janet-Lynne Durnford (New Democratic Party of Canada), Russ Emo (Christian Heritage Party), Stephen Makk (People’s Party of Canada), and Cynthia Wesley-Esquimaux (Liberal Party of Canada). Peter Kostiw, president of the SGBCC and moderator for the hour-long meeting, reminded the public that, “the purpose is to enlighten us on the positions of the candidates rather than to debate the issues.” Four pre-selected questions were posed for each candidate to answer in two-minute limits, with everyone adhering tightly to the set rules. 1: Do you believe that humans caused global warming?"
"2021-09-18","Full text: Canada’s four major parties have made strong promises when it comes to furthering reconciliation. Ending boil water advisories, implementing all 94 Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s calls to action, advancing self-determination, and investing in affordable housing and mental health support were all items at the top of the list for North Shore candidates. For Mike Simpson, Green Party of Canada candidate for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country, advancing reconciliation in Canada, “starts with the truth.” “We have to implement the 94 calls to action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, of which 15 or so have actually been implemented [completed],” he said. “The truth part of ‘Truth and Reconciliation’ is the first step. I've heard this time and again, from Indigenous people. They want people to know what happened in residential schools. They want the history to be recognized.” The Greens are committed to “Reconciliation, Nation-to-Nation engagement and self-determination for Indigenous Peoples,” according to the party’s platform. The party also promises to end boil-water advisories by investing in and upgrading infrastructure, ensure all Indigenous people have educational opportunities, to educate non-Indigenous people on First Nations history and culture and to support health-care services that incorporate traditional practices. Simpson said the Greens would “champion” getting Indigenous people into positions “where they can actually determine their own futures.” “What we actually want are Indigenous people in power and making decisions themselves, which is at the core of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous people and self-determination,” he said. Similarly, Kelsey Shein, Conservative Party of Canada candidate for Burnaby North-Seymour, said the Conservatives “believe in building a true partnership, to ensure a just and secure place for thriving, self-determined Indigenous nations within the fabric of Canada.” “We want immediate action on calls to action from the TRC, 71 to 76, and then we want to work with Indigenous leaders to come up with a plan to implement the rest,” Shein said. ""This is a must do.” Shein, who is a proud member of British Columbia's Métis Nation, said the next piece she was passionate about rectifying was making clean water available to all Indigenous communities. “Our party will recognize clean water as a fundamental human right,” she said. “We will fight to resolve the long-term boil advisories across Canada. It’s a national shame that we don't have clean drinking water for all Canadians, and we need a government who will take action on this.” The Conservatives have also made a commitment to invest $1 billion into mental health for Indigenous people, with guidance from First Nations groups and people. Shein added the Conservatives are also going to be working on a “for Indigenous by Indigenous strategy” on housing. “We want Indigenous people to not only have a stake in these conversations but really to be the guiding force of how we should approach some of Canada's most complex issues,” she said. “I believe a lot of our solutions really exist in our ancestral knowledge, and so to ensure that we're listening to Indigenous people as partners, is going to be key to driving those issues forward.” Coming from an Aboriginal law background and having worked with First Nations across the province with Ratcliff and Co. (legal services), Patrick Weiler, Liberal Party of Canada incumbent for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country, said reconciliation was something he “felt strongly about” and it was “frustrating” when NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said they’ve “done nothing in this space.” “We've done so much,"" he said. ""Just in terms of infrastructure, under [former prime minister Stephen] Harper, we were only spending about 11 billion a year on Indigenous priorities. Today, we're now doing almost two and a half times that.” He highlighted that one of the most important pieces of legislation passed this year was the UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act into Canadian law. “We have an action plan over three years to really implement this that's going to require a whole of government approach,” he said. The Liberals will also invest $2 billion toward an Indigenous Urban, Rural, and Northern Housing Strategy and commit an additional $1.4 billion toward mental health. Other priorities include actions to confront systemic racism – especially in the justice system and health care – and protecting the well-being of children and families. “We're going to be co-developing a number of plans, which really is the way forward,” Weiler said. “Ideally, getting to some of the situations like we're seeing with the shíshálh (Sechelt) Nation, where they've been able to move toward self-governance agreements.” While the Liberals didn’t meet their March deadline to end all long-term boil water advisories as previously promised, Weiler said they were “very close to getting to that end point,” with 116 now lifted. There are still 51 long-term drinking water advisories, according to Indigenous Services Canada. “All the remaining ones we see across the country are now actually being built or just waiting for approval to have that advisory lifted,” Weiler said. The Liberals have also committed $321 million to support First Nations in uncovering burial sites at residential schools and to help with the trauma associated. “We need to be able to uncover the full truth,” Weiler said. Tammy Bentz, New Democrats Party candidate for North Vancouver, said to start, “we have to uphold Indigenous rights and advance self-determination” by fully implementing the UN Declaration of Rights of Indigenous peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 calls to action. Among a long list of commitments, New Democrats have also promised to address the Indigenous housing crisis by implementing a co-developed, fully funded Indigenous National Housing Strategy within their first 100 days in office. They also say they will invest in children and end funding discrimination, and close education and health gaps, as well as address the harms of residential schools. Bentz said it was “inexcusable” that there are still Indigenous communities that do not have drinking water available to them, adding that the NDP would invest in infrastructure and programs that would “end the divide.” “Everything from education to housing, to health care,” she said. “Because drinking water is just a starting point to us, that’s the very, very least that we do, and we do it now,” she said. “Upholding Indigenous knowledge, respecting inherent sovereignty – this is what we want to start with.” Bentz added that focusing on relationships was key to moving forward. “We have to build a better relationship than we've had,” she said. “I want to start with me, I want to make sure that people feel heard and feel represented.” The big platform of the NDP is that we don't leave anyone behind, said Bentz. “And, of course, our Indigenous people are at the forefront of that, because they've been left behind for so long.” Subject: Drinking water; Mental health; Infrastructure; Native rights; Native North Americans; Elections; Reconciliation"
"2021-09-18","Full text: Deep River -- For the Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke New Democratic Party riding association and candidate Jodie Primeau, every vote counts and if enough voters flip to the NPD the riding could turn orange. “The campaign is going phenomenally,” she said on Tuesday afternoon. “I thought I would do well, but we are getting blue votes flipping over.” Citing a poll by CommAdvantage, a private education firm, which showed if all voters in the riding cast their ballot, the NDP candidate had a strong possibility as an upset. While in most elections not all voters cast a ballot, the local campaign is hoping for a strong showing this election. “In fact, if 2,000 youth vote NDP and 5,880 former conservative voters flip to the NDP, Jodie Primeau will win,” predicts Doulton Wiltshire, CEO of CommAdvantage. “Don’t give up – show up.” According to a release from the NDP, the poll found Ms. Primeau is running a tight campaign with the strongest ground game anyone has put up against incumbent Cheryl Gallant, the Conservative candidate, in 20 years. They state the NDP candidate has the potential to win if everyone who wants change and real leadership at the federal level shows up on election day and votes for Ms. Primeau. Describing herself as a progressive candidate, she said she is really pleased to see the reception her campaign has been receiving across the riding. Not only are some Conservative and Liberal voters shifting to the NPD, but there is a strong resonance with young people. “This year in particular they are looking for an inclusive, accessible candidate,” she said. Easily one of the most visible candidates in the election, Ms. Primeau was at the Renfrew Fair on the weekend and has been doing ""pop-up"" stops around the riding during a campaign which has been very unusual due to COVID restrictions. She also has participated in a variety of question and answer times dealing with local issues and was looking forward to a debate this week. Running a very high energy campaign, this is very similar to her life. She runs a successful law practice in Deep River, is a single mom of a young daughter and a competitive triathlete. She noted she is able to run with the support of her work colleagues, campaign team and nanny, to name a few. “By working together as a team, we are making the impossible happen,” she said. Having fun on the campaign trail has been part of her mantra and many of her pictures show her hamming it up, but there is another side to her. “I’m also very stubborn, competitive and dedicated,” she said. In meeting people in the riding, she has seen they are concerned about the Ottawa Valley not falling behind and they are worried this is happening with the current representation federally. “Seniors find the other parties don’t speak to their issues of affordability,” she said. Students are telling her they want a positive world which deals with climate action, she said. “And people don’t want to be left behind in finding a health provider,” she said. As well, as she juggled with the uncertainties of cell service while chatting to the Leader, she said accessible, affordable cell service is crucial in our area. As part of her campaign, she has addressed issues which affect the area including access to medical care, support for the military and veterans and support for AECL, including the re-nationalization of those assets at Chalk River.

"2021-09-18","Full text: Manitoulin Island resident Sarah Gabrielle Baron on is taking on leader of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), Erin O’Toole, as an independent candidate in the riding of Durham, Ontario. Part of the reason she chose that riding was to use the platform to bring small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) into the election conversation. Ms. Baron is a vocal opponent of SMRs, and Durham is home to the Darlington nuclear generating station and next door to Pickering. Once she began knocking on doors and speaking to residents, her goals quickly changed. Her platform has a strong focus on climate change and social justice issues and she credits the resilience of Manitoulin communities in guiding her vision. Just days before the writ was dropped, Ms. Baron learned there were some anomalies reported in hydrogen levels in the cooling tubes in the Pickering and Bruce nuclear generating stations. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission did take it seriously but in her opinion, they didn’t take it seriously enough. “That was one of the main reasons I just got in my car and drove to Durham and started collecting signatures. Then I started hearing some of the things that Erin O’Toole was saying.” Mr. O’Toole wants to abolish the CBC, refuses to denounce conversion therapy and “it’s like the climate crisis isn’t really happening for the Conservative Party of Canada,” Ms. Baron said. “On my first day of collecting signatures, Erin O’Toole said ‘raise the flag.’ Mr. O’Toole commented that he would re-raise Canadian flags on September 30 as a sign of commitment to reconciliation. Flags have flown at half-mast at federal buildings, including the Peace Tower, since May 30 following the discovery of unmarked graves on former residential school grounds. That comment was “astounding and heartbreaking, callous and cruel,” she said. “I consider myself an ally to Indigenous nations,” she added. “My degree is in politics and Indigenous studies. My teaching degree was through the Aboriginal Teachers Education Program at Kenjgewin Teg. Half of my students or more have been Indigenous. I’ve learned from knowledge keepers like Alan Corbiere and other Anishnabek elders here on the Island. I’m shocked that none of our so-called leaders have the guts to use the word genocide. No one talks about the reality of intergenerational traumatic response.” Ms. Baron’s Indigenous platform is “Truth first, then Reconciliation.” We’re still in the truth stage and Canadian political leaders “clearly do not have a grasp of treaties,” she said. For Mr. O’Toole to speak the way he does and then to have to confront some “pretty serious racism” in that riding has made her proud to include this in her platform. After knocking on more than 600 doors in the riding, she believes that one in five would be very conservative. “I think that Erin O’Toole is overconfident,” she said. The People’s Party of Canada candidate has a lot of signs on lawns (“those are guaranteed votes”) and there is a Rhino party candidate as well, evidence of a split right within the riding. “You don’t have a strong Liberal or Conservative presence down there, so I think three out of every five doors I knocked on were very receptive to me and my message,” Ms. Baron said. “They were receptive to someone running as an Independent. When I was giving the messaging on new nuclear, that was difficult as a lot of them are OPG (Ontario Power Generation) workers but they were willing to engage and some of them were shocked at some of the information I was giving them.” “Facts like the SMR plan for Point Lepreau (in Saint John, NB) has already received (more than) $50 million. Nine non-proliferation experts who have served under six United States presidents have written to Justin Trudeau twice this year begging him not to go ahead with that design. It’s looking like Canada could potentially be ground zero for a nuclear weapons race. The whole idea of these SMRs is to market them around the world.” She pointed to UNDRIP (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) legislation in Canada. “The law in our country says for any land use project to go ahead we need free, prior and informed consent from Indigenous nations and the Anishnabek Nation in conjunction with the Iroquois caucus, way back in 2017, stated clearly that SMRs shall not go ahead on their traditional territories, so to even be talking about it is to break not only national but international law.” “I’m very, very grateful for my Anishinaabek students,” said Ms. Baron. “I’m very, very grateful for the strong Anishinaabek culture, the strong Anishinaabek politics that have really informed my ability to address the type of rhetoric that’s coming from Erin O’Toole.” Some of the rhetoric coming from the right in this election is frightening, she said. “For somebody who may be our future prime minister to say, raise the flag, at the beginning of an election, when at that time we were at 7,000 bodies found in unmarked graves, it worries me.” It’s part of a far right faction that is raising its head again, she noted, and Erin O’Toole is “not going to keep his pro-life ethic and his party on the backbench. He will allow them to come forward on this issue. It will become open again in the next parliament. We need to be prepared for that.” Talking about the climate crisis has resonated with every single person that Ms. Baron has spoken with, including the conservatives. That’s why she decided to place the climate crisis platform first. “It really is the most important question facing Canadians, and in fact all human beings. It is not at the top of the agenda in this election and it really should be. Everything on my platform page evolves from looking at the different issues always through a climate crisis lens. Whether you’re talking about health or housing, any of these issues, if you look at them with a climate crisis lens then the types of solutions that we should be going for changes drastically.” Ms. Baron pledges to cut Canada’s carbon footprint by 60 percent in eight and one half years, with every community developing their own appropriate projects and plans. “Clearly we do not have time to wait for leadership from the federal government,” she said. “Those ideas of resiliency are actually inspired by folks here on the Island.” She mentions the group ‘Resilient Manitoulin’ as just one example. “That kind of community-based resiliency, that whole concept is inspired by what I see on Manitoulin Island. The number of farmers that took advantage of putting in solar when there were feed-in tariffs. They put in this wind farm here on the Island but didn’t have the foresight to put in breakers. We can still install that here on the wind farm, but a lot of that power is actually wasted in transmission. We can still install community-based storage solutions for that power.” “Mark Jacobson (a renewable energy expert and senior fellow at Stanford University) has clearly costed out for 180 countries, including Canada, that with renewables and efficiencies and resiliency-based solutions, we can definitely reduce our carbon footprint in eight-and-one-half years. We can definitely do it. It’s just a matter of political will,” she said. “I started out as a one issue woman,” said Ms. Baron. “It’s called a stunt candidate. After knocking on doors I just felt morally compelled to expand my platform into something that provided a more holistic and more realistic response to everything I see going on in politics today.” Subject: Wind farms; Native peoples; Carbon footprint; Political leadership; Climate change; Reconciliation; Political parties"

"2021-09-18","Full text: If Erin O’Toole’s Conservatives form the next federal government, the Native Women’s Association of Canada says Indigenous women have a long, hard road ahead of them. A scorecard released yesterday by NWAC ranks the platforms of the five main parties based on 11 priorities. The Conservatives received a failing grade of D. “It is quite overwhelming,” said NWAC CEO Lynne Groulx. “But is this something new here, that it's hard for us to get the government moving on such systemic issues and longstanding issues? There is nothing new for us. Our past has always been quite monumental.” She points to a lack of movement by any government on successive reports, including the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996), the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) on the legacy of the Indian residential school system in Canada (2015) and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019). NWAC commissioned Nanos Research to compare the platforms of the parties based on 11 policy issues prioritized by NWAC: The issues were rated on a scale of five and from that determination the scorecard was created. The Conservatives scored ones—the lowest score—in environment and climate change, child welfare, and education because Indigenous peoples were not included in their platform on these topics. In contrast, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals received a score of four in each of these three categories. Overall, the Liberals earned a grade of B. However, Groulx points out that if she were ranking the Liberals on their actions—particularly on the priority of rights of Indigenous women and gender-diverse people—she would not give them a perfect score like Nanos did on this priority in the Liberals’ platform. “(The) Liberals, in terms of their scores on MMIWG, their actual real score based on the work they've done, I wouldn't have given him that score because they were late in coming out with the action plan. The plan is not a plan; it's the pathways, and they're not fully funded. I heard the Prime Minister say it's fully funded and it's not fully funded,” said Groulx. The New Democratic Party’s platform scored the highest, earning a grade of A. The party, led by Jagmeet Singh, received scores of fours and fives on every priority. “I’m not so surprised because I've been watching from the beginning. We've been watching Mr. Singh and his statements and the thoughtfulness behind it and the analysis behind it,” said Groulx, who commends the party for including all 11 priorities outlined by NWAC in its platform. As for the other two main parties, the Bloc Québécois earned a failing grade of D, while the Green Party scored a grade of B. The Bloc scored ones in almost every category except in “self-determination and decision-making” where the party’s platform earned a perfect five. It committed on numerous occasions to abolish the Indian Act and to ensure the government applied the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to enact all the TRC’s Calls to Action. Groulx says the Bloc’s score is “disappointing” and shows that Indigenous women’s issues do not register in its priorities. “Our ultimate goal is finding out where do we need to put some effort in—and it’s not all our responsibility. Reconciliation is not all our responsibility—but now that we know, in particular, where there is a weakness here, there's a problem here and let's take a look at that and have a conversation about it,” said Groulx. Should a minority government be formed, Groulx says the NDP could play a “critical role,” which would be advantageous for Indigenous women. “They could find themselves in a position of power to influence and change legislation and make it more appealing to Canadians, and more favourable… I see them as a bridge builder,” said Groulx. As for a majority government, Groulx is practical: “It has to be the right one and really that hasn't happened yet. There always seems to be something else. There's always another priority. There's always big promises, but the governments have not yet, we haven't seen that yet, really (stepped) up and say ‘This is our priority. We are going to end this genocide here’.”"
"2021-09-17","Full text: The six federal candidates may have ambitious goals, but their minds and hearts reside in the Foothills. From increasing resource production, to making life more affordable, to keeping the ecosystem clean, each contender has a unique plan to help the local economy prosper and to keep residents healthy and happy. Shootin’ the Breeze conducted one-on-one interviews with the candidates to find out what they have planned for the region. John Barlow (Conservative, incumbent) Barlow has set his sights on making living more affordable for Canadians. In the past six years he has been elected three times, once in Macleod and twice in the Foothills riding, and one issue that has continued to burden the public throughout his tenure, he says, is government debt. “The spending of this current Liberal government, the debt they’ve added is more than every prime minister in Canadian history combined,” he says. “That’s pretty staggering. We have seen our debt double and now we’re over $1 trillion in debt. We have to get that under control.” Although in favour of cutting taxes, he says it’s also important to focus on regaining lost revenue, particularly from industries relating to oil and gas. If elected, he would repeal Bill C-69, making it easier for pipelines and similar projects to be approved. He would also focus on regaining agricultural products and natural resources lost to foreign markets in India, China and the European Union. A rural economy cannot thrive without Internet access and Barlow promises to help connect all rural Canadians in the Foothills riding to high-speed internet by 2025. “If we can’t provide it, they’re going to go elsewhere,” he says. “You have farmers now on the cutting edge of technology, using drone technology, satellite technology, marketing their products worldwide. To do those things, they need access to high-speed internet.” Barlow helped facilitate deals that will see high-speed internet introduced to Bragg Creek, Stavely and Blackie in coming months. His next focus will be Cowley. Brett Rogers (Green) Rogers has been working on an international development project for over a decade, which has become the basis for his platform in this election. He describes himself as a lifelong scholar, with a background in quantum science and neuroscience, who is advocating for greater scientific representation in Parliament. He is particularly passionate about genetic and epigenetic testing, and would like to make it widely available to all Canadians to help optimize their lifestyle. He is supportive of both renewable energy and natural resource extraction, believing both can co-exist, but says renewable projects in the Foothills need to be more fully developed to reduce damage to wildlife. He would like to see bird-friendly turbines added in mountain areas with higher winds. While he agrees with the fundamental philosophy of the Green party, he disagrees with some of its policy platforms, including the decision to stop all oil and gas projects and remove all fossil-fuel vehicles from the road by 2030. “Canadian oil is best used in Canada for all applications,” Rogers says. “Instead of contributing to carbon emissions and other pollutants by exporting oil and then importing that oil back as finished products, we can build our economy by making those products at home.” He says electric vehicles should be prioritized in public transportation and construction industries, and for developing nations like Saudi Arabia, China and Brazil, which contribute more to emissions than first-world countries. Green projects he would like to prioritize include the manufacturing of more resource efficient batteries and the capture of electric energy from nuclear waste. Paula Shimp (Liberal) Shimp wants her campaign to reflect her love for the plains, rivers and windy skies of the Foothills, which her family has called home for six generations. She decided to step up and run in the election to advocate against local mining projects, which she says could have devastating effects on local ecosystems. She is particularly concerned by the proposed Grassy Mountain mine and Shimp’s research has led her to believe that Riversdale Resources, which owns the site, has overlooked two key details in its environmental assessment study. One is the impact airborne selenium contamination could have on the $4-billion to $5.5-billion honey bee industry. Alberta is home to 39 per cent of Canada’s honey bee colonies, she says, much of which is located in the Foothills, and contamination could threaten colony survival. She also mentions that more research is needed to identify the impacts of airborne coal dust, which has been found to cause autoimmune disease and cancer, and to lead to infertility in residents living around mines. Shimp has been involved with the Liberal party since 1985, when she served as a political pollster and campaign officer in Calgary. Through the years, she has fed her passion for social outreach by organizing school and heritage group fundraisers, developing school food programs, creating early-childhood community services and volunteering for the Comox Valley Sexual Assault Response Team. She is dedicated to alleviating family poverty, supporting newcomers and vulnerable populations, and strengthening disability programs. If elected, she would help Piikani Nation procure government-funded and private business incentives. Josh Wylie (Maverick) In March, Wylie entered the world of politics for the first time, a decision driven by his frustration with the Conservative party and its partisanship favouring the Eastern provinces. “They end up skewing their policies toward Ontario and Quebec, where the bulk of the voter base is,” he says. “The representatives that we have in our riding are basically dictated to by the party to what they will and will not support.” Under the Maverick party he is campaigning for greater western representation in Parliament. The party, formerly known as Wexit Canada, is made up exclusively of western constituents, who advocate for western independence and constitutional changes that benefit the West. Under its former name, the party advocated for western separatism, but Wylie says the party has been rebranded and, going forward, will focus only on providing a voice for western Canadians. “I’m not a separatist,” he says. “I think we need to increase our provincial autonomy and increase our provincial independence, the same that Quebec did in the ’90s.” To Wylie, this means transferring Alberta taxes, police forces and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan to provincial jurisdiction. This plan, he says, will lower premiums and increase retirement income. Michelle Traxel (NDP) Traxel says her experience as a small business owner in a rural community has given her insight into the issues farmers and shopkeepers face. As the co-owner of Okotoks restaurant Little Fast + Fresh, she faced considerable challenges during the pandemic. Food costs increased by 40 per cent and utility costs tripled, but her business didn’t qualify for financial support because it didn’t lose enough money. If elected, she would advocate for policy change to government loans, so that more small businesses and farmers could qualify for financial support. Traxel departs from the traditional NDP platform on a variety of issues. She is against carbon tax and has proposed carbon sinks as an alternative. Carbon sinks are native grassland areas that capture carbon from the atmosphere and release it into the soil. This land, she explains, could be leased to larger carbon-producing corporations that would pay the government to maintain these areas to offset output costs. Although she disagrees with the Liberal and NDP decision to ban nine types of firearms, she says the NDP has agreed to support her outlook, even if it’s not what the party advocates for. “When I addressed that with my party, we had a really open dialogue. It was very apparent that they were willing to have that conversation and that’s what attracted me to the NDP,” she says. Daniel Hunter (PPC) Hunter entered the federal race in August, but he’s played a behind-the-scenes role in politics for most of his life. Before joining the People’s Party of Canada, he followed the Conservative party closely, supporting it at leadership conventions. If elected, he would reduce government spending by defunding the CBC, cutting funding to United Nations programs, shutting down government initiatives with overlap between federal and provincial jurisdiction, and downgrading administrative affairs to the provincial level. He is particularly concerned with environmental social governance policy, which he says prevents Alberta oil and gas companies from investing and from receiving bank loans. He argues that the western oil industry is more eco-friendly than the foreign buying the government supports. “We are the most ethical oil in the world and companies on the East Coast are buying it from Saudi Arabia and countries that have very problematic policies,” he says.

"2021-09-17","Full text: A band councillor in a northern and remote First Nation says that because of “broken promises” there are children growing up in his community that have never known a time when there has been access to clean drinking water. “What’s sad is that there are young children here, and this is all they have ever known.” Tataskweyak Cree Nation (TCN) band councillor Nathan Neckoway said on Monday, just days before Canadians go to the polls to elect the next federal government. “All we are asking is for the federal government to abide by their own platforms and quit breaking those promises because there is a lot of talk but when it comes to action we don’t see their full action and attention.” Neckoway said he has been keeping a close watch on the federal election campaign leading up to the Sept. 20 election because TCN, a community that sits about 780 kilometres north of Winnipeg and is home to more than 2,000 on-reserve residents, has not had access to clean drinking water since a boil water advisory was put into effect in 2017 after major flooding in the community. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the federal Liberals previously promised in 2015 to end all boil water advisories in Canadian First Nations communities by March 2021, but as March came and went those promises were not kept. Currently in Canada, according to the most recent Government of Canada statistics, there are 51 First Nation communities under boil water advisories, including two here in Manitoba, as well as 41 in Ontario, and six in Saskatchewan. In Manitoba, TCN and Shamattawa First Nation are the two communities under advisories and Neckoway said that in his community they have no sense of when that could change. Neckoway added that so far he has not seen much from the federal candidates that makes him believe there is any urgency to fix the clean water situation in his and other communities. “I watched the federal debate the other night and really The NDP leader was the only one to bring it up, and what that tells me is they are just not committed to it,” Neckoway said. “I just don’t see any urgency or any commitment.” He added the community currently has bottled water delivered and then distributed to homes by the local fire department. “We see short cuts and bandage fixes and solutions, and that’s not right,” Neckoway said. The community is also currently a plaintiff in an ongoing class-action lawsuit against the federal government that was launched in 2019 and seeks to have access to clean drinking water recognized as a basic human right. “We felt the lawsuit was the only step we could take to try and open the eyes of the government and get their attention,” Neckoway said. “We have tried everything else, and community members and this council are very frustrated.” The Winnipeg Sun has reached out to federal Minister of Indigenous Services Marc Miller for comment but has so far not received a response. — Dave Baxter is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the Winnipeg Sun.

Brennan also noted becoming a candidate isn’t something that should be entered into lightly, but for the people that do put their names forward; that’s the importance of having these resources and making them visible to everyone. “It’s not about just promoting women over men, but it's about making sure that there are things for everyone. The resources are all written with diverse groups in mind but they really are for everyone. That’s what's important, the resources are publicly available and we want to help everyone.” There are currently four women on the ballot for this year, and in the 116-year history of Taber, there has only ever been one female mayor. “I think that when we’ve had past women councillors, that it really does serve as almost of a role model for those that are on the fence,” noted Jeanne Rudolf, returning officer. “I don’t know if there’s a particular reason why we have so many women on the ballot this term, but I do support it and it’s nice when women do feel they have something important to say and to offer their community. It doesn’t matter if you’re a boy or girl or what colour you are — you have the right and everyone needs you and your voice. We all need different perspectives throughout our life. Everyone brings something different to the table regardless of who they are. I think these differing perspectives are necessary.” According to a federal study, currently, 28 per cent of council seats in Canada are occupied by females, while only 18 per cent of mayoral seats are occupied by females. If you are looking to put your name in for the municipal election, or are just curious about the resources you can go to taber.ca/election for more information. “We’ve linked many things and anyone who is thinking of putting their name in should go and look at that. Look at every single resource whoever they are written for, look at all of them. Just because the resources are written for certain groups doesn’t mean that valuable information isn’t in there somewhere. They are all publicly available and more information is always better,” said Brennan. “It doesn’t matter if you’re man, women, non-binary or part of any culture. What matters is what you stand for,” added Rudolf. Everyone is encouraged to vote for both the federal and municipal elections, and it will be made as safe as possible. “This year will be a challenge,” mentioned Rudolf. “But we are prepared and want everyone to feel as comfortable as possible.” Subject: Local elections"
"2021-09-17","Full text: KAWARTHA LAKES: Residents of Kawartha Lakes were able to hear their 2021 federal election candidates’ thoughts on a variety of topics, during an all-candidates meeting held in Lindsay on Thursday, September 9th. The meeting was put on by the Lindsay and District Chamber of Commerce and the Frost Student Association. One of the issues discussed was housing affordability. Conservative candidate Jamie Schmale had a couple of actions in mind. “The issue here is on the supply side, in a lot of cases. What we are going to do is free up some spaces. Starting with about 37,000 buildings the federal government has in its portfolio. We’re going to look at that portfolio and then release a minimum of 15 percent of that supply to start creating houses,” he said. “We’re also going to ban foreign home-ownership, those [who] are trying to use Canada as a place to hide their money from other governments or other actors. We’re going to stop that and start to relieve some of that pressure on the demand side.” “Young Canadians aren’t asking for a free house; they’re not asking for a handout. They’re just asking for a little bit of help, and that’s what we want to give them. We have a plan called ‘A Home for Everyone.’ We want to unlock home-ownership, we want to build more homes, and we want to protect the rights of those buying homes,” Liberal candidate Judi Forbes said. NDP candidate Zac Miller said, the NDP plans to have 1.7 million homes created, with 500,000 of them listed as affordable housing. Green Party candidate Angel Godsoe stressed the importance of all Canadians having access to housing. “Of course, the Green Party of Canada will work with all levels of government to promote and support local housing initiatives. We have a housing-first policy and believe safe and affordable housing is a human right. It will be protected by building more affordable housing, increasing funding for more cooperative and supportive housing to be built, [and] ensuring all housing in Indigenous communities is built following principles in the U.N. declaration of rights for Indigenous peoples. The Green Party of Canada is also planning on launching a program on building retrofits.” Libertarian candidate Gene Balfour explained the reason for the housing crisis could be Canadians not having as much disposable income after taxes, as well as “excessive regulations.” People’s Party of Canada (PPC) candidate Alison Davidson cited lowering federal spending, balancing the budget and reducing taxes as ways to help with this issue. The candidates were also asked if they would amend the Canada Health Act to include long-term care, to ensure the sector receives public funding and there are national standards in place. Mr. Balfour opined, the healthcare system is already failing, so it wouldn’t make sense to add more responsibility to the government. Ms. Davidson said the “provinces need the autonomy to innovate and make things work better in their own province.” She added long-term care homes need to follow regulations which are already in place. Ms. Forbes pointed the finger at the Ontario provincial conservative government for the current state of the long-term care sector. “It is important to note the Conservative government’s willingness to stop random reviews of these homes, their reliance on privately owned homes and the total failure of the Ministry of Health to support long-term care homes in this crisis, even with the help offered by the federal government,” she said. Mr. Schmale took exception with that comment. “I do find it interesting that she quickly posted blame at the current provincial government, given the fact, under 15 years of Liberal rule in Ontario, less than 2,500 old age, long-term care facility beds were built, and privatization was expanded,” he said. Mr. Schmale added, the Conservative Party plans to double healthcare transfer funding to the provinces. Mr. Miller said, the NDP has a plan to make all long-term care homes publicly owned. “The first thing we must do is remove for-profit from long-term care. The federal government can do this, first by starting with Revera, which is federally owned. Second, in order to best achieve the [removal] of profit from long-term care, the federal government must legislate an independent act of parliament [which] brings long-term care under the public umbrella. Within this act, national standards can be defined,” he said. Ms. Godsoe said, the Green Party is committed to holding a national inquiry into the long-term care crisis and agreed the federal government must stop for-profit long-term care homes.

"2021-09-17","Full text: It's hard to spot one of the largest ridings in Canada from Ottawa. The race to get more federal attention for Desnethé — Missinippi — Churchill River is shaping up as a showdown over whether longtime northern NDP MLA turned Liberal Buckley Belanger can translate his name into a win over incumbent Conservative Gary Vidal and NDP challenger Harmonie King. Joining the competition is the Green Party's Nasser Dean Chalifoux, the People’s Party of Canada's Dezirae Reddekopp and Independent candidate Stephen King. ""It's always been a challenging riding to represent, and it's one that is quite sharply divided along Indigenous and non-Indigenous lines,"" said Ken Coates, who is a Munk senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and a professor at the Johnson-Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy. ""It's an important riding to look at, but it's also a riding that has not really attracted a lot of federal attention."" The riding accounts for roughly half of the geography of Saskatchewan, stretching from agriculture in its south to remote and Indigenous communities in its north. It's roughly 70 per cent Indigenous and has a median total income of $23,281, according to the 2016 census. It's also rarely partisan. Since its creation in 1996, the Conservatives have elected three MPs, while the Liberals and NDP have each elected two. Belanger's fellow NDP-to-Liberal convert Rick Laliberte has served under both party banners. ""What will make a big difference here is a simple thing. I think it's really uncertain how the Liberal Party will get its vote in 2021,"" Coates said. ""This is a 'cover your mouth and your nose and vote' election."" Vidal previously served as mayor of Meadow Lake — a key stronghold. Area polls including Flying Dust First Nation supplied about 2,000 of the roughly 11,000 votes that landed him his seat in 2019. He's confident about running on his record on Indigenous and northern affairs, pointing to his advocacy ""from east to west, north to south"" on the northern cost of living, mental health support and the softwood lumber industry. However, King — who previously ran in the area for the provincial NDP — is quick to point out she's also from Meadow Lake. If she's able to mobilize NDP voters there, she could counter some of Vidal's support. As a social worker, she argues that her experience on the front lines gives her a unique voice to speak to northern challenges compared to career politicians. ""You typically deal with things that most politicians wouldn't even set foot in. They don't go into the communities and work with the people like I do. That would be the difference,"" she said. It's left to be seen how that connects with voters. Romping through the south as the NDP and Liberals duelled proved a successful strategy for Vidal in 2019 — and Coates expects those conservatives to vote in droves. That's an issue for Belanger, who needs to do well in far northern and Indigenous communities. However, Coates doesn't expect a surge in Indigenous voter turnout during this election. Both King and Belanger are Indigenous, but on-reserve turnout in Saskatchewan fell by roughly 10 points from 67.1 per cent in 2015 to 56.9 per cent in 2019. Similarly, a 2012 study of North Saskatchewan voting found high rates of participation in local politics like band elections, but lower turnout among Indigenous voters when electing candidates to more distant governments in Regina and Ottawa. Recent history also suggests a lower turnout. Saskatchewan's provincial pandemic election saw a slight drop in the overall turnout to 52.86 per cent from 53.5. ""(Belanger's) real challenge is to get it so people in the southern part of the riding see him as being a real contributor to their issues and their concerns, and at the same time making sure the other folks turn out to vote,"" Coates said. Southern support is also on Belanger's mind. In a recent interview, he called the agriculture on the southern edge of the riding a ""vital part of the provincial economy,"" advised against north-versus-south divisions, and added he was hoping to attracting disaffected conservatives as well his former NDP teammates. ""We want to assure people in the southern part of the riding that we will be fair and consistent in how we treat the entire riding,"" he said. Running a high-profile candidate from the northwest like Belanger has worked in the past, but that's no guarantee. The Liberals ran a notable leader out of the northeast with Lac La Ronge Indian Band Chief Tammy Cook-Searson in 2019, but struggled to pull ahead when facing off against Vidal and then-NDP incumbent Georgina Jolibois, who has a strong base of support in the northwest as mayor of La Loche. Cook-Searson finished third with 26.5 per cent of the votes, behind Jolibois (28.4) and Vidal (42.3). Coates sees this round differently. He suggests the federal NDP have struggled to gain traction in Western Canada, despite Leader Jagmeet Singh's efforts to build support with Indigenous voters. That may weaken the challenge from Belanger's left flank. ""More importantly, national parties don't matter in the north like they do elsewhere,"" Coates said. ""It really is a situation where the local person counts an awful lot."" Coates said it's not so much about partisan loyalty, but delivering for an overlooked swath of the province. In his eyes, neither the Conservatives nor the Liberals delivered much to the region with their respective terms in government. ""The political party doesn't matter all that much. (It's) which party is going to deliver."" Subject: Voter behavior"
"2021-09-17","Full text: With the federal election coming up, Cambridge Times and Metroland Media decided to look at the issues dominating the campaign. Here's a local look at pandemic efforts and recovery, and what the federal candidates are promising. Pandemic Efforts and Recovery After being hit hard at the beginning of the pandemic, Waterloo Region mounted an impressive vaccine effort and has distributed over 822,268 doses of the vaccine as of press time. At press time, there were 161 active cases in the region. According to a report by the Workforce Planning Board of Waterloo, Wellington and Dufferin, it could be another year before Waterloo Region sees full economic recovery. This is mainly due to worker shortages, the threat of another lockdown, and low-cash flow amongst businesses that are still adjusting to the new normal. What the parties are promising: Liberals: The party has signed a contract for booster vaccines, and have made vaccines mandatory for all public service workers. The party has also pledged 10 days of paid sick leave for federal workers, money towards improved ventilation in schools and $9 billion to train new personal support workers."
"2021-09-17","Full text: Most Northwest Territories residents need only look down the street to be reminded of one of the territory's biggest crises: the lack of suitable, safe housing. Multiple families crowd into some homes in small N.W.T. communities where there simply aren't enough buildings. Elsewhere, people live in dilapidated houses long overdue for repair or pay some of the priciest rental costs in Canada. There is universal agreement among federal election contenders that fixing N.W.T. housing is an urgent priority. But how? We consulted parties' national platforms and news releases and heard directly from candidates to summarize what each of the five options on the territory's ballot is promising. In a news release on Tuesday, Michael McLeod – seeking a third term as the N.W.T.'s MP – said a re-elected Liberal government would build on investments it has made in northern housing with a new, three-part national housing plan. McLeod said the plan will help make home ownership more accessible by helping renters to become owners, reducing the monthly cost of mortgages, and increasing incentives to help young people buy homes, saving first-time homeowners up to $30,000. The national plan promises to build more homes by doubling a national fund for coinvestment, a practice where the federal government puts up money to help projects that already have some other source of financial backing, such as from the N.W.T. Housing Corporation. The Liberals also propose allocating at least $300 million to Indigenous housing, for which McLeod says he has been ""the leading voice on Parliament Hill."" The party adds it will establish a ""home buyers’ bill of rights."" The Liberals say that document encompasses “banning blind bidding, establishing a legal right to a home inspection, and banning new foreign ownership for two years to make the process of buying a home fairer, more open, and transparent.” According to N.W.T. Conservative candidate Lea Mollison’s campaign Facebook page, her party would increase housing infrastructure by utilizing what she terms a “northern housing allowance.” Posts to Facebook are one of few clues about Mollison's personal views on housing. The candidate, based in Thunder Bay, says her team has instructed her to decline all interviews before polling day. The Conservatives say they will address Indigenous housing by supporting a “for Indigenous, by Indigenous” strategy that involves working with “Indigenous communities and empowering Indigenous peoples with the autonomy to meet their own housing goals.” Conservative leader Erin O’Toole, in a letter written to N.W.T. Premier Caroline Cochrane this week, said the party would implement a dedicated Northern Housing Strategy that provides the territories with “their fair share of federal housing funding,” though that didn't include precise dollar values. O'Toole said housing funding would be predictable and stable, and the party would work with Indigenous groups and resource companies in the North to ensure housing gets built. In its federal platform, the party plans to build one million homes nationally in the next three years. NDP candidate Kelvin Kotchilea said at a news conference on Tuesday he and the NDP will work with Indigenous communities to implement a fully funded, Indigenous-led housing strategy within the party's first 100 days in office if elected. Kotchilea said getting locals involved in the process and training people from communities is an important part of the plan as a “one-size-fits-all approach” doesn’t work across the territory’s 33 communities. Consultation across the territory will be a major factor, Kotchilea said, noting some communities' houses primarily require repairs while others need new or better-suited units. “With housing, it ties back to mental health, because you do need to be in a more suitable environment that gives you that healthy lifestyle,” he said. “I think the struggle of affordability around housing, and just not having housing units in the community, is hurting a lot of people, a lot of families, and a lot of young people."" In its federal platform, the NDP commits to “create at least 500,000 units of quality, affordable housing in the next 10 years, with half of that done within the next five years.” In its federal platform, the Greens have committed to “develop inclusive and culturally appropriate Urban Indigenous Housing Strategies” that will be guided by First Nations, Inuit, and Métis groups. The national team says it would declare housing affordability and homelessness a national emergency, redefine affordable housing to ensure that term varies regionally, and appoint a federal housing advocate. The Greens will create a national moratorium on evictions, national standards for rent and vacancy controls, and “strengthen regulation to limit foreign investment and end predatory practices in residential real estate.” The party promises to build 50,000 supportive housing units over 10 years, and build and acquire a minimum of 300,000 units of ""deeply affordable non-market, co-op, and non-profit housing over a decade."" The Green Party candidate in the N.W.T. is Roland Laufer. Longtime N.W.T. politician Jane Groenewegen, running as an independent, said by email any response to the housing crisis must be broken down into the specific types of housing the N.W.T. needs. She gave the examples of housing for seniors, social housing for singles and families, housing for young working people, housing for vulnerable people, and market housing for a variety of tenants. Groenewegen said governments need to drive more participation in housing funding programs like the federal coinvestment fund. She said more use of such funds would increase the number of affordable new or refurbished units available. “I think government needs to look for ways to encourage participation and uptake in these monies already allocated, so the investments can see more housing available in communities of different sizes and levels of need,” she wrote. “This, along with continued funding commitments for social housing, needs to be made a priority at all levels of government.” Election day is Monday, September 20, with polls open across the Northwest Territories from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Subject: Affordable housing; Funding; Elections"

"2021-09-17","Full text: Shootin’ the Breeze chatted with each of the six federal candidates to discuss what they’re passionate about and what motivates them. They promised to make significant changes to economic and social policy, driven by a sense of frustration for the current government and empathy for universal pandemic problems. Mental health In the past year, John Barlow has seen farming families collapse under the burden of summer drought and struggle economically after illegal rail blockades stopped shipments of agricultural goods. He has watched as the pandemic caused huge financial losses and unemployment, leading to an increase in depression, anxiety and suicide, which in turn, added fuel to the national opioid crisis. “In the first half of the pandemic, we saw suicides and opioid deaths, overdose deaths triple in Alberta,” he said. He’s determined to do something about it. Since he was elected as a Conservative MP, Barlow has committed himself to breaking the stigma around mental illness. He voted in favour of a motion to establish the 988 national suicide hotline, to ensure that callers in crisis receive help quickly. He co-chairs the Conservative Opioid Crisis Working Group, which aims to get drug dealers off the street, help addicts recover and identify gaps in existing addiction support. If re-elected, he will oversee the creation of 1,000 new recovery beds and 50 local recovery centres, and will continue to consult with international and national health experts on mental health policy. Thriving mind, body and spirit Achieving ultimate well-being is as simple as exercising regularly, eating healthily and sleeping well, says Green party candidate Brett Rogers. He’s authored six books on physical, spiritual and psychological health. The wellness techniques he supports range from mainstream practices like workout routines, supplementation, meditation and yoga to alternative practices like electromagnetic stimulation, detoxification and psychic development exercises. He would like to see his lifestyle philosophies integrated into elementary school curriculum alongside classes on stress management and conflict resolution. Co-operative farming Michelle Traxel believes in supporting and rewarding intelligent business models. She herself is the owner of a small business, an Okotoks restaurant called Little Fast + Fresh. During the pandemic, she experienced a host of issues, including labour shortages and drought, which reduced the amount of food products available and disrupted the supply chain system. If it wasn’t for co-operative farming programs, she says, her restaurant would have been in deeper waters. The NDP candidate is involved with the Glaimax Collective, a project based out of Nobleford, consisting of 40 to 70 farms that share resources, labour and food. The collective allows her restaurant to order products from all of the farms involved, increasing the amount of food she has access to. If one farm has run out of a certain product, then other farms can supply it. Instead of having a seasonal product that is available only at certain times of the year, the collective ensures farmers can market their products in a more logical sequence, rotating their crops to ensure food is always being produced. Traxel plans to support this business model, so it can be developed on a wider scale, but she also wants to expand it by helping farmers make more deals with local grocery stores. Not only would this promote sustainability and lower carbon emissions, she says, but also allow farmers to bypass the big fees corporations charge for product packaging. Freedom of speech Daniel Hunter was a lifelong Conservative voter, but joined the People’s Party of Canada after the government started enacting stricter pandemic regulations. Mandatory vaccine passports, lockdowns and masking are a violation of Canadian rights and freedoms, he says, adding that people should have the choice of opting out. “We have witnessed the most sustained and unprecedented series of attacks against our rights and freedoms,” he said at a federal candidate forum on Sept. 1. “Politicians and bureaucrats have treated our guaranteed rights as if they were merely privileges that can be taken away or used as leverage for good behaviour.” His love for free speech extends beyond Covid, however. In a followup interview, Hunter said he is opposed to Bill C-10, a piece of legislation that seeks to protect media outlets from big corporations like Facebook and Twitter, that are eating into their share of profits. Hunter said the media should not be brought under the influence of the government in any way. He says the bill will allow the government to be a mouthpiece for news outlets, enabling it to control what journalists write in their articles. Disability support Liberal party candidate Paula Shimp knows what it’s like to suffer from a disability. She has mitochondrial myopathy, a disease that causes muscular and neurological problems, and she has spent a significant portion of her life unemployed due to ill health. Her condition causes chronic fatigue, presenting symptoms similar to what some Covid long-haulers face. Both illnesses, she says, decrease or inhibit mitochondrial function. If elected, she would develop a comprehensive plan to support Covid long-haulers with recovery, as well as other individuals with physical and mental disabilities. “When we come face to face with extraordinary challenges, we have the opportunity, collectively and individually, to draw upon and adapt existing strengths to move through and beyond our current troubles,” she wrote in a letter to Shootin’ the Breeze. Shimp had fallen ill and was not able to conduct a phone interview. Her plan includes installing more outreach services in rural areas, bolstering telehealth mental health services, promoting greater resource sharing between existing organizations, embedding social workers in local communities to provide referrals, and creating emergency response teams to help provide short term support like shopping, meal preparation, child-minding and transportation for ill individuals. Access to natural resources Josh Wylie has worked in the oil and gas industry since 2007, first as the vice-president for a publicly traded oil company and currently as a consultant for petroleum land management. While he appreciates environmental concerns about the industry, he thinks many of them are misguided, the result of political policy biased toward voters in urban areas like Toronto and Vancouver. The Maverick candidate promises to increase Alberta oil production and repeal regulations impacting the industry. He says he doesn’t believe jobs should be compromised in southern Alberta over environmental initiatives, when Canada is responsible for only a little over one per cent of total global emissions. Environmentalists should target the world’s largest emitters, he says. “All you’re doing is shifting that market share away from a highly regulated responsible jurisdiction like Alberta and that market share is going to go to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela or Brazil, places that aren’t as environmentally conscious,” he says. Meeting the candidates Pincher Creek will not be hosting a federal candidates forum this year due to the unusually short election time frame. Residents who wish to meet the candidates and ask questions can attend a candidate forum on Sept. 16 in Lethbridge at the Southern Alberta Ethnic Association, 421 Sixth Ave. S., from 5 to 7 p.m. For more information, please visit the Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce website.

"2021-09-17","Full text: With the federal election coming up, Cambridge Times and Metroland Media decided to look at the issues dominating the campaign. Here's a local look at climate change, and what the federal candidates are promising. CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change is an issue expected to be at the forefront of the election, and it is predicted to have specific impacts on the Waterloo Region. The Interdisciplinary Centre on Climate Change at the University of Waterloo predicts that the average annual temperature in Waterloo Region will increase by 2-3 degrees by 2050. If global greenhouse gas emissions in the region continue as they are, we are expected to face one full month of extreme heat every year, and winter temperatures in the middle of February may soon sit at zero degrees by 2050, if actions aren’t taken. The Region of Waterloo previously committed to reducing their corporate greenhouse gas emissions by 10 per cent below 2009 levels by 2019. Currently, there is no update as to whether this goal has been met. Most cities in Waterloo Region have a climate change adaptation plan that includes initiatives such as mitigating flooding, LED light upgrades, rainwater harvesting and developing new renewable energy sources. It should be noted that most of these were proposed solutions that haven’t necessarily been implemented. WHAT THE PARTIES ARE PROMISING Liberals: The party has vowed to bring natural greenhouse gas emissions 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels, with the goal of having net zero emissions by 2050."

"2021-09-17","Full text: With little time to prepare and no local NDP candidate already in place when Justin Trudeau’s Liberals called a snap federal election last month, several young people in Toronto got a chance to turn their desire for change into a tangible electoral effort. In Eglinton-Lawrence in the northwest of the city, 27-year-old Caleb Senneker hears frustration from voters who feel neither the Liberals (who have held the seat for all but four years in the last four decades) nor the Conservatives are vying for their votes or hearing their concerns. “The reception at the door has inspired me even more,” Senneker said of their daily campaigning in a riding that includes several low-income, high-density housing communities. “Listening to what people need and what they want from their elected officials both encourages me and saddens me.” Many residents have told him they are unable to reach their MP, immigration minister in the last federal cabinet Marco Mendicino, or receive an unsatisfactory response to their challenges, he said. A similar feeling of insufficient attention to an issue important to Senneker got them fired up to run in the first place, after receiving canned responses from federal, provincial, and municipal representatives when he sought more action on reconciliation following the discovery of the remains of hundreds of children buried at the sites of former residential schools earlier this year. “That made me angry, that these were people (who) could do something and weren't doing something,” he said. Senneker said he thinks younger people approach politics differently than older generations, less tied to a particular party and more likely to vote for solutions to the issues they face. “They know our future depends on change. We need to take action on climate change if we want a future,” they said. Senneker has shifted his allegiance over time, voting for Stephen Harper’s Conservatives in 2011 and Justin Trudeau’s Liberals in 2015, and firmly behind the NDP after the Liberals’ broke their promise on electoral reform. “I was so excited for the 2015 campaign promises from the Liberals and very passionately voted in favour of the Liberal Party and I had my dreams crushed,” they said. Christina Love wasn’t old enough to cast a ballot in the 2019 election that reduced the Trudeau government to a minority, so her first opportunity to vote will be in an election in which she is a candidate. “I have a vested interest in protecting my future, specifically the climate and the environment,” she said. “Those are just huge issues, so I wanted to make sure my vote wasn't going towards the status quo.” She was looking up the local candidates to decide who to vote for when she saw that neither the Greens nor the NDP were at that time fielding a challenger to the Liberal incumbent Shaun Chen. The NDP said it could help her get the 100 signatures needed, and initially wanted her to run in Durham as a sharp contrast to local MP and Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole. The 19-year-old is instead running for the NDP in Scarborough North, while also starting her third year of an Indigenous studies and French double major at York University as the campaign hit its final week. She wants to be an elementary school teacher outside the city, but for now, is extending her campus activism onto the national stage. Love said her focus is on labour rights and housing since those are the areas where she has the most experience, while environmentalism underpins everything since “the biggest issue any of us will ever face is the climate catastrophe.” Both Senneker and Love are concerned about housing affordability, with Senneker noting that their rent has doubled since 2014 despite moving from living alone to sharing with their partner. Love, who designed a series of housing and tenancy fact sheets while working a summer job with Social Planning Toronto, said there should be renewed and stable provincial and federal funding to expand co-operative housing as a sustainable housing solution that can also create community-building opportunities. “It's not reliant on a four-year government being re-elected and re-elected,” she said. “This is something that will build up our communities and stay built up.” Love, a cashier and postal clerk at a Shoppers Drug Mart who started organizing a union effort in late 2020, says she would also like to see a federal ban on back-to-work legislation and for the history and achievements of the labour movement to be more broadly publicized. “How unions win is that they strike and their demands are met, it's not that they strike, nothing happens, and then they're forced back to work,” she said. “It's really important that we're enfranchised and able to agitate for change, and that we know how to do so.” Subject: Electoral reform; Local elections; Climate change"

"2021-09-17","Full text: With the federal election coming up, Cambridge Times and Metroland Media decided to take a look at the issues dominating the campaign. Here's a local look at anti-racism and inclusion and what the federal candidates are promising. ANTI-RACISM AND INCLUSION In June of 2020, following the death of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter protests were held locally in Kitchener, Guelph, Cambridge and Brantford. Collectively thousands of people attended the marches, demanding an end to systemic racism. Similarly, when the remains of 215 children were found at a residential school in Kamloops, B.C., local memorials quickly popped up in the city of Cambridge, Kitchener, Guelph and New Hamburg. However, not many institutional changes have been made since those pivotal moments. WHAT THE PARTIES ARE PROMISING Liberals: The party has invested $400 million in their Black Entrepreneurship Program, and proposed Bill C-22 to address the overrepresentation of Black and Indigenous people in prisons. The party recently announced a $96-million investment initiative to back 1,300 projects from Black-led organizations."
"2021-09-17","Full text: ANTIGONISH – St. Francis Xavier University history professor Chris Frazer says he’s running under the Communist Party of Canada (CPC) banner to give the disenfranchised in Central Nova an alternative to the more mainstream parties. According to his Facebook page, “Chris is a LGBTQ2SIA activist, trade unionist and the Communist Party of Canada candidate for Central Nova…” He has also been an adjunct faculty member at the University of Rhode Island, a lecturer at Harvard University and an organizer for the United Auto Workers (UAW). He’s been affiliated with the CPC since 1980. At StFX, where he has taught since 2004, he has a disciplinary specialty in the history of Latin American bandits, “as well as pirates,” he says. Frazer is one of 26 party candidates in Canada, and one of only two in Nova Scotia; Katie Campbell is running in the Halifax riding. The Journal recently spoke with Frazer about his candidacy. What are your top priorities, and why do you think your party is the best choice at this time? “There are three things that we want to highlight. Address the crisis of climate change. Address the economic crisis – so things like joblessness, housing and employment income that are all associated with the third issue, which is the level of impoverishment that exists here in Central Nova. This is one of the most impoverished constituencies in the country. “I do see a connection between all of them. Climate change is helping to drive the economic crisis and vice versa. And those twin issues are keeping a significant proportion of this constituency below the poverty line. “I think that we’re putting forward a platform that will actually address the needs of the working-class people in this country. The other parties simply are not. They’re all campaigning from the right. They’re all tending to campaign with an eye towards austerity. So, it doesn’t matter what party you elect – NDP, Liberals, Conservatives, People’s Party, you’re going to see attacks on social programs. They want to give tax credits, rather than actually making affordable education. These programs are going to be under attack, regardless of which government comes into power, whether it's a minority, or a majority. It's just a question of whether or not it’s going to be better or worse. “So, if you want a representative who’s actually going to fight for the real needs and interests of people in this constituency, that’s absolutely the Communist Party.” What are you hearing from voters? “Well, it depends on the conversation you want to have with your constituents. Most of the candidates are having five-minute talks at the doors, and that’s about it. All they ever get is a superficial reading of what’s really concerning people because most people don’t believe that they’re [the candidates] the slightest bit interested in addressing issues like rent control, or raising the minimum wage to $21, or any of that stuff. “What people are really concerned about is what kind of planet we’re making for their kids. That’s the real issue. And I don’t hear any other party talking about that with any real substance. “The second thing is, even if we have a livable planet, are my kids going to have a decent standard of living? And the answer in a lot of cases is no – no real jobs and no significant income. The cost of property in this constituency, and the taxes associated with it, make home ownership for the vast majority out of control. “Why aren’t we building affordable public transportation in every community in this constituency? You’d put a hell of a lot of people to work. But nobody wants to talk about that because that means spending money on people to help them, rather than giving corporations the advantage by reducing spending and cutting taxes. “That’s what I hear from people, literally: Corporations and rich people getting by, while they [working people] are getting screwed.”"
"2021-09-17","Full text: Quebec’s Minister of Indigenous Affairs said in an interview he shares Kahnawake’s concerns with the Mercier Bridge and thinks it’s important for the provincial government and Kahnawake to come to an agreement on an overhaul of the span sooner, rather than later, for safety’s sake. “We have to do something about the Mercier Bridge. I’ve spoken to a lot of people in the community about it and a lot of them tell me they send their kids over that bridge every day into Montreal to go to school, so they are in agreement,” he said. Lafreniere had his first sit-down meeting with new Mohawk Council of Kahnawake Kahswennesawe Sky-Deer recently and the two tackled an ambitious agenda, addressing issues such as the nation-to-nation relationship framework, environmental issues, the land dispute at the end of Old Chateauguay Road and, of course, the Mercier Bridge. “It was a very good first meeting,” Lafreniere said. “We examined the list of priorities and we have begun working on things to make the lives of people in the community better right away,” he said. “What are the short-term priorities that will improve peoples’ lives right away?” High on the list was the Mercier Bridge, which has fallen into a state of disrepair and must be upgraded, Lafreniere said. The bridge’s reconstruction was taken off the list of proposed infrastructure projects for Quebec as part of Bill 66 at Kahnawake’s behest, Lafreniere noted. “There’s a bit of a sense of emergency to do something about the bridge, and we want to be able to work together to come to some sort of an agreement on how that should be done,” he said. As for the land dispute near the community’s border with Chateauguay, Lafreniere said the province had no plans to step in and help negotiate until after September’s federal election and November’s municipal election. Chateauguay mayor Pierre-Paul Routhier announced last month he wouldn’t seek re-election, and Lafreniere wants to wait until new leadership is in place before negotiations can begin. “I’ll be extremely careful on that. We have had open discussions with the city, but I think it’s important that we wait,” until new federal and municipal leadership can come to the table, he said. After a summer in which Lafreniere visited 32 First Nations communities across Quebec – it would have been more but for COVID-19 restrictions in Nunavik – with his daughters, Lafreniere said the testimony in the coroner’s inquest into the death of Joyce Echaquan last year in Joliette has hammered home the necessity of a First Nations ombudsman and facilitator in Quebec hospitals. “As you know, we didn’t wait for the report to become public to make moves to improve the system for First Nations Peoples,” he said. “The program we started in Joliette last year shows that our intentions are quite clear,” he said, mentioning the program could and will be expanded to health-care facilities across Quebec in the future. “We’d like that to be in every other hospital,” he said.

"2021-09-17","Full text: Claire Rattée, the Conservative candidate for Skeena–Bulkley Valley said she will not be signing an online pledge put forth by a Wet’suwet’en Gidimt’en clan asking candidates to commit to not provide federal funding for LNG Canada and Coastal GasLink projects in Northern B.C. Rattée cited Canada Elections Act (550) and said it prohibits candidates from signing pledges of any kind between nomination and polling day. Jennifer Wickham, media coordinator for Gidimt’en checkpoint, confirmed that the pledge – put forth on Sept. 13 by Wet’suwet’en First Nation’s Gidimt’en Clan asking candidates to prioritize the First Nation’s land rights and title, reconciliation and climate action over bailouts for large fossil fuel projects – had already garnered more than 14 signatories in one day. Elections Canada told Black Press Mediain that Section 550 of the Elections Act states a candidate must not limit or sign any document that represents a commitment to exercise or not to exercise his or her freedom of action in Parliament if he or she is elected or resigns from his or her position as a Member of Parliament if invited to do so by a person or an association. “Therefore, the candidate may not limit himself or herself in advance by making a commitment following the signing of a document. If this were the case, the candidate in question would be in contravention of the electoral law under Section 550,” stated Elections Canada, spokesperson Natasha Gauthier in an email statement. “The words “follow a course of action” here refer to making a commitment in advance, i.e., even before being elected, and thereby subjecting oneself in advance to restrictions on one’s “possible” role in Parliament,” added Gauthier. While Elections Canada did not comment on the specific case/pledge, it said any potential violations of the Canada Elections Act is undertaken by the independent Commissioner of Canada Elections, based on complaints. The signatories are mostly from the Green Party of Canada including Skeena Bulkley Valley candidate Adeana Young. Wickham’s list included Green candidates from B.C. such as Devyani Singh (Vancouver Quadra), Paul Manly (Nanaimo-Ladysmith), Lia Versaevel (Cowichan-Malahat-Langford), Jessica Wegg (North Island-Powell River), Tara Howse (South Okanagan-West Kootenay), Nicole Bellay (Mission- Matsqui-Fraser Canyon), Rana Nelson (Kootenay- Columbia), Farrukh Chishtie (Vancouver Kingsway), Alaric Paivarinta (Vancouver Centre). Green candidates from Ontario Gabe Rose (Kitchener South & Hespeler), Owen Bradley (Kitchener—Conestoga) and Angela Keller (Ottawa Centre) had also added their name to the pledge. “We have to prioritize Indigenous title and sovereignty and we have to act now in this climate crisis that we are in,” said Young in an email and added, “It’s time to reset and make changes to legislation and regulations that cause harm to Indigenous peoples and their unceded territories.” The Gidimt’en clan’s pledge request is the latest in a series of events going back several years in which the clan and its allies oppose the CGL pipeline, saying that hereditary chiefs had not given permission for it to cross their traditional territory. “If federal candidates are serious about reconciliation, they must commit to not subsidize projects that threaten our sovereignty, violate our land and sacrifice our future. Otherwise, when candidates talk of reconciliation, it’s just empty promises — and we’ve had more than enough of those already,” said Sleydo’ (Molly Wickham), a supporting chief in the Cassyex House of the Gidimt’en Clan, in a statement that came from the checkpoint office. The Gidimt’en clan did not immediately provide any information as to what LNG Canada and Coastal GasLink might have asked for in terms of subsidies. But it did refer to a $220 million federal grant provided to LNG Canada in 2019 to help buy efficient gas turbine engines that will super cool natural gas to a liquid state for shipping overseas. Those engines will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a selling point for the grant approval. In addition, the District of Kitimat also received a $55 million federal grant to replace the Haisla Bridge to provide better access from Kitimat to the industrial area in which LNG Canada is located. Tensions bubbled up in January 2020 when the RCMP arrested Wet’suwet’en members and others following first a provincial Supreme Court injunction banning the blocking of construction and then an enforcement order to remove anyone not obeying the injunction. Police presence in the area of the pipeline dispute has cost taxpayers at least $19 million, the Gidimt’en clan have also contended. The 670-kilometre-long pipeline in northern B.C. by TC Energy is to deliver natural gas from Dawson Creek area to the LNG Canada facility in Kitimat. The $6.6 billion pipeline, part of the $40 billion LNG Canada project, are estimated to provide more than 10,000 jobs over the construction period for both. The Gidimt’en clan is also accusing CGL’s contractor of digging in what it calls a biodiverse and archaeologically significant area over the past month without the permission of the Cas Yikh of the Gidimt’en clan. Responding to this, CGL said it operated under Site Alteration permit as construction will need to occur through the site to allow for the safe installation of the pipeline crossing at Lamprey Creek. In an email, CGL spokesperson Natasha Westover said these activities were monitored by a qualified archaeologist who has documented the site and preserved and inventoried artifacts. The Gidimt’en group further said the project, which allegedly violates Wet’suwet’en sovereignty, is already over budget and will fail without government assistance. In August, reports of financial talks between LNG Canada and CGL’s parent, TC Energy, surfaced after CGL said its original cost of $6.2 billion had increased to $6.6 billion. A LNG Canada spokesperson told Black Press Media that the new proposed cost was “over and above what was agreed to when we took our final investment decision in late 2018.” Responding to Gidimt’en pledge against subsidies, the spokesperson highlighted economic benefits. “Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission made clear that true reconciliation includes economic reconciliation: Access to jobs, training and education, and ensuring that Indigenous communities acquire sustainable, long-term benefits from economic development projects like ours,” the LNG Canada spokesperson added."

"2021-09-17","Full text: Housing, health care, the environment, roads, internet service and the economy were among the topics discussed at the South Shore-St. Margaret’s candidates’ debate held September 8 at the Best Western Hotel in Cookville. Sparring off over two-and-a-half hours were the Liberals’ Bernadette Jordan, who is looking for another term as the riding’s MP; Rick Perkins, PC candidate; Thomas Trappenberg for the Green Party; and the NDP’s Olivia Dorey. Emcee for the event was Blair Lipsett, vice-president of the Bridgewater and Area Chamber of Commerce, which hosted the event. It was sponsored by the Nova Scotia Association of Realtors. The candidates exchanged a few jabs, but for the most part they stuck to their scripts in answering the questions they had been given ahead of time. Questions later taken from the floor dealt with balancing the budget, care for veterans, conversion therapy, gender-based violence, immigration, as well as the economy and how each party plans to leave a legacy for future generations. Commenting on the housing crisis, Perkins said a PC government would build a million new housing units over the next three years by trying to get the private sector to move its capital more towards rental and housing through such means as tax incentives. Jordan said the Liberal government has been working with “all levels of government” on the issue and is investing $4 billion in a new housing accelerator fund to help build more homes faster. A re-elected government will also work with municipalities to identify empty spaces in their areas and invest in the conversion of empty spaces into market-based housing, she said. Further, there are plans to invest in building or renovating 1.4 million homes across the country by 2026. It would also ban blind bidding on properties. Dorey insisted “we need dramatic intervention now. “Neighbours don’t need more round tables, they need action right now,” she said. She added the government has had six years to address the problems, but there are still people living in tents, and housing costs continue to increase while wages do not. Dorey indicated the NDP would build half a million units of affordable housing and wants to waive the federal portion of the sales tax on the purchase of homes. Trappenberg saw shelter as a human right and said municipalities should be responsible to provide housing. He also said there were other options that could be explored, such as tiny homes. In answer to what many suggest is now a crisis in health care, Jordan echoed the Liberals’ plan to invest $6 billion more on top of the $4 billion already committed to support the elimination of health system wait lists. Moreover, she said, her government will also invest $3.2 billion to hire 7,500 more health care professionals. The Liberals also are strategizing to make Canada more attractive by offering student loan forgiveness to professionals who practise in rural Canada, noted Jordan, as well as by investing more in telehealth and making it easier for inter-provincial migrants as well as immigrants with the proper medical qualifications to practise in Canada. Jordan indicated they would also hire 50,000 more support workers with a high minimum wage to get them in the workforce. Dorey suggested the pandemic has exposed huge gaps in the health care system, which, she said, was in crisis mode even before COVID-19 hit in earnest. She suggested there’s no longer such a thing as universal health care with so many things that aren’t covered for people. However she agreed that immigrant accreditation is an area that needs tackling to help with the lack of doctors. “We don’t want doctors (from another country) driving taxis.” On the subject of temporary foreign workers, Perkins noted there is a shortage of workers on the South Shore and postulated that the issue was “exacerbated by the introduction of the CERB or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. “We need to start getting people back to work,” he said. Jordan was adamant in her response. “I can’t believe someone would say that. We put money in place to allow people to have food on the table and a roof over their heads during a global pandemic,” she countered. Jordan suggested the economy is recovering, “but people are making different choices. We need to make sure workers are available and I think the best way forward is immigration.” Trappenberg provided perhaps the most candid closing message among the candidates. He admitted it was “highly unlikely” he would win in the election, though he still encouraged people to vote for Green. “Why vote Green if I have little chance to win? It is not a lotto. But voting Green is saying to all parties that we want more visionary actions and [to] move into the 21st century,” said Trappenberg.

"2021-09-17","Full text: Booting up rural high-speed internet is high on the wish list for Saskatchewan's small towns. ""There's a need for it across the country, but particularly in Saskatchewan, because we've got such vast areas with not a lot of people living in them,"" said Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities president Ray Orb. SARM is doubling down on its stance that rural internet is an essential service — which has only grown more important as rural communities' education, health care and business shift online during COVID-19. The three main federal parties are all pledging to kick-start the rollout of service in communities where coverage remains spotty. The Liberal and Conservative platforms promise to apply a 'use it or lose it' approach to carriers who've bought spectrum rights, telling them they need to develop rural service or risk losing those rights. Orb said that's a good direction. If big players aren't developing rural service, he wants them to make way for smaller internet providers to fill the gap. The NDP's platform promises to declare high-speed internet an essential service, with plans to make it available for all within four years. The platform says that's an early step to creating a Crown corporation “to ensure the delivery of quality, affordable telecom services to every community.” The Conservatives are also pledging for high-speed internet to be available for everyone by 2025. Meanwhile, the Liberals say their plan will push carriers to reach ""access milestones between now and 2025."" The party's 2019 platform said the service should be available for all by 2030. Those benchmarks can't come soon enough for Orb. He wants funding to ramp up in the next five years. ""I think they need to really rethink that (year) — 2025 is still basically four years away and I think we need to look at what's happening right now. There needs to be more funding now."" SARM isn't the only organization raising the alarm over poor internet and cell service. The Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan has also called on federal parties to fix rural connectivity woes that affect farmers' business. SARM also wants farmers to get sequestration considerations under the carbon tax, a better safety net for farmers emerging from a punishing drought, and more money for rural infrastructure. Many rural roads and bridges are in dire need of repair and replacement, but ""we haven't been getting a lot of federal funding coming into Saskatchewan,"" Orb said. ""We don't think we're getting our share."" He said these issues highlight the important of consultation, especially because an early election prevented some priorities — like getting a carbon tax exemption on grain drying — from making it into law. ""There's some good policies and there are some that aren't so good for rural Canada,"" he said. ""And I think, for whoever gets elected, consultation is important.""

"2021-09-17","Full text: New MPs must take sexual-harassment training OTTAWA - Newly elected MPs will be required to take a training course to prevent sexual harassment in their offices. The awareness course will educate new MPs on what counts as harassment — and how to take steps to prevent it. The course, paid for by the House of Commons, will address many forms of harassment, as well as violence prevention and the abuse of power by MPs. New MPs must complete the training by the end of the year, along with new Commons staff. Sitting MPs already have to take anti-harassment training every three years. The harassment prevention session, called Strengthening a Culture of Respect — from Awareness to Action, will be offered in English and French. It will be run by ADR Education, a Victoria-based training company which offers courses on ""building and sustaining a respectful workplace."" The courses develop skills to ""address harassment or disrespectful behaviours."" The conduct of MPs has come under the spotlight once again during the election, with allegations that a Liberal MP harassed a female member of his staff. Last week, the House of Commons’ most senior official ordered a fresh look at whether there are ""shortcomings"" in the policy on sexual harassment, and whether improvements need to be made. The move followed questions about a Commons inquiry into Raj Saini, former Liberal MP for Kitchener Centre. The clerk of the House of Commons wrote to Michelle Rempel Garner, a Conservative, to tell her he had asked the head of human resources to examine the Commons' handling of the matter. Saini stood down as a candidate after facing a barrage of questions about claims he harassed a female staff member, allegations he says are ""unequivocally false."" Liberal whip Mark Holland last week warned against a ""trial"" of Saini, who has said he will not discuss the allegations because of privacy concerns. The Tories and NDP have questioned why Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau allowed Saini to run for re-election. Rempel Garner, who rigorously campaigned as an MP against sexual harassment and urged politicians from all parties to speak out, criticized the Liberals' handling of allegations against Saini, as well as previous complaints. The Conservative candidate for Calgary Nose Hill suggested MPs might benefit from even more training on the issue, perhaps twice a year. But training MPs would not improve behaviour if ""the culture in the party is of coverup,"" she said. Speaking to The Canadian Press, she said there is an ""inherent power imbalance on Parliament Hill"" which ""rewards silence"" over inappropriate behaviour. ""Members are required to (sign up) for mandatory training. I am just not sure if it is strong enough or frequent enough,"" Rempel Garner said. New MPs will be able to choose between virtual or in-person harassment prevention training and must complete the course within three months of taking their seat in the House. The harassment course is one of a series of orientation courses offered to newly elected MPs by the House of Commons, including on the hiring of staff. Heather Bradley, director of communications in the office of the Speaker of the House, said the training would focus on ""setting up a healthy workplace."" ""The goal of this training session is to give participants a better understanding of the roles that the member and their employees play in maintaining a culture of respect in the workplace, and it focuses on harassment and violence prevention in the workplace. "" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 15, 2021. Subject: Sexual harassment; Prevention"
"2021-09-17","Full text: With the federal election coming up, Cambridge Times and Metroland Media decided to take a local look at the issues dominating the campaigns. Here’s a local look at housing, and what the federal candidates and parties are promising. HOUSING Over the last five years, Waterloo Region has been a part of a surging housing crisis, with the average detached home selling for $919,914, according to the Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors. A report from the City of Kitchener found that over half of households in Kitchener could not afford to buy a home, and a report from the City of Waterloo found that a household would have to make $150,000 a year in order to own a home. According to regional data, 2017 was a pivotal year in the Waterloo Region housing market. It marked the year that the median price of a resale home surged 22 per cent. As prices continued to rise in the Greater Toronto Area, homebuyers in those areas widened their search to cities such as Hamilton, Barrie, Guelph and, eventually, all of Waterloo Region. This year brought approval for a number of affordable housing projects, including a 28-unit apartment for seniors at 33 Front St. in St. Jacobs.; a 25-unit building for people with mental illness at 290 Sheldon Ave., Kitchener; an 28-unit building with 66 market-rate apartments at 726 Hampshire St., Waterloo; and a church being converted into 43 units at 825 King. St. W. in Kitchener. Habitat for Humanity will also be building 20 affordable stacked townhomes in Cambridge at 325 Shantz Hill Rd. WHAT THE PARTIES ARE PROMISING Liberals: Have promised to preserve, repair or build 1.4 million new homes over the next four years. They’ll also help renters become homeowners through $1 billion in loans and grants, and set up a tax-free First Home Savings Account to help young people save for their down payment faster."

"2021-09-17","Full text: The federal election is ramping up with advanced polls held locally between Friday, September 10 and Sunday, September 12, and election day on Monday, September 20. Residents of Drumheller will be voting for a candidate for the Battle River-Crowfoot riding, which is currently held by the Conservative party, and residents of rural Kneehill and Wheatland County will be voting for a candidate for the Bow River riding. The Battle River-Crowfoot riding is a fairly new riding, having been created in 2012 from the former electoral districts of Crowfoot and Vegreville-Wainwright. It stretches from the Town of Three Hills east to the Saskatchewan border to north of Tofield, following the Battle River, and south to the western edge of Drumheller and the borders of Special Areas No. 2 and the County of Newell. There are seven candidates vying for the Battle River-Crowfoot riding in the upcoming election--Daniel Brisbin for the Green Party, Jeff Golka for the newly formed Maverick Party, John Irwin for the Veterans Coalition, Leah Diane McLeod for the Liberal Party, Tonya Ratushniak for the NDP, Dennis Trepanier for the People’s Party, and Damien Kurek for the Conservative Party. The riding was formerly held by Kevin Sorenson between 2015 and 2019, with Damien Kurek taking over in 2019 with more than 85 per cent of the vote. Bow River has had a long history as a constituency, having first been created in 1914, and has since been abolished in 1966 and 1987, and recreated in 1976 and 2012. When it was recreated in 2012 it was recreated from portions of the Crowfoot, Medicine Hat, and Macleod ridings. The riding stretches from the boundaries of the Battle River-Crowfoot riding, encompassing both Kneehill County and Wheatland County, and southward to Taber.

"2021-09-17","Full text: Liberal leader Justin Trudeau’s hint at federal intervention to kill Quebec’s Bill 21 should he return as Prime Minister, is being panned by anti-racism advocates as doublespeak. “He has said this before in 2019 and has not done anything since…he is just throwing out hope to get votes,” said Errol Patrick Mendes, a professor of constitutional and international law at the University of Ottawa. “Many…many people across the country are furious at there being no attempt by the federal government to challenge the law,” he said, adding the debate question on Bill 21 has raised awareness of its discriminatory nature across Canada, especially in ridings where immigration and systemic racism are key issues. Mendes, who heads the Canadian chapter of the International Commission of Jurists, told NCM that his organization plans to seek intervenor status should the on-going legal challenges against Bill 21 at the provincial level hit the Supreme Court. “We intend to argue what the federal government should be arguing,” he said. Mendes said that the next prime minister should unequivocally denounce Quebec’s Bill 21 and mount a federal challenge to the discriminatory law which will impact all racialized religious minorities in the country, anti-racism advocates say. However, none of the federal political party leaders will fully commit to this in the final stretch of the current election campaign fearing the loss of votes in Quebec, he said. “All of the party leaders are in the same boat…they all want to say as little as possible on this issue during the campaign…it’s sad,” said Mendes. While the concerns about Bill 21 – which bans civil servants from wearing religious symbols at work, and the accompanying Bill 96, which would make French the only language needed to work in the province – have been mainly a Quebec provincial issue, it was thrust into the national spotlight during last week’s English Language leader’s debate. During the debate, moderator Shachi Kurl asked Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-François Blanchet to help Canadians outside Quebec understand why his party supports the discriminatory laws. The fiery exchange that ensued and post-debate fallout has been hogging election news coverage nationally, reverberating in the immigration-fuelled 41 federal parliamentary ridings, where visible minorities and New Canadians form the majority. During the debate, none of the political leaders on stage addressed the protestations by Blanchet. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau later said the question regarding Quebec’s secularism law was “offensive” while Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole said the question was “unfair” but would not intervene to kill the Bill. The NDP’s Jagmeet Singh said his party won’t challenge the law, because it is essentially a provincial issue. Trudeau backtracked on his post-debate indignation at Kurl’s question Sunday saying he hasn’t “ruled out” federal intervention to challenge Bill 21 in court. “We have not taken off the table intervening at a later date because no federal government should take off the table the ability to stand up for people’s fundamental rights,” Trudeau told reporters at an election campaign stop on Montreal’s South Shore. Balpreet Singh Boparai, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization of Canada (WSO), said Trudeau’s hint about federal intervention gives Sikhs some hope despite him promising something similar in 2019. “Mr. Trudeau’s comments do reiterate a point he has made in the past and we are hopeful that the federal government will recognize the threat Bill 21 poses to fundamental human rights not just in Quebec but potentially across Canada and intervene in the challenge against this discriminatory law,” he said. Jagdeesh Mann, a Vancouver-based ethnic media specialist, said the existence of Bill 21 should matter more to all Canadians, not just the people of Quebec. According to the latest Canadian Press-Leger poll, the Liberals and Conservatives both have the support of 32 per cent of decided voters. The NDP are in third with 20 per cent. In Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois has seen a three point bump to about 30 per cent of the provincial vote, said Andrew Enns, vice-president with Leger research. “That bump has a lot to do with the wide coverage and emotional reaction to the question in the English debate about Bill 21,” he told NCM.

"2021-09-17","Full text: With less than a week until submissions for the municipal election close, there are just four official nominations for local school board trustees – one for the Medicine Hat Catholic Board of Education and three for Medicine Hat Public School Division. Ken Loehndorf is the only nominee running for the Catholic board. Catherine Wilson, Jillian Schempp and Pat Grisonich are all vying for the chance to be a trustee on the public school board, while Dave Pollard has also confirmed to the News that he will run. Loehndorf relocated from North Battleford four years ago. The former educator spent a decade as executive director of the Saskatchewan Catholic School Board Association and 15 years as director of education for the North Battleford Catholic School Division. “I feel like I have some pretty good background for this position,” said Loehndorf. “After working in Catholic education for 25 years, I would really like to provide some support and help to Catholic education in Medicine Hat.” Loehndorf says he’s ready to serve. “I believe strongly in and am passionate about Catholic education,” said Loehndorf. “I want to make sure our schools are able to maintain their distinctive Catholic nature. I’m confident they’re doing that now and I would like to support that.” Pollard is a minister at Fifth Avenue Memorial United Church who has two children in the public school system. “I very much believe that when boards work well, it can be of great benefit to staff and students,” said Pollard. “I’m hoping to continue in the excellent work of SD76.” Pollard says it’s important to support school-aged kids. “People say they’re the future; I think they’re the now,” said Pollard. “I think if we have a school board that’s concerned about them, their well-being and their education, we can set ourselves up for a wonderful future if we act now.” Catherine Wilson, who has been serving as the chair of the local public board since last October, came into her role by winning a by-election when her father passed away after spending 32 years as a trustee. “I finished the last seven months of his term,” said Wilson. “I was involved in school councils all through my kids schooling; I was an involved parent and had an interest in being a trustee. When my dad passed away, I had this amazing drive to finish his term.” Wilson has served two full four-year terms as a trustee, and says kids are the key to making our future better. “It has been a challenging year, but I think that we’re all in it for our kids, staff and families,” said Wilson. “We’ve worked hard to make sure they’re safe and I’d definitely like to have four more years to be a part of it.” Pat Grisonich has been a teacher and administrator in both the Catholic and public divisions for more than 35 years. He says community support for students is important. “The reason that I’m running for trustee is because I still enjoy being around education and school systems. I loved my job and everything about it,” said Grisonich. “Now I feel like if I can try something totally different by becoming a trustee and help out in the school district, help students, staff and teachers, then I want to be a part of that. If I have something that I can offer with my experience, then I want to help.” Subject: Public schools; Catholic schools; Students; Community support; Education; School boards"
"2021-09-17","Full text: Trudeau, O'Toole tied as campaign hits final bend OTTAWA - The two front-runners in the federal campaign laid out their cases for why their opponent was misleading voters, hoping to win electors' trust as a new poll suggests the Liberals and Conservatives are running neck and neck. The poll conducted by Leger in collaboration with The Canadian Press indicated the parties are tied with the support of 32 per cent of decided voters. A similar poll conducted two weeks ago had the Conservatives ahead with 34 per cent compared with 30 per cent for the Liberals The polls cannot be given a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples. With such a tight race, the parties are trying to woo swing voters who have yet to cast a ballot — 5.8 million votes were cast over four days of advance polls, Elections Canada says — and drive a get-out-the-vote campaign complicated by COVID-19. During a stop in Richmond, B.C., Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau looked to push progressive voters away from Jagmeet Singh's New Democrats by arguing only his party could prevent the election of a Conservative government. Trudeau argued that Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole's plan would be detrimental for the country and the issues progressive voters care about, invoking the name of former prime minister Stephen Harper to link O'Toole to his predecessor's track record on climate change. Trudeau also said the Conservatives were being dishonest with voters when Tories say the Liberals would tax the sale of primary residences if re-elected to govern. ""These are the things that we're seeing from Erin O'Toole. He's not leading. He's misleading,"" Trudeau said. O'Toole toned down his attacks from a day earlier when he painted the Liberal leader as privileged and entitled — saying while Trudeau was ""partying,"" he was doing search-and-rescue missions in the military — but nonetheless told reporters in Russell, Ont., that electors shouldn't reward Trudeau for another term. He argued a vote for anyone but a Conservative is a vote for the status quo. O'Toole also dismissed Trudeau's rhetoric on the previous Conservative government, saying the prime minister wanted to revive battles of the past with a platform and party that ""no longer exists anywhere other than his imagination."" Then he similarly accused his main rival of being dishonest and untrustworthy. ""Canadians deserve an honest government, an ethical government, and one with a plan,"" O'Toole said. ""Mr. Trudeau has let people down time after time after time. We deserve better than that."" If the trajectory of polls bear out on election day, the country could find itself again with a minority government with the NDP or Bloc Québécois potentially holding the balance of power. The Leger poll suggested New Democrats support was at 20 per cent of decided voters, down from the 24 per cent of respondents from a poll two weeks earlier. Campaigning in downtown Toronto, Singh sidestepped a question about whether there was anything he would specifically need to see from either a Conservative or Liberal government to earn his party's support. Instead, he focused on his party's promises to help with affordability concerns and a desire to make sure the ultrarich and profitable corporations pay more in taxes to help defray the fiscal cost of federal pandemic aid. ""That's what Canadians can expect from us. They can expect from us someone who is going to stand up for them and fight for them,"" Singh said after outlining plans to lower wireless prices. ""We're not looking to plunge the country into elections, we are looking to get results and that's what Canadians should know."" In Quebec, the Liberals are holding steady with support of 34 per cent of decided voters polled by Leger, compared with 30 per cent for the Bloc Québécois. Bloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet said Tuesday that he believes there has been a swing his way in the province after last week's national debates. Green Party Leader Annamie Paul finished a two-day swing in Prince Edward Island, hoping to build on the provincial party's recent electoral success. The Leger poll found support for the Greens among three per cent of decided voters. ""Every Green who has ever been elected provincially or federally has gotten re-elected in this country because they work incredibly hard for their communities,"" Paul said.

"2021-09-17","Full text: With five days left for Canadians to head to the polls on Sept. 20, Skeena-Bulkley Valley candidate Lakhwinder Jhaj is visiting the riding for the first time today. Jhaj told The Terrace Standard she will be in Prince Rupert and Terrace until Sept. 16. Abbotsford resident Jhaj was nominated by the Liberal Party of Canada to represent one of the largest federal ridings on Aug. 20. However, she did not have any campaign activities in the riding and declined an invitation to attend the all candidates debate hosted in Terrace on Sept. 7, due to personal reasons. Speaking about her late arrival to the riding, Jhaj said, “I am honoured that I’m going to be coming there and get to meet people.” While she admits to not having any deep background about the history of the riding and its communities, Jhaj said non resident candidates have been selected before. When asked about her late entry on the campaign scene when most of her competitors are on the last stretch, Jhaj said, “Well, I decided to come forward and and let people know that I am the person that is on the ballot.” Election polling analysis website 338 Canada projects Jhaj will get 11 per cent of the vote in the riding while New Democrat incumbent Taylor Bachrach will receive just over 50 per cent of the vote. Jhaj said she is aware her visit might not make the make a huge difference right now. “I don’t live in the community, I’m not from the community but I will be counted in on the ballot for the federal Liberal Party and I will try to reach out to as many people as I can in those few days that I’m there, but other than that, I’m very honoured to be on the ballot for team Justin Trudeau,” added Jhaj.

"2021-09-17","Full text: As the federal election looms, leaders of all political stripes are promising to increase the zero-emission transportation sector through incentives and investments as a key tool to tackle the climate crisis. But there’s a catch. Positioning Canada as a leader in electrifying the transportation sector also means increasing mineral extraction to fuel that growth. Batteries that propel electric vehicles are powered by minerals like lithium, cobalt, graphite and nickel. The transition is necessary, given the implications of the alternative: continuing to burn fossil fuels as our means of getting around. The transportation sector in Canada currently accounts for around 25 per cent of national greenhouse gas emissions, around 180 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, according to Natural Resources Canada. As the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned, “unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5 C or even 2 C will be beyond reach.”"

"2021-09-16","Full text: Young people being overlooked by parties: experts With eight days to go before the 2021 Federal Election, the three major parties are promising all sorts of incentives to secure the votes of Canadians. However, when it comes to the futures of millennials and generation Z, some financial experts say the Liberals, Conservatives and NDP could be doing more for these demographics. Millennials represent the largest generation of Canadians and make up 27 per cent of the population, said Christopher Dewdney, a certified financial planner and principal at Dewdney&Co in Toronto. Despite their size, he said, millennials remain overlooked when it comes to the current election. “The focus of all the major party platforms is toward their parents, not them,” he said. While parties will need to consider the budget and ever-increasing debt levels, Dewdney added, younger Canadians should still be a priority. “This generation is dealing with higher student debt as well as substantially higher cost of living than the [generations] before. All parties should acknowledge this and move towards doing more,” he said. One area in particular that could be improved upon is student debt reduction, deferral or forgiveness, he said. The NDP is the only party to make student debt forgiveness part of its platform. While the party has promised to forgive up to $20,000, Dewdney suggested moving that number up to $30,000 would be more effective. “I believe that, by [the NDP's] own admission, the average amount of debt is closer to that $30,000 number. It doesn’t seem like much but it is material, especially for someone struggling to build up savings towards a down payment.” Jason Pereira, partner at Toronto-based Woodgate Financial and president of the Financial Planning Association of Canada, said housing is a key issue for young Canadians right now, but no politician wants to do what’s necessary, which is drop housing prices. “There is a fundamental difference between the concept of affordability and accessibility. Affordability means its easier to afford a home and that means, on average, that people are making more money or things cost less. Accessibility is about putting programs in place to try to make it easier to get a home without changing anything else,” he said. “One of the problems with Canadian housing is the fact that no one has been willing to do anything that is going to negatively impact prices. But, you can’t fix the housing crisis without a negative impact on the pricing. So, we’ve seen instead a bunch of initiatives announced by all of them that would actually make the housing crisis worse,” he said. For instance, he explained that the Liberals want to create an investment savings account, called a First Home Savings Account, that would allow people under 40 to save $40,000 toward the purchase of a new home, with deposits and withdrawals tax-free. “The problem is we already have the ability to save $115,000 roughly with the RRSP and TFSA. An individual saving $40,000 in a city like Toronto is not the problem. All they’re basically doing is making it easier to save more, to then, in turn, take on more debt and put yourself into greater financial difficulty,” Pereira said. Further, while all three major platforms aim to increase housing supply with low-income housing availability, it’s actually up to the provinces to roll it out. “The issue is that they will have to deal with the red tape at the provincial and municipal level and this will impede the ability to roll it out quickly,” Pereira said. “There is nothing that any of them of are promising that will actually do anything but make the situation worse. They’re all throwing money at the problem. And, when you throw money at the problem, you basically have more buyers, which only pushes prices higher because demand has shifted without a corresponding increase in supply to offset it.” Proposals for the rental market aren’t looking promising either, according to Pereira. For instance, the NDP is offering $5,000 in annual rent subsidies but that money is likely to flow directly to landlords, and could lead to a push for higher rent. “The problem is how many votes is someone going to get by standing up and saying we need to lower everybody’s housing price by 20 per cent?” he said. “No politician would do that. There’s no votes to be garnered there.” When it comes to child care, another popular topic for younger Canadians, Pereira said the Liberals and the NDP are doing the right thing for this demographic by offering child care for $10 per day. Pereira also noted that climate change will be a hot-button issue for young Canadians in this upcoming election. “We live in a global marketplace and different countries will be affected at different degrees. Everything from the frequency of humanitarian crises to the stability of trade will be impacted,” he said. Whereas the Liberals and NDP have taken a stance on climate change, the Conservatives, despite including climate change policies in their platform, failed to pass a vote at their national convention to acknowledge that climate change even exists, Pereira added. Shannon Lee Simmons, financial planner and founder of the New School of Finance, said many of her younger clients are asking about climate change and the future of the economy with the rise of artificial intelligence. “It’s hard to make long term financial plans in the face of such uncertainty. While most parties are addressing climate change in some way, the future of the job market far beyond the next four years is something that many gen Z clients are asking about,” she said. “I suspect that any party that has creative solutions to replace income in order to accommodate major potential shifts in future job markets would be of interest to Gen Z.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 14, 2021.

"2021-09-16","Full text: A glitch in the Elections Canada system has left almost 70 percent of registered voters in Brampton East without voter information cards as the deadline for advanced polling looms tonight. Voter information cards, delivered to all voters by mail, are not required to vote, but they provide residents with information about how and where to take part in Canada’s 44th election. The Elections Canada issue means delivery of the cards has been held up, forcing some residents to search for voting information themselves. Many will likely have to wait till September 20, if they cannot access voting information and for those who rely on the information cards for advanced voting, the glitch might remove the early option for them. Elections Canada is encouraging Brampton East voters to either go to its website or call (1 800-463-6868) so they can get all the information they need to either cast a ballot before advanced polls close this eveing, or even if they plan to vote on the 20th (cards should be delivered by then). The technical error could complicate one of Peel’s most intriguing political races. Brampton East sees a relatively inexperienced incumbent facing stiff competition from two well-known opponents. Liberal Maninder Sidhu has served just two years on Parliament Hill, compared to six years for his incumbent colleagues. Conservative candidate Naval Bajaj is making another bid for the seat he contested and lost in 2015. The seat, once represented provincially by Jagmeet Singh, was also a key target for the NDP in 2019, after former Liberal MP Raj Grewal left federal politics following a scandal around an addiction to gambling he developed after arriving in Ottawa. The NDP nominated well-known candidate Gail Bannister-Clarke, a union and education leader in Peel, to contest the riding. Manjeet Singh is representing the People’s Party of Canada, while the Greens have not nominated a candidate in the riding. Residents now have only a week until polling day. Their votes will decide which party represents some 122,000 residents. But with advanced polling open over the weekend, many were left waiting for voting instructions in the mail before heading out to cast an early ballot. Elections Canada expects voter information cards to be in Brampton East mailboxes before polling day itself, on the 20th, and is issuing instructions in the interim. Even if the cards fail to materialize before polling day, anyone who has registered to vote in Brampton East is still eligible to mark their ballot. “As of September 12, 2021, it is estimated that over 52K electors in the Ontario electoral district of Brampton East did not receive their voter information cards (VICs) in time for advance polls, which began on Friday, September 10, 2021, due to a technical error,” Dugald Maudsley, a regional media advisor with Elections Canada, told The Pointer. “Affected electors will receive a voter information card in time for election day.” Registered voters do not need an information card to vote in Canadian federal elections. The number of people missing their voter information cards is almost equivalent to the total number of votes cast in Brampton East during the last federal election. In 2019, 51,263 ballots were cast for all candidates, with 24,050 for Sidhu, 13,368 for the NDP’s Saranjit Singh and 12,125 for Conservative Ramona Singh. Pandemic upheaval means voter information cards were set to play a particularly important role this year. Elections Canada has made a concerted effort to re-evaluate traditional polling locations for COVID-19 safety. Smaller pop-up voting spots, including those organized within apartment complexes, are being dropped in favour of bigger buildings where social distancing and other safety measures are easier. The reorganization means voters who could have visited the same local polling spot for years may not see the usual black and yellow voting signs hung outside, as the location has changed. Community centres and local arenas are being temporarily converted and equipped with more reception desks than polling locations in the past to safely process as many voters as possible. These pandemic-related changes are the reason the voter information cards were sent out later than usual, as election officials worked last minute to finalize all the polling stations that could be used to accommodate social distancing and other safety requirements. Information about changing locations should already have dropped into homes throughout Brampton East. In the absence of physical information cards, voters are being told to go online. Elections Canada is advising anyone in the riding who had registered to vote to make use of its website. The page includes details of local polling places, candidates and opening hours. Residents should visit the Elections Canada website and type their postcode into a purple box on the home page. After clicking ‘Go’, they will be taken to a page that includes information on how to vote, where and when polling stations are open. The Elections Canada website can be accessed by clicking here. The technical glitch could be especially impactful for seniors in the riding, many of whom are less comfortable with digital material. Older voters tend to turn out in larger numbers than their younger counterparts who are more comfortable with web-based wizard tools. Around 10 percent of Brampton East’s population was 65 years or older when the fieldwork for the 2016 Census was completed. The demographics of the 52,000 electors who are currently without a voter information card are not known. Data from Elections Canada also show a relatively low appetite for mail-in voting in Brampton East. Only 1,071 postal voting kits had been issued in the riding as of September 9, 17 percent of all mail-in voting kits ordered across Brampton’s five ridings. “Advance polls are open until 9 p.m. today, Monday, September 13. Electors can vote at their local Elections Canada office before September 14, 6 p.m., or they can vote at their assigned polling place on election day, September 20,” Maudsley said.

"2021-09-16","Full text: In the past two federal elections, Vancouver Island has been a stronghold for the NDP, and one campaign observer predicts it will largely stay that way after Sept. 20. But there are some chinks in the orange armour on the island given the strength of voter concern about the climate crisis and Erin O’Toole bumping up the popularity of the Conservatives, the NDP’s historical nemesis in the region. There’s no doubt the recent Green Party infighting offers the NDP some advantage this election with climate-concerned voters, said Mark Williams, chair of political studies at Vancouver Island University. But the edge the NDP might enjoy could be undercut by the anger environmentally conscious voters feel for the B.C. NDP government around the protection of old-growth forests and the contentious Fairy Creek blockades, he said. Regardless, the NDP shouldn’t underestimate the Green vote, which has been on the rise in southern Vancouver Island ridings over the last couple of elections, Williams said. “In the south, I think that there's a large contingent of people (who) are really kind of viewing everything through the climate crisis,” he said. This strength of environmental concerns has created a number of four-way races in the region, particularly in Victoria and the riding of Esquimalt-Saanich-Sooke. But if there is any potential for an NDP upset, it would be in Victoria where the race is particularly tight, Williams said. “It is very possible, although I don’t think it’s going to happen,” he said “But it probably would have if the Green Party leadership was in better shape.” However, many pundits predict the NDP will actually increase its hold on the island by retaking the Nanaimo-Ladysmith riding won by the Greens in 2019. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is certainly hoping so. He has visited the riding twice in the past couple of months in a bid to unseat incumbent Paul Manly, who won the last election by a comfortable margin over his nearest Conservative competitor while the NDP came third. But Williams disagrees, citing the deep roots and individual support Manly enjoys in the riding. “I imagine Paul Manly will win in Nanaimo-Ladysmith,” he said, noting the incumbent enjoyed a 10 per cent lead over the second-place candidate. “I don't really see either the Conservatives or the NDP really having the forces in play that will allow them to unseat him. “The Green Party leadership is in disarray, but I think that Manly's support is still quite strong.” While the NDP needs to be wary of the Greens in the heavily populated south — where voters are no longer as committed to the resource economy — the Tories are the main competition in the central and northern regions of the island, Williams said. “Especially in the (north) there is that sense that we need to support extractive industry,” he said. “So, that's where Conservatives are fairly strong and a serious challenge to the NDP.” But Conservative support in individual ridings depends heavily on the personality and profile of the candidates, he said. The rise of the NDP at the expense of the Tories — which used to sweep Vancouver Island — is likely due to an increasing sense of inequality and the party’s commitment to socially progressive ideals that benefit workers, Williams said. “There is this growing disillusionment with approaches that seem too laissez-faire, or too free market, and there’s a sense that economic activity really needs to benefit society more broadly,” he said. “This pushback against the Conservative party is (voters) aren’t entirely convinced their policies are going to really deliver on jobs and improvements in quality of life. “Where it seems the NDP and their focus on workers’ rights seems to connect with a lot of people on Vancouver Island.” While each riding has specific issues of importance this election, many of the key concerns across Vancouver Island reflect those on the national stage, Williams said. Health care, housing, affordability, climate change, and Indigenous issues are top of mind on the island, he said. The lack of family doctors or access to medical care, housing prices coupled with a rental crisis, and the rising costs of living are issues across the island — in urban and rural communities, he added. “Affordability is one of those things that just seems to be resonating throughout the country,” he said. “Even a relatively small city like Nanaimo has seen real estate prices increase by $300,000 for homes within the last ... six years.” And with a large number of First Nations communities on the island, people have a heightened awareness around the importance of Indigenous rights and reconciliation, he added. In the end, it’s probably the breadth of the issues of concern in the election that gives the NDP an advantage over the Greens on Vancouver Island, Williams said. “The NDP is dedicated to environmental policy, but it's done so ... within this context of economic security, which I think still resonates with a lot of voters on the island.” Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer None Subject: Conservatism; Native rights; Climate change; Elections"
"2021-09-16","Full text: Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole got a very specific Mississauga experience as he stood behind the Port Credit Royal Canadian Legion on the edge of the Credit River. Boats drifted along the meandering water in the background, which was framed by lush greenery. A stone’s throw away one of the city’s only independent breweries thrives, while regular commuter trains thundered past on the Lakeshore West GO line during O’Toole’s speech. The portrait of Mississauga was a snapshot of how the city hopes to transform itself. Bold plans include world-class parks, accessible transit and a bustling restaurant scene. A far cry from the sleepy notion of the former bedroom community. But the reality for many still leaves much to be desired. North of Port Credit, residents are stuck on local buses for hours and many are cut off from Lake Ontario and a patio pint along the water by yesterday’s urban planning, as transit has not yet caught up with the city’s future ambitions. To enable its transformation, the City of Mississauga has made a series of demands of federal leaders. At the beginning of the campaign, Mayor Bonnie Crombie sent a letter to all party leaders demanding taxpayers receive their fair share of funds back from Ottawa. At the top of the mayor’s request was a list of upgrades to Mississauga’s transit network. The city is currently without a meaningful rapid transit system as it waits for the Hurontario LRT to launch in 2024. Its only current high order transit asset is the Mississauga Transitway, an expensive and underutilized bus corridor. O’Toole is the only federal leader to respond to Mississauga’s request, according to the City’s website. The Conservative leader sent his reply to Crombie early in the campaign but his words, while welcome as a sign of recognition, were light on detail. References to GO Transit expansion and the Eglinton West LRT extension (largely built through Toronto) were his only acknowledgements of specific transit needs. Mississauga’s list of demands is much longer. The City wants support for two-way, all-day GO (something the Liberals have loosely promised) and funding to add roughly two more kilometres to the Hurontario LRT’s route, looping it around downtown, as was the original commitment when the previous Ontario Liberal government announced funding for the full route, before the Doug Ford PCs cut the downtown loop out of the plan, citing rising project costs. The City has also requested a new downtown transit terminal, along with a bus rapid transit route along Dundas Street. Funding for all four requests would catapult Mississauga’s transit network into the future. It would mean subway-style service on the Milton GO line through the heart of the city, buses could bypass traffic on one of the city’s busiest streets and an LRT would serve its rapidly growing downtown population, while providing linked bus routes throughout the city a central rail spine right down to the Port Credit GO Station. A central transit hub would also be developed. Pre-pandemic ridership data show Dundas Street as the second busiest transit route in Mississauga. The City of Mississauga asked Ottawa to help manage the $305.7-million cost of building a bus rapid transit route along the street in 2019. When Parliament was dissolved and the election called, the incumbent Liberals had not made a decision on the project. The Pointer asked if O’Toole would commit to Mississauga’s request for Dundas Street funding. “We want to see success and for the commute times and for the Dundas transit project, we will try and be there as a partner,” he said. “Part of our housing commitment is also to make sure that we push for density and more housing as part of our transit investment. We have got a very comprehensive plan to get a million homes built in three years, partnering with all levels of government as opposed to ignoring these issues and making them worse as Mr. Trudeau has.” As O’Toole suggested, the success of Mississauga’s rapid transit network could go hand-in-glove with its housing policy under a Conservative government. The Party’s platform says it will “require municipalities receiving federal funding for public transit to increase density near the funded transit.” It is unclear exactly how the Conservatives would define “near the funded transit” for housing density. The Province uses a system of Major Transit Station Areas to govern its transit-oriented housing projects, only applying the term beside higher-order transit stations such as light rail, bus rapid transit or commuter rail. This would mean to increase density in Mississauga through funding incentives, the Conservatives would have to support requests for bus rapid transit or LRTs and not just dollars to improve its bus fleet generally. The bus system largely extends out to the city’s sprawling subdivisions where density is only found in patches, where the odd high-rise or townhouse development is surrounded by single-family homes. O’Toole was in Port Credit on his first campaign visit to Mississauga. He was shadowed at the podium by Mississauga—Lakeshore candidate Michael Ras. The riding, a Conservative target in the 2019 election, is also being contested by Sven Spengemann for the Liberal Party, Sarah Walji for the NDP and Elizabeth Robertson for the Greens. Vahid Seyfaie is representing the People’s Party of Canada. The Conservatives have failed to secure any seats in Brampton or Mississauga in either of the past two elections — the Liberals swept both cities in 2015, and again in 2019, with eleven red seats. This year, even two or three of those, could be the difference between a Liberal or Conservative minority government, which is what current polling suggests will be the outcome after September 20. O’Toole is hoping for a return to the 2011 election result, when his party won every seat in Peel. Across the 905 generally, previous Conservative leaders have struggled to breakthrough. That’s something O’Toole says he wants to change by rebranding his party, including vocal support for action on climate change. “I’ve said many times, we need to rebuild trust with some Canadians, including some suburban folks in Ontario,” O’Toole said in Mississauga. “We’ve worked very hard to do that with respect to the environment — that’s why we put out a plan in April; with respect to economic recovery — we have a plan to get Canada back on its feet… we’ve got a new leader, we’ve got a plan, we’ve got incredible candidates.” One issue he did not address is the controversial GTA West Highway. It has become a lightning rod across parts of the GTA and the next federal government will decide its fate, following the conclusion of an ongoing review by the impact assessment agency. The Conservatives have not issued a formal position on the future of the highway. With advanced polls open and the election barely a week away, O’Toole and his party won’t have to wait long to see if their rebranding exercise works in the vote-rich 905.

"2021-09-16","Full text: Walking the sleepy streets of Vista Heights, you could forget there is an election taking place. Meticulously manicured gardens frame suburban forever homes, chairs sit on front verandas where a good book helps the afternoon slip away. Open garages reveal the types of lifestyles lived in this quintessential suburban setting—bright coloured bikes and equipment for all sorts of family activities fill the walls. Election lawn signs that litter more urban settings are mostly absent along the rows of carefully kept yards. This quiet enclave seems untouched by the constant noise of a federal election whose main combatants now appear before us by the minute, flooding all available platforms to woo our X into the right circle on September 20. On paper, this tranquil neighbourhood is in one of the most hotly contested federal ridings in Peel Region. Former Liberal MP Gagan Sikand is not seeking reelection after disappearing in 2020 on an undisclosed medical leave and Leader Justin Trudeau has already visited the riding to prop up his new candidate, Rechie Valdez. The Conservative Party has nominated Dr. Jasveen Rattan and the NDP is being represented by Farina Hassan, its Milton candidate in 2019. Gurdeep Wolosz is running for the People’s Party of Canada, Chris Hill for the Greens and Natalie Spizzirri is the Animal Protection Party of Canada’s candidate. Neighbourhoods like Vista Heights are key for all those vying to become a parliamentarian. Behind the ‘wine mom’ doormats and carefully hung wreaths, multiple voters live inside, often part of a demographic in such places whose residents turn out to vote in disproportionately high numbers. The party strategists and spin doctors in Ottawa pay special attention to earn their trust. Hundreds of tactically placed advertisements appeal to the emotional and practical needs of voters—can an opponent be trusted, who will look after your retirement savings, is your child’s future safe, what will happen to the planet? Carefully coordinated social media campaigns tend to use a decidedly negative tone, trying to frame other parties and their would-be prime minister as dishonest and dangerous, with little to suggest any actual vision for the country. At this stage, phone calls and email blasts are mostly relied on to push voters to the polls. In many races, the age-old tradition of door knocking can determine the final outcome. Parties have relied on face-to-face communication for decades. There’s no filtering of messages, no slick advertisements to hide behind and the one-way blast of information and disinformation is replaced by tough questions voters get to pose from the comfort of their own home, as their visitor sweats on the doorstep, grilled about the lack of childcare spaces in the neighbourhood, why immigration portals can’t handle the demand, a lack of support for small businesses and taxes that don’t come back into the communities they’re supposed to support. Candidates get a chance to directly pitch themselves, showcase their personality and communication skills. Residents outline their most pressing needs so whoever wins can shape priorities in Ottawa to represent those that sent them there. And if these needs are ignored in favour of mouthing the party line, many residents have a long memory for the next time a candidate comes knocking. The Pointer went to Vista Heights Sunday afternoon to see how the election ground-war is playing out during the final stretch of the campaign. Residents who opened their doors to reporters said they had seen few party representatives and many admitted they had no idea who their local candidates are. “Yesterday a bunch of teenagers, Conservatives, [came past],” Mike Pena said, standing in front of his garage as he finished a chocolate-covered ice cream. “But no Liberals yet.” Early in the week Peel-based news outlet Parvasi Media, asked Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole during a press conference about the absence of candidates in their own ridings. “I have been running around in many of the ridings in the last couple of weeks to find your candidates’ campaign offices, to find their telephone numbers,” the reporter said, expressing concern that other sources around the GTA have also said it has been difficult to track down information on some candidates who have not been visible during the campaign. “We have incredible candidates that I can guarantee you have likely knocked on more doors than all of the other parties, in some ridings more than all of the other parties combined,” O’Toole replied. Several residents in Vista Heights said they had received Conservative pamphlets without speaking to the candidate, while no one had spoken to the NDP or Liberal candidates. For some, the lack of political gumshoeing has been a welcome relief, others expressed frustration over the lack of direct communication to help make their decision. “At least it gives a personal touch, at least I know who is representing me and [that] they care enough to knock on the door and to talk to me,” resident Pankaj Kushwaha said, admitting it was unlikely to sway his vote. “I didn’t watch the leaders' debate, I just followed it a little on the news, so I know exactly what they are trying to say.” Kushwaha has rarely been visited by candidates, even during much longer election campaigns. “I don’t think I have spoken to any candidate, other than for mayor,” he said. “Someone would come around or I’ll meet them at the train station… but for [the] federal election, I haven’t really seen anyone coming around.” One resident, Bill Corrigan, said he had been forced to search for information on local candidates himself and was disappointed in what he found. Candidate websites didn’t rank especially well in his search results and when they were eventually tracked down, he found their biographies to be tacky exercises in PR. He pointed to Rattan, who used the prefix for doctor, and whose website says she has a Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo without indicating what she studied. “I had to Google myself and it was hard to find the information, it didn’t come up,” Corrigan said. “Facebook posts came up first and if you don’t have access to Facebook, you can’t see it. You want their website right away.” Vista Heights is home to a range of Mississaugans. Around 43 percent of its residents are immigrants, while 35 percent belong to a visible minority group, according to the 2016 Census. The area’s 2015 median household income was $84,531 and the vast majority of residents (81 percent) commute to work by car. For Jenny and Jason Davis, the car was responsible for plenty of election confusion. The couple, who recently moved to the neighbourhood, have seen rising gas prices and both are considering switching to electric vehicles to save on the rising cost of fuel. “We were just talking about buying a new car because the gas prices are so high and [with] two vehicles that need gas, we are looking at going electric,” Jenny Davis said. “We’ve been reading up just this past weekend about the rebates that are being offered, but it’s not all electric cars that are being offered the rebates."" Her husband, Jason, has found this election one of the toughest in his life to navigate. “Honestly, I find my stance hasn’t changed,” he shrugged. “The parties’ stance has moved so far, I’m still standing in the same spot and I’m looking over going, ‘Am I Conservative now?’ I honestly don’t like any of the leaders.” The importance of local candidates varies from one voter to another. Some concentrate on the national platforms and the leaders, analyzing the party policies, while others are interested in how a local candidate will advocate for their area. John Carreiro, who is concerned about wasted tax dollars, said he voted for whichever party offered the best deal for him and his family. That means jumping from one to another at election time, analyzing which platform is best for him. “I’ve never been a one-party person,” Pena said. “When [Stephen] Harper was around, I didn’t like the way he was selling the Canadian resources to foreign nations… so I voted for the Liberals, thinking there would be change, but none of their promises ever came to fruition. And that’s what really upset me, because, you know, that in turn affects the four, five years that they’re in power. You see it now.” This time around, he’s most concerned about the impact of the pandemic and COVID-19 vaccine rules. He believes Canada is in danger of losing its status as a safe refuge for people fleeing communism and other oppressive regimes. For Doreen Middleton, a senior in her 70s who used to work with visually impaired and deaf students, care is top of mind. “I am concerned about child care because I have grandchildren and I used to work with special needs children, and I wasn’t really agreeing with what the Conservatives are saying,” she said. “The Liberals had already started this child care thing and the other thing that upset me with the Ontario government was what happened in the long-term care homes because it could have been me… And the environment, I am very concerned about the environment.” To glean what their prospective constituents expect representation on, candidates must do the hard work. Every home they call on has a resident experiencing something that concerns them, and the job description means their MP has to give voice to these top-of-mind issues on Parliament Hill. This year’s shortened election campaign has left very little time for candidates to make their pitch or learn about their electors. The riding of Mississauga—Streetsville has some 118,000 residents and just over 85,000 registered voters. With so little time to campaign in 2021, it seems not every voter is being afforded the same chance to share their views with candidates as they seek the responsibility of becoming a member of parliament. “In the past… when the time came to vote, you knew who you were voting for,” Jenny Davis said. “You just knew who the candidate was. I think times have changed.” — With files from Natasha O’Neill Email: isaac.callan@thepointer.com"
"2021-09-16","Full text: The riding of Mississauga—Lakeshore holds an important place in Peel’s climate conversation. The area covers the entirety of Mississauga’s border with Lake Ontario, an area that was once dominated by grimy industry. Recent efforts to reclaim the shoreline with parks and sparkling new developments have coincided with vital conversations about pollution as a result of urbanism. At the same time, increasingly disastrous storms and flooding have added urgency to the conversation about how we care for our planet, and look after vulnerable areas such as Mississauga’s waterfront area. Because of the surrounding geography, with Mississauga essentially at the bottom of a basin leading into Lake Ontario and with watersheds flowing down from the north across much of the city, large areas are susceptible to flooding. In the run-up to polling day on September 20, a group, GreenPAC, is organizing a series called 100 Debates across the country to discuss climate change. The program, which was also held in advance of the 2019 election, is designed to bring attention to the climate crisis. The debates use grassroots democracy as a form of advocacy. “Debates are often seen as defining moments in elections,” the 100 Debates website explains. “Candidates will be challenged to put their best ideas forward and voters will be empowered to hold future MPs accountable for those ideas. MPs consistently and vividly recall the issues raised at all-candidates’ debates, which can translate into policy gains once a government is formed. Coordinated, large-scale, issue-based, debates like this can generate enough attention to directly impact voter and party priorities.” One such event was held Wednesday in Mississauga—Lakeshore. Liberal incumbent Sven Spengemann, Conservative candidate Michael Ras and the Green Party’s Elizabeth Robertson all took part in the virtual conversation. Organizers said the NDP’s Sarah Walji declined their invitation. Compared to national debates among party leaders, which often spiral into made-for-television gotcha opportunities, the Mississauga—Lakeshore climate debate was composed. It offered a refreshing glimpse into local political representation free from the strategizing and cynicism behind so much of the national party vote counting. Three election hopefuls waited on mute until they were called upon to answer questions and regularly found common ground. Partisan attacks or dire warnings were saved for the national perspective and not directed at opposing candidates. “This is another area that I find myself in a great deal of agreement with Mr. Spengemann,” Ras said when asked what policies the candidates would put in place to protect vulnerable populations from climate change. It was one of the multiple times the candidates found themselves on the same page. The format of the debate itself did not encourage opposition. Candidates were asked four questions of national importance followed by four about local issues. Speakers were then selected in random order to answer the questions in turn. While there was space to challenge opposition platforms, there was no period of open conversation or rebuttal, making the event more of a round table or a panel than the blood-sport approach of national debates. The four national questions yielded very little from any of the three candidates. The questions essentially evaluated how well each had memorized their respective party platforms rather than testing the calibre of the individual candidates as local environmental activists with a deep familiarity of the issues directly impacting Mississauga residents. The four broad questions were sometimes more a request, asking candidates to commit to pledges such as protecting 30 percent of Canada’s land and freshwater, modernizing the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and forcing all sectors to decrease emissions to 60 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The organizers also pushed for the federal government to withdraw fossil fuel subsidies and asked for commitments to carbon pricing. “Being a Green is very easy, I’m just going to say,” Robertson said, agreeing to the Paris Agreement’s targets and promising to push them further. Fielding national questions, the candidates either trotted out the relevant portion of their party’s platform or skirted questions while dancing around the topic. “The Liberal Party has committed to protecting at least 30 percent of our land, freshwater and oceans by 2030,” Spengemann said. “Our plan includes 10 new national parks, 10 national marine conservation areas and 15 new national urban parks. We are committed to 30 percent by 2030 and we have a proven track record to get there.” Ras pushed back. “Mr. Spengemann talks about a track record of success but we’re moving awfully slowly in that target,” he said. “We’re going to invest an additional $3 billion between now and 2030 in natural climate solutions focused on management of forests, crop and grazing lands, restoration of grasslands, wetlands and forests.” On the local questions, it was the challenger, Ras, that offered the most specific ideas. Unburdened by electoral records, candidates often make promises incumbent politicians do not, with those seeking reelection relying more heavily on what they and their party have already done. Candidates were asked how they would take a sector-by-sector approach to climate change at the local level. The moderator asked for a commitment to low carbon transportation, deep retrofits of existing buildings and increasing the usage of renewable energy sources. Robertson reiterated Green pledges on transit and retrofits. Spengemann referenced the importance of electric trains on the Lakeshore GO line to increase service and reduce emissions (a policy largely under provincial control but usually partially funded through the federal level), also promoting a variety of Liberal promises for transit and retrofits. Ras repeated Conservative talking points, before pivoting into a rare local example. “I have this great vision,” he said. “Sheridan Park, which is in our riding, some of the leading science that solved the acid rain crisis in the 1980s was done in that park, the CANDU nuclear reactors were designed by engineers in that park. And you go through there now and it feels like a wasteland… wouldn’t it be great if we attracted the investment back to that park to build the next generation of carbon capture technologies or zero-carbon nuclear reactor technologies?” The good-natured discussion ended with broad commitments to environmental principles from candidates. Ras said he would draw on locals with experience, including his current opponents, to work on the climate crisis if elected, while Spengemann cast his eyes around the world promising to work on international and interparliamentary climate caucuses. Robertson admitted she only had an outside chance of landing a seat, saying her role was to push the other candidates beyond their party’s past record and represent those who can not wait a day longer for change.

"2021-09-16","Full text: Maria Rose Lewans is running as an independent in the 2021 federal election for the Cypress Hills – Grasslands riding. Lewans also ran in the last election and has had her name stand in many different political races in recent years at all three levels of government. Lewans says she is running again because she is fed up with how the country is being operated. “When I feel like I have no options to vote for, I just can't sit there and complain, I have to do something,” said Lewans. Lewans explained that she hates politics and won’t tailor her message for anyone. She will leave it up to the people to see if she gets elected. If Lewans does get elected she would like to change the monetary system, focus on the environment and watershed, create local perennial food systems and ban the importing of technology to Canada to reduce waste and pollution. “When COVID shut down everything the world didn’t end, maybe we can stop producing stuff, stop these factories and just say ‘what do we need,’ the world's not going to end if we stop production,"" she stated. ""We need to prepare for winter, we need to prepare for impending droughts.” “We should do more perennial food systems because we can't be spreading all this fertilizer like our soil is on life support, we can't be spreading all these chemicals and fertilizers everywhere and using the fuel system,"" she added. Lewans also believes that Canada should have some type of mandatory military service, where everyone is taught disciplines like Tai Chi. “The world is crazy, it is what it is, we know there's lunatics out there,"" she said. ""And instead of a society of basically weak, useless people, we train ourselves, we have skills, so that if we need them - hopefully we will never need them - we know how to use them.” Lewans says the journey of an independent candidate is much more difficult than the challenges faced by candidates of established parties. For one, an independent candidate does not have a brand or money to back them in their campaign. “I don't have a party or money behind me,"" Lewans said. ""And I like working - the world doesn't stop turning because there's an election.” Lewans created her own signs which have been posted at various locations. She said she created the signs to make people aware that there are other options in this election, particularly for those who have stopped paying attention to elections and don't like any of the other party choices. “I thought if I put up some signs at least people might think, ‘oh, there's somebody else running, maybe I'll at least look into what this person has to say and pay attention’,"" she explained. ""I mean, that's all I can do, because I can't stop my life to just campaign.” Lewans hand-painted all her signs and put them out herself and does have a few more ideas she hopes to unveil before the campaign is over. Lewans is a Swift Current local and grew up on a farm near Shaunavon. She currently works in construction. Lewans is the last candidate in the Cypress Hills-Grasslands to profiled by The Standard. Four candidates were profiled last week but The Standard was unable to reach Liberal candidate Mackenzie Hird and Green Party candidate Carol Vandale. There are seven candidates running in the Cypress Hills-Grasslands riding. They include Mackenzie Hird, Liberal Party; Charles Hislop, People’s Party; Maria Rose Lewans, Independent; Alex McPhee, New Democratic Party; Jeremy Patzer (incumbent), Conservative Party; Mark Skagen, Maverick Party; Carol Vandale, Green Party.

"2021-09-16","Full text: --- (COVID-Ont) The province says businesses and patrons could be fined if they don't follow new vaccination requirements taking effect next Wednesday. Patrons will initially be required to show a paper or digital receipt of vaccination along with a form of government-issued I-D to enter settings that include restaurants, theatres and gyms. Businesses will have to ensure the name and date of birth on the vaccination receipt matches the I-D before allowing customers to enter -- but they will not have to validate doctors' notes for medical exemptions. Health Minister Christine Elliott acknowledges that could open the possibility for fraud, but says she expects such cases will be rare. Elliot also says vaccine bookings increased by nearly 30 per cent after the government announced the policy. (The Canadian Press) --- (Ont-Long-COVID) Ontario's science advisory group estimates tens of thousands of people in the province are suffering from what's known as long COVID. It says a conservative estimate suggests between 57-thousand and 78-thousand Ontarians had or are currently still experiencing symptoms, weeks to months after contracting the virus. The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table says the most common of more than 200 different symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, general pain or discomfort, anxiety and depression. It's calling for more research to help the health-care system better prepare to deal with the impact of long COVID in the future. (The Canadian Press) --- (Ont-MP-Assault) A 56-year-old woman has been charged with assaulting Liberal M-P Marc Serre (sehr-AY') at his campaign office in Sudbury. Police say the woman pinned Serre against the wall by pushing a table against him, then hit his hand with her cellphone when he began recording the confrontation on his phone. They say the woman, who claimed she had been injured by one of Serre's campaign signs, left the office. But she allegedly confronted him again when he left the building -- yelling and striking the hood of his vehicle. Police say the woman is to appear in court in November on a charge of assault with a weapon. (The Canadian Press) --- (Ont-Election-Sign-Thefts) Provincial police are investigating the thefts of several federal election campaign signs in Dunnville.

Ontario Court Justice Richard Humphrey found the wife of celebrity businessman Kevin O'Leary not guilty of careless operation of a vessel in the crash that claimed two lives. Humphrey found the other vessel had its lights off when it was struck, despite testimony from passengers who said some of the lights were on. He said it ""defies logic"" to suggest passengers on the Nautique would have activated the lights when they went out on the lake to avoid light pollution while stargazing.

"2021-09-16","Full text: Jermaine Chambers decided he wanted to become a “servant of the people” years ago. So far, it has been a case of always the candidate, never the politician. The financial advisor ran provincially as the Progressive Conservative candidate for Brampton West several years ago, losing to the eventual winner and member of provincial parliament, Amarjot Sandhu. He then unsuccessfully contested a place on Brampton City Council, failing to unseat Doug Whillans in Wards 2 and 6. Now, he has won a federal nomination to represent the Conservative Party of Canada in Brampton West. The snap pandemic election has provided Chambers with an early chance to represent his community, an area he says he is desperate to give back to. “I like to say there is one taxpayer,” he told The Pointer at his campaign launch, explaining why he has run for all three levels of government, each of which is equipped with different powers. “We don’t have a taxpayer at the municipal level, a different taxpayer at the provincial level and one at the federal level; at the end of the day, it’s one taxpayer.” Chambers believes his experience campaigning for different seats of power can help the residents of Brampton West if he is elected. As a former provincial and municipal hopeful, the Conservative candidate has an understanding of how different powers are distributed and has promised to make working together with various levels of government a key priority if he wins election September 20. “We have auto insurance, for example, in Brampton which is one of the biggest issues,” he said. “There is room there for a member of parliament like myself when elected to collaborate and with my provincial partner to say [that] we need to work on these affordability issues for the people of Brampton. They can pass legislation [governing insurance], however, we have access to the competition bureau, for example, we can ask them to investigate [if] there [is] some collusion between the insurance companies that is driving up the cost of insurance here in Brampton West — what is that and how will we fix it? I believe it comes down to leadership.” He echoed this sentiment during a speech at his campaign launch. “I will sit down with my friends from the Province — the MPPs from the Province, the ministers from the Province — and we will work out a fair deal for Brampton on auto insurance,” he said. Sandhu, who faces reelection next June, appeared at Chambers’ campaign launch at the end of August to endorse the candidate and promise to work together with him. He had previously endorsed Chambers’ run to become a councillor. Before deciding to run for office, Chambers spent more than a decade working in the financial sector. He currently offers mortgages, advising families on the financing involved with purchasing a new home. His undergraduate degree is in business management, while the candidate also has a license to operate as a mortgage agent. “That financial background, I think, is going to work wonders for the people of Brampton West,” he said. The riding is being contested by Kamal Khera for the Liberal Party and Gurprit Gill for the NDP. Rahul Samuel is the People’s Party of Canada candidate. Collaboration is a theme that runs through Chambers’ commitments. The candidate, who has been critical of Khera for losing her role as parliamentary secretary after travelling during the pandemic in violation of her government’s own guidance, argues that partnership is the key to delivering for voters. From transit funding to healthcare, bilateral work is at the heart of the Jermaine Chambers pitch. “I think that Brampton has missed a number of opportunities,” he said. “We have been talking about LRT for a few years, we've been trying to get it fully funded for a few years, we have been talking about other projects like bus rapid transit for a few years, we have been talking about our hospital for a few years.” Earlier this year, the provincial government announced a plan to expand Peel Memorial into a full-service hospital. The announcement, which was criticized for being misleading by opposition parties, promises Brampton a new 24/7 emergency wing at Peel Memorial that will bring 250 desperately needed in-patient beds, far below the 850 Brampton needs and what the City had officially called for. The provincial government had pledged more than 15 years ago to deliver two full-service hospitals to the city, and by the time Memorial is finally expanded to admit patients (it currently has no overnight beds and only a part-time urgent care ward) Brampton will need four full-service hospitals, not just two. Basic healthcare access for Brampton residents has been a failure of leadership, Chambers said. “We recently had an announcement [about Peel Memorial] from the Province, and the federal government was absent,” he said. “That’s what we need in Brampton, we need a federal partner, someone who is really going to advocate for the people of Brampton and you can count on me to be there for Brampton’s priorities.” Chambers promises that his commitment to Brampton will go above even the party. Asked if he would vote against a Conservative line when legislation pushes against the unique interests of his riding — the city’s two PC members, Sandhu and Prabmeet Sarkaria, failed to push back against their party when it torpedoed an NDP motion for a second Brampton hospital, in a clear show of loyalty to their party ahead of the constituents who put them in office to represent their needs — Chambers said he did not think his Party would propose such legislation. If it happened he said he would consider opposing it. “Erin O’Toole is on record as saying he is giving members of parliament free votes, except as it becomes [about] supplying confidence to the government,” Chambers said. “As a member of the team, you can’t vote to bring the government down and I would never do that. But my first priority is to the people of Brampton who elect me, if there is something that is coming forward, I think is going to negatively impact the people of Brampton West, my job is to speak up.” O’Toole has previously said he encourages free votes on “matters of conscience” including assisted dying and abortion. The Pointer could not find reference to free votes on issues such as infrastructure funding or immigration, which are likely to directly impact Brampton West. Looking at Brampton West specifically, Chambers says the general issue of affordability, particularly when it comes to housing, is top of mind for him. “It’s affordability, it’s housing,” he said. “I am a mortgage agent and I finance so many mortgages for people, young people, who have moved out of Brampton because they can’t afford it.” Email: isaac.callan@thepointer.com"
"2021-09-16","Full text: In the unlikely event Phil De Luna is elected in next week’s federal election, he says his first legislative action would be to push for all MPs to receive scientific literacy training. The 29-year-old Green Party candidate for Toronto-St. Paul’s says a dearth of understanding about how science works among politicians is holding Canada back when it could be used to create policy solutions. “If we are able to have that training, we'd be able to tackle a broad range of problems — not just the climate but in social inequality, in health care, in national security, in innovation policy in general — in a more cohesive and coherent way,” De Luna said in a phone interview with Canada’s National Observer. The young candidate, who took a leave of absence from a National Research Council role in April in order to run, says much of the technology needed to sharply curtail our contributions to global warming are within our grasp but hindered by politics. “The gap is in political will, it's in policy, and it's in action,” said the researcher, who stepped away from leading a $57-million program to develop new clean technologies to join the fray. “I know exactly what it takes to take technology out of the lab and into the marketplace. I know what we need to do to get to net-zero.” De Luna is up against Liberal incumbent Carolyn Bennett, a cabinet minister in the last government who has held the seat since 1997. De Luna and his campaign team also know how to work with what they’ve got; building a bespoke web-based canvassing app to identify the neighbourhoods with the most potential Green voters in the riding that runs just north of Dupont Street up to Eglinton Avenue. He says that the app and other no-code tools have helped him run a campaign with just over $40,000. In fact, the team decided to stop accepting campaign donations more than a week ago, encouraging supporters to instead give to relief efforts in Afghanistan. He has also shared much of what he has learned on the campaign trail in a series of videos (including on how to become a candidate, how to canvass, and how to look after your mental health in the process). De Luna, who has completed a PhD in materials science and engineering at the University of Toronto, said he knows how privileged he is to be able to take six months off work to campaign and hopes to lower barriers to politics for candidates who would otherwise find it difficult to get involved, including youth. “There are so many other young people who need to have their voices heard in Parliament who aren't in that same position that I am,” said De Luna, a first-generation Filipino-Canadian. “And so I feel it is incumbent upon me to run and to elevate the conversation, to advocate for more science in politics. It just felt like this was the moment.” De Luna says he considered running for other parties but chose the Greens not only because he supported leader Annamie Paul, who recruited him personally, and the party’s platform but also because he is impatient to make a difference and the Greens offered the most direct path to do so. “I'm a startup person, I'm an underdog. I like small teams and being agile,” he said. De Luna said he would like to see Canada make more use of private-public partnerships to help shift green technology innovations from the lab to the marketplace, and for federal scientific funding to be made available for longer than the typical three- to four-year timeline that limits the ability to plan for the long term. “We need to stop doing these Band-Aid measures and these announcements that are, quite frankly in my view, done politically to buy votes,” he said. He said the primary difference between the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis is the timeframe on which they play out, with a lag of weeks between infections and deaths from the virus and a gap of several years between carbon emissions and the rising temperatures and more extreme weather they create. “The problem I think primarily with humanity is the short-sightedness due to the competing priorities in our daily lives,” he said. “But if we can come together as governments, as societies to address this crisis, then the cost is minimal to have to adapt to this before it's too late.” Subject: Clean technology; Politics; Elections; COVID-19"

"2021-09-16","Full text: Party leaders denounce hospital protests OTTAWA - The federal New Democrats and Liberals made mirror pledges on Monday to criminalize protesters that block hospitals or harass health-care workers as party leaders denounced planned demonstrations at hospitals countrywide. A group calling itself Canadian Frontline Nurses has planned ""silent vigils"" in response to public health restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19, which they say are ""tyrannical measures and government overreach."" Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside Toronto General Hospital, many to condemn Ontario's proof-of-vaccination system that is scheduled to take effect next week. Police were also there as part of what local officials said would be an effort to maintain access for doctors, nurses and patients, if necessary. Speaking in Sioux Lookout, Ont., NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said a federal government can't ban protests, nor can it limit where people can demonstrate. But Singh pointed to the Criminal Code as a means to dissuade such demonstrations from happening. His party's platform pledges to make it a federal offence to harass or obstruct someone from accessing medical care, and provide harsher penalties for anyone assaulting a health-care worker. He said protesting at hospitals was different than demonstrating elsewhere, such as rail lines, noting that blockading a hospital could mean someone dies. ""It is not the space, it is not the place to protest,"" Singh said in front of his campaign plane in the northern Ontario town. ""If you're in any way threatening health-care workers, impeding their ability to go to work, you're impeding patients' access to care. If cancer patients aren't being able to get into the hospital, that is just not on."" The issue of vaccinations and how to respond to the pandemic has been a mainstay of the federal campaign, which wraps up in one week on Sept. 20. Anti-vaccine and anti-mask protesters have dogged Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau along the campaign trail, even pelting him with gravel at one stop, after he promised to forge ahead with mandatory vaccination rules for travellers. Hours after Singh spoke, Trudeau outlined an identical pledge of criminal sanctions for anyone blocking access to hospitals, vaccine clinics, testing centres, pharmacies and abortion clinics, and those intimidating or harassing health-care workers. Speaking in Vancouver, Trudeau said the Criminal Code already has provisions about intimidating people who work in the justice system, but there is now a need to protect doctors and nurses in a similar way. ""It's not OK any day to know that a nurse going into a late shift crossing a parking lot might be afraid that there could be someone there to spit on her or shout obscenities at her,"" Trudeau said in his opening remarks. The Criminal Code also already prohibits intimidation, including using violence, uttering threats or watching someone's workplace, to prevent another person from doing something they have a lawful right to do. The Liberal leader took aim at Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole as Trudeau repeatedly looked to use the issue of vaccines and public health measures as a wedge. Speaking in the rural Ottawa suburb of Carp, O'Toole said the planned protests are ""completely unacceptable,"" and called for unity even as he denounced Trudeau with sharpened personal attacks. ""There is the ability to peacefully protest and things like this, but to harass and to try and block people from accessing health care in a pandemic is completely unacceptable,"" O'Toole said. ""Now is the time for us to work together, using all the tools we have — including vaccines, rapid tests, distancing, masks — in our fight against COVID-19. We need to come together as a country in this crisis, not divide ourselves."" Asked what he would do if elected, O'Toole said he trusted local officials to manage the situation. His party's platform does include a plank to create a Criminal Code offence for anyone interfering with ""critical infrastructure,"" which includes pipelines, rail lines, and, the party said, hospitals as well. Meanwhile, Green Party Leader Annamie Paul made a rare campaign stop outside of Toronto on Monday as she visited candidates in Prince Edward Island, a place where the Greens have made political inroads as the official Opposition in the provincial legislature. Paul pointed to that success and the dozen-plus pieces of legislation the provincial party has pushed as something voters in other parts of the country should consider when they cast a ballot.

"2021-09-16","Full text: While the debris from the site of an explosion in downtown Wheatley is expected to be cleared, the investigation into the source of a Hydrogen Sulphide gas leak continues. According to a news release from the municipality, debris from the site of the explosion last month will be taken to a landfill facility for proper disposal of any hazardous material such as asbestos. “There has been no detection of toxic, flammable gas since the explosion on August 26, 2021,” officials said. Chatham-Kent CAO Don Shropshire said posts on social media this week claiming that a decision has been made to demolish a number of buildings in the area are false. “The structural integrity of buildings in the vicinity of the blast has not been determined as of yet,” said Shropshire. “Municipal officials will take the appropriate action regarding structures when it is safe to do so.” Shropshire added that if residents have a question, they can ask it, and they will get answers to them as quickly as they can. “If you have a concern or heard a rumour, send us a question,” said Shropshire. There was still no timeline for when evacuated residents would be able to return home. The municipality continues to provide accommodation for nine households with 25 residents. The reception centre at the Wheatley Arena has had 194 visits from 95 unique households. The centre is open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily. “Right now, we are still removing the debris, which will make it easier for the ongoing investigation into the source of the gas leak,” said Shropshire. “With respect to getting access to the site, we still haven’t found the source, and until we do that, the site is not safe.” A mobile RBC unit has been established in the parking lot of the Wheatley Arena while the downtown RBC branch remains closed. Additionally, electricity has been turned off within the evacuation zone in downtown Wheatley. According to the municipality, natural gas was discovered near some Enbridge lines during the Labour Day Weekend. While it didn’t pose an immediate danger, the electricity was turned off to be safe. No more natural gas has been detected since. Chatham-Kent municipal employees and members of Chatham-Kent Fire and Emergency Services will now be contacting various Wheatley residents by phone, email and going door-to-door across the area over the course of the next few days to offer reassurance and answer questions and to assist residents with making an emergency plan and collecting information for the Municipal Evacuation Registry in case further evacuations are necessary. “Residents are being advised to have in place a family emergency plan and put together an emergency kit,” explained Fire Chief Chris Case. “As we have advised, work is still ongoing to find and manage the source of the gas, so we can’t say for sure that further evacuations won’t be necessary. Community safety remains a priority, so please be prepared.” Emergency kits include essential items a family needs to survive outside of their home should they be asked to leave. They include items such as food, water, important personal documents, medications needed, and a plan for pets. Residents who are not at home will have contact information left at their residence. Resources will also be available at the Reception Centre located at the Wheatley arena.

"2021-09-16","Full text: With just days remaining before Election Day, candidates in the Chatham-Kent-Leamington riding are pleading why they deserve your vote. The Ridgetown Independent reached out to candidates from the Liberal Party, Conservative Party, New Democratic Party, People’s Party of Canada, as well as the Green Party, to ask them about their plans on key topics. The questions were regarding whether or not the government should regulate social media as a means to prevent fake news and misinformation and if the government should increase environmental regulations on businesses to reduce carbon emissions. Mark Vercouteren, the Green Party candidate, said it is important that there is a system in place to ensure no fake accounts that spread lies and misinformation. “Freedom of speech is important but spreading misinformation has shown to not only ruin lives but end them,” said Vercouteren. Dave Epp, the Conservative Party candidate, said in a democratic society, abuses of power and authority can and should be called out without fear of retribution. “Canada’s Conservatives support creating a level playing field between large foreign streaming services and Canadian broadcasters and championing Canadian arts and culture,” said Epp. “A Conservative government would do so without compromising Canadians’ fundamental rights and freedoms.” Greg Hetherington, the Liberal Party candidate, believes in free speech but thinks people shouldn’t be able to misinform and share hate messages. He added that too many kids are being shamed by peers on social media sites, causing mental stress and an increase in suicide. “As a media owner, I see the impact that fake news and propaganda makes on the internet,” said Hetherington. “Too many times, people think they are reading information from a credible source, but instead, it’s misinformation. Secondly, for social media, we have a serious issue with our children.” Dan Gelinas, the NDP candidate, echoed Hetherington’s statement, pointing out there is already a system in place with the CRTC to handle any fake news and misinformation complaints. “The NDP supports factual and responsible journalism, and we certainly do not want to stifle free speech,” said Gelinas. “We do need to address these cutbacks to the CRTC and support more hiring and better funding in their efforts to combat fake news and misinformation.” However, not all candidates agree. The People’s Party of Canada candidate, Liz Vallee, said government control of any media platform is dangerous. She added the Liberals are trying to pass new censorship legislation, which she calls “extremely dangerous.” She said it would eliminate people’s right to free speech and expression. “Social media websites are privately owned entities and are not publicly funded,” said Vallee. “There are already laws in place to deal with issues like libel, slander, and content that might promote violence. Any government regulation beyond what is already in place should focus on preventing unwarranted censorship and ensuring non-discriminatory equal access to social media platforms.” Regarding whether or not the government should increase environmental regulations on businesses to reduce carbon emissions, Vallee said the short answer is no. “The long answer is that the government adding more red tape and more taxes is not going to produce innovation that will reduce carbon emissions,” said Vallee, who added that Canada has some of the world’s most strict environmental laws. “What we have seen with businesses is they often get sent to markets that do not have these regulations; thus, we keep polluting even more without really fixing anything and stifling our ability to make better technologies,” added the PPC candidate. “Usually, it is not the case that the government can regulate themselves out of a problem.” Hetherington, however, believes Canada needs to be a leader in Climate change. “It’s much easier to challenge other countries to make changes (such as China and India) who are big polluters,” The Liberal Party candidate said farmers are a good example. “I believe supporting our farmers with a rebate for creating thousands of acres of crops that eat carbon and produce oxygen should be a consideration for our next climate policy. Climate change is the biggest story of the century. We need to address it for our grandchildren and us.” According to Gelinas, the NDP supports the regulations already in place and has committed to cut emissions in half to meet the 1.5-degree target set by scientists to prevent future catastrophes. He added the NDP government would create 100’s of thousands of jobs by investing in clean energy, electric vehicles for transit and zero-emission cars. He pointed out that as a member of the G7, Canada is the only country whose emissions have gone up since the Paris Agreement and added that Canada has never met a single emissions reduction goal. “Increasing environmental regulations on business by making polluters pay their fair share to eliminate emissions is a first step in reducing carbon emissions,” said Gelinas. Epp said his party also has a plan to combat climate change. “Canada’s Conservatives have a serious plan to combat climate change that allows us to meet our targets and reduce emissions by 2030, all while repealing Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax,” said Epp. He added that the Conservatives recognize the most efficient way to reduce emissions is to use pricing mechanisms – but not one where the government pockets the money. According to Epp, Canada’s Conservatives are the only party with a plan to secure the environment, secure jobs, and secure the future. “We will fight climate change and protect the environment, but we won’t do it on the backs of hard-working Canadians or by hurting our economy,” said Epp. “Instead of sending your money to Ottawa, Low Carbon Savings Accounts help Canadians make greener lifestyle choices while allowing them to decide what works best for them and their family.” Vercouteren believes climate change is getting worse and should be taken seriously. “Our area is being affected by the climate change issues, and that will require a lot of money to fix. We need to put more effort into not just fixing these issues but to building an economy that works with the environment and local business,” said Vercouteren. According to the Green Party candidate, the pandemic has proven Canada can build a green economy. “By allowing more work from home, we have reduced the need to commute and provided better opportunities for people in our area for work. With more public transportation, we not only reduce our carbon footprint, but we also help the seniors in our area who are not able to drive,” said Vercouteren. He added his party could help create a business in the area that will add value to the products farmers produce, creating jobs, reducing shipping and providing more local products. “The flooding problems in our area can be reduced by more tree growth and wetlands, which also reduce our carbon footprint. We can make changes that not only help the environment but also improve our living standard and be healthier,” said Vercouteren. The 2021 Federal Elections is Monday, September 20.

"2021-09-15","Full text: A resident of Whitecourt for just over 27 years, Ray Hilts has spent the last four years working for the community as a member of Whitecourt Town Council. His interest in joining the political realm grew over the years as he watched policies come into play, such as caribou range planning. ""I recognized that political avenue was the best course of action in terms of influencing people and making sure outcomes were good for Whitecourt. I want people in Whitecourt to enjoy the lifestyle and the way of life we have here. We aren't like other communities. We are unique,"" he explained. Growing as a person and a politician, Hilts said that his mind has changed on things he once wasn't supportive of. ""When transit came in years ago, it was a plebiscite question during the election, and I voted against it. I thought it was just too big for a community our size, and I've come to learn that I was completely wrong."" He said that continuing to learn about the needs of community members and evolving from that is essential for any politician. ""I wasn't plugged in politically at the time and didn't have a sense for what the community needed. I just saw that we would spend a bunch of money. Honestly, my information was pretty limited, and I decided on limited information. When you get more engaged with those types of services or decisions, you think, wow, it was an important decision that was unpopular, and still is for sure, but I support it."" As a fiscal conservative, Hilts said he is happy to see the town's position financially. ""Your finances have to be healthy so you can be responsible in the future as a community. For me, that was important because if you are in a healthy place, you have flexibility, and you have more assurance around decisions you make in the future because you are not so tight with money."" When Hilts first moved to Whitecourt in 1994, he was a city boy moving to a small town. ""Whitecourt is known, certainly in the forestry industry, as a great place to work. I ended up quitting a permanent job with the Alberta government to take on a contract position with Millar Western in hopes that it would work out, and it did. Whitecourt is a great place to raise a family."" With his wife Tracy, Hilts has two sons, 12, 17. An avid cyclist, Hilts has a history of competitive racing under his belt. ""You're racing in the 30 to 40 kilometre an hour range. When you race, you don't get the luxury of doing it at your pace,"" laughed Hilts. ""Crashes are not uncommon, and they are super dangerous."" In 2013, a crash unfolded in front of him. ""The rider in front of me crashed, and I tried to leapfrog him but ended up going over and smacking my head on the pavement. That's a note to kids to wear their helmets because had I not had mine on, I probably would have been a vegetable!"" Work ethic and perseverance will be essential attributes for whoever wins the mayor's chair, and Hilts feels that he has proven his worth. ""I believe I have the skillset and passion for the community and the challenges we face, whether COVID, financial issues, and larger policy issues in terms of the economy. I want to be part of that."" Through his work within industry and over the last four years on council, Hilts said that he built relationships regionally, provincially and federally. ""That's the major responsibility of the job is to be active and present with all levels of government to get Whitecourt's needs addressed. I've done much of that already through different avenues of my career."" As one of seven people working to support a vision for Whitecourt, Hilts has ideas in mind, four pillars, that he will be bringing forward to the new council should he be successful in the election. The first is Building Up Partnerships and Relationships. ""The relationship with Woodlands County now is certainly not what he has been in previous years. I have heard loud and clear from the business community and people that we need some harmony there and rational, stable governance so that businesses can flourish, and we have a better community to live in."" The second is Economic Development. ""We've seen through COVID the harm that it has placed on our businesses and community. I'm proud of the work that our town has done and organizations like Community Futures Yellowhead East and Whitecourt's Chamber of Commerce."" As to the proposed Municipal Centre, Hilts said he wants to see it on the ballot as a plebiscite. ""I want to make sure our residents have a say. Residents need to know that, though we have spent money on a business plan and designs and location, a decision has not yet been made on proceeding with this facility."" Hilt's third pillar is Seniors Care and Housing. He said that the new Christenson Development will help reduce wait times for seniors wanting into facilities but that there is still a lower income bracket of the population to serve. His final pillar is Community Social Services. He said that continuing to lobby for a new hospital or funding upgrades needs to be a priority, as does addressing and serving Whitecourt's homeless. When asked what a vote for Ray Hilts would mean in the October election, Hilts said it would mean getting a leader who encourages ideas and encourages collaboration. ""You'll get a mayor that wants to see evidence of progress on programs and services. You'll get a mayor who is always interested and willing to talk to residents and genuinely listen to their needs and who always has the time of day for you on any issue.""

"2021-09-14","Full text: Leaders spar over how to fund campaign pledges OTTAWA - The fifth and final week of the federal election campaign kicked off Sunday with the Liberals and New Democrats each questioning whether their opponent's plan to pay for the billions of campaign spending promises was based in reality. The New Democrats are promising a far-ranging plan to create social programs like pharmacare and dental care through $214 billion in new spending over five years. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is vowing to pay for some of it by raking in $166 billion in new revenues by taxing the super-rich and ultra-profitable corporations. The numbers are far higher than those in the Liberal platform, which similarly proposes new taxes like raising the corporate rate levied on bank earnings over $1 billion to help fund programs intended to boost recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking on Montreal's South Shore, Trudeau took aim at the NDP over that party's plans to raise billions in new revenues, suggesting there is a ceiling to how much a government can tax the wealthy. ""We have to make sure that the wealthiest are paying their full and fair share and we've done significant things towards that,"" Trudeau said. ""But the idea that you can go with unlimited zeal against the successful and wealthy in this country to pay for everything else is an idea that reaches its limits at one point, and I don't think the NDP get that."" Singh countered that Trudeau's vision was limited. During a campaign stop in Sudbury, Ont., He argued Trudeau has given the wealthy a free ride during the Liberal leader's six years as prime minister by not collecting billions in potential revenues. ""I'm not surprised that he said that, 'oh, limit your hopes and aspirations around making sure that billionaires pay their fair share.' I've long been saying he's been defending the super-rich, he's on the side of the billionaires, and that's just more evidence of it,"" Singh said. The parliamentary budget officer has warned there is only so much space to add new spending on federal books before deficits become a problem to rein in. Only Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole is pledging to balance the budget, and that's within a decade. The Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa flagged the Conservative balanced-budget promise in its analysis of the party's spending plans. The group, headed by former parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page, wrote that the Conservative pledge to boost health transfers to provinces could ""put the balanced budget target and long-term fiscal sustainability at significant risk."" Speaking in Vancouver, O'Toole said his party's fiscal plan was ""disciplined but fair"" and pointed to the current budget officer's evaluation to support the Conservative platform estimates. ""The parliamentary budget officer confirmed our plan. We submitted 30 different policies for his analysis,"" O'Toole said. ""We will balance the budget within the decade."" The comments marked the start of the final push as each party is looking to both bolster support on the Sept. 20 election day, but also persuade voters heading to advance polls this weekend. Elections Canada said early estimates show more than 1.3 million voters cast their ballot in-person on the first day of advance polls on Friday, which is more than what was recorded during the 2019 election. With polls suggesting a tight race, the leaders have elbowed for room and ratcheted up the rhetoric in what's been an emotional campaign that has shown little sign of cooling down. The Liberal candidate in the Saskatchewan riding of Regina-Wascana, Sean McEachern, had dog feces thrown on his windshield while campaigning Thursday, while Chris Bittle, the Liberal candidate in the Ontario riding of St. Catharines, tweeted a photo Sunday of his car that had ""FU Liberals"" spray-painted on it overnight. Trudeau looked Sunday to lay blame for tensions at the feet of Maxime Bernier, the leader of the People's Party of Canada, which polls suggest has steadily seen a rise in national support. Trudeau, like Bloc Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet and O'Toole, dismissed any concerns that Bernier's candidates could siphon support from their parties. While Singh said he disagreed with many of Bernier's views, the NDP leader added that he understands the general feeling of frustration and cynicism some voters have with federal politics after seeing governments fail to live up to campaign promises.

"2021-09-14","Full text: University of New Brunswick third-year biology student Meriet Gray Miller faced a more extensive than anticipated schedule when he returned to college in Fredericton this year. In addition to taking on his university study load, the 20-year-old Upper Kent resident agreed to accept the nomination as NDP candidate for the Tobique-Mactaquac riding. Despite his youth, the 2021 federal election is not Gray Miller's first campaign. He represented the Carleton-Victoria NDP in the 2020 provincial election. Neither is Gray Miller the youngest candidate on the Tobique-Mactaquac ballot. The Green Party chose 19-year-old Anthony Martin to carry their banner. ""Part of my goal when I ran as a 19-year-old was to get other young people to run,"" he laughed. ""I guess it's working out well."" While his return to university limits his time on the hustings, Gray Miller said he's proud to provide Tobique-Mactaquac with a viable NDP option. ""I think the NDP is offering the best deal for Canadians and the best deal to improve our lives,"" he said. ""It has policies to help Canadians move out of poverty and improve the quality of lives for all Canadians."" Among the many challenges voters now face, Gray Miller said the critical issue, upon which most others issues depend, is recovering from the COVID-induced recession. ""Getting our economy back on track,"" he said. ""How are we going to get money back into people's pockets? How do we pay down the deficit? How do we switch to green energy without losing jobs? The economy and trade are probably the most important issues in this election for a lot of people."" While the debt and deficit present a challenge, Gray Miller believes a lack of productivity hinders Canada compared to other countries, including developing nations. He said other countries found success by spending heavily on infrastructure, noting that many nations invest five to 10 per cent of their GDP on infrastructure. ""Increasing spending on infrastructure correlates to a pretty rapid increase in GDP. It's better transportation, better communication networks,"" Gray Miller said. ""Get jobs to market quicker. Provides jobs that are more distant, jobs that pay better. More jobs in rural areas."" He said investment in infrastructure is a crucial component of the NDP's economic recovery plan. While tax increases are part of the NDP plan, he said, lower and middle-income Canadians won't bear the burden. Gray Miller said his party's focus would be on wealth tax and capital gains, noting Canada's highest earners are not paying their fair share. ""The trouble is, there's a lot of money in Canada that should be spent on public services that are just being hoarded in offshore bank accounts."" While his schedule limited his opportunities to get around the extensive riding to talk to voters, Gray Miller said university life gives him a chance to talk to youth, many of whom are from Tobique-Mactaquac communities. He said area youth's biggest concern is the lack of a future, with fewer job opportunities and little growth in wages. ""For young and working people, the decreasing affordability and increasing cost of living is a concern,"" Gray Miller said. He said health care remains a significant issue for most voters, whether it's concern about access or the cost of prescriptions. For that reason, Gray Miller fully endorses his party's pharmacare program, which will make easy access to life-saving medicine available to all income groups. He added that a pharmacare program would deliver significant savings to employers. Gray Miller said the NDP supports the Liberal government's recently released day-care program. Still, his party would like to take it further by providing funds to increase day-care spots and provide other facilities for Canadian children. He pointed to his small community of Upper Kent as an example, explaining children don't have a public park, basketball court or baseball diamond. He said the NDP wants to provide more educational and recreational opportunities for children, wherever they live. Gray Miller said Indigenous rights need to be near the top of the priority list in Tobique-Mactaquac, noting four First Nations are in or near the riding. In addition to acting upon the Truth and Reconciliation report recommendations, Gray Miller said the NDP would support First Nation communities. ""The Liberals don't do it because they don't want to, because there's no money to be made in it. The reserves that are getting the most amount of money are those who agree to play nicely with the Liberal government. The ones who agree invest it in business opportunities the Liberals enjoy.

"2021-09-14","Full text: Retired Sussex-area school teacher Cully Robinson doesn't currently live in Tobique-Mactaquac, but he plans to move to the riding if he wins the Sept. 20 election. And Robinson added, he intends to serve all voters' needs by being the voice of constituents in Ottawa. He said MPs must be accessible and visible, something he suggests is not happening under incumbent Conservative MP Richard Bragdon. Robinson — who ran unsuccessfully as the candidate for Sussex-Fundy-St. Martins in last year's provincial election — accepted the nomination when asked by the Tobique-Mactaquac Liberal Riding Association. ""I believe everyone has a civic duty to vote,"" he said. ""And if asked to run, if you have the time and ability to do it, you should stand."" In his travels throughout Tobique-Mactaquac, Robinson said he found voters raising concerns about several issues with global warming, health care, housing for young people, and economic development topping the list. He said health care appears to be the top issue, followed closely by climate change. While acknowledging health care is a provincial purview, Robinson said the federal government controls funding, noting his party will increase health-care transfers and invest in other health-related programs. At the same time, he said, money must be spent as planned. ""We have to ask really tough questions about how that money is spent,"" he said. He said New Brunswick must re-examine health care spending and operation. ""The way our health care is being run seems to be extinguishing services, not supporting them,"" Robinson said. ""And, that's a concern. During conversations in the riding, Robinson said, he heard over and over about the shortage of nurses and the lack of fair wages for health-care workers. He also believes it's catamount to maintain health delivery as a public service and avoid the encroachment of private health delivery. ""Universal health care defines us as a nation,"" said Robinson Regarding climate change, he said, his biggest concern is the lack of concern within the Conservative ranks, noting many ""climate deniers"" within the Conservative Party of Canada. ""That's ridiculous in this day and age,"" Robinson said. The Liberal hopeful said his party's climate-change platform earned praise from experts, including Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada. Robinson said the Liberal plan understands the importance of reducing carbon emissions and reaching the goals it set. While federal policies play the central role in addressing the climate crisis, he said, it requires a combined effort from all levels of government, along with industry and small business. ""Levels of government don't exist in vacuums,"" he said. ""Municipal governments, MLAs, MPs, all levels of government have to work together."" He said corporations, small businesses and individuals are looking for support in searching for alternative energy options. Calling small business the backbone of the economy, Robinson said the government must help them meet climate change challenges and help them overcome workforce shortages. ""Our employers need skilled labourers, skilled managers, and this has to have a multi-level effort working from municipal to federal levels,"" he said. Robinson said the feds must partner with the province to develop an immigration process to meet workforce needs. He said Canada also needs a multi-level effort to provide affordable education to train people to meet employment demands. Robinson said the Liberals understand the fiscal challenges involved in protecting Canadians and restarting the economy. ""We've come through a period where our government has our backs,"" he said. ""We had to go to a wartime footing. That's going to be ongoing for some time. We have to preserve and defend our economy and our citizens."" He said that it wouldn't require increased taxes for low and middle-income groups, but it requires a review of the tax levels of Canada's wealthiest. ""We have to ensure everyone is paying their fair share of taxes,"" Robinson said. Subject: Small business; Local elections; Health care policy; Climate change"
"2021-09-14","Full text: Tobique-Mactaquac incumbent Richard Bragdon, who described himself as an optimist, said he prefers the balanced, measured and positive approach of his leader Erin O'Toole to the fearmongering of political opponents as he seeks re-election on Sept. 20. Bragdon faced an unusual and shortened first term in office since his election in 2019. After only five weeks in the House of Commons, the COVID-19 pandemic forced most parliamentary business to be carried out over Zoom. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cut Bragdon's first term short when he called the early fall election to the chagrin of most of the MPs outside the Liberal caucus. Trudeau's critics panned the prime minister for heading to the polls in the heart of dual crises — the pandemic and the Afghanistan withdrawal. Bragdon believes Trudeau and the Liberal then launched a campaign intended to divide Canadians. The sitting Tobique-Mactaquac MP acknowledged that climate change is one of the significant issues in the current campaign but doesn't want to describe it as a ""crisis."" Bragdon said those using the word are intentionally trying to make climate change a wedge issue. He said Canada faces climate challenges and climate situations around the world. ""Every time people use 'crisis,' we're putting people under so much pressure,"" Bragdon said. He said the government must address climate change quickly but with hope and understanding, not fear. ""Stop using climate change as a wedge issue,"" Bragdon said. Allowing emotion to enter the debate on reducing carbon emissions creates divisions, not solutions, he said, noting people have to stop blaming the resource sector and recognize fossil fuel companies are often leaders in carbon reduction technology. Bragdon recommends building consensus as the best way to tackle climate change. ""We all want a better planet to leave to the next generation,"" he said. Bragdon said the Conservatives have a solid climate-change plan which protects vital economic sectors while advancing clean technology and fuels. He added carbon emissions are a world problem in which Canada plays a minimal role. ""We're such an overall small contributor to overall greenhouse emissions as compared to China and India,"" Bragdon said. He said the Liberal government intentionally created wedge issues in other areas, including handling the C-6, a bill to ban conversion therapy, a process to force children to change their sexual identity. After voting for the bill on second reading, Bragdon voted against it on third reading. Although it passed, the MP says the Liberals delayed introducing it late in the session, knowing it would die on the order paper when Parliament dissolved. Bragdon said O'Toole committed to re-introducing the bill if they form the government and add the amendments that ensure it doesn't sweep up people for conversations. ""All MPs are against harmful practices,"" he said. A highlight of Bragdon's first term as MP was the passage of his private member's bill to reduce recidivism in Canada's penal system. While private member's bills rarely pass, Bragdon's bill gained bipartisan support. It calls on the justice minister to study the issues and best practices to develop a program to better prepare prisoners to re-enter society. Bragdon said the issue he hears about most on Tobique-Mactaquac doorsteps is health care. He said his government is committed to doubling the health transfer and providing provinces with the resources to improve the system. Bragdon reaffirmed his party is committed to universal health care, saying opponents claiming otherwise are again practising divisive politics. Bragdon said leadership is another big issue for Tobique-Mactaquac voters. He said people want to know who's best to lead Canadians through the pandemic and come out safely on the other side. He believes O'Toole offers the experience and temperament to deal with the challenges, and he ""came forward with a positive, foolproof recovery plan."" Bragdon said the plan encourages Canada to become much more self-reliant and expand our sectors that have so much growth potential, whether in agriculture, manufacturing, resource and energy development or other sectors. Bragdon expressed confidence the Tory platform will successfully steer Canada to better economic times. He believes O'Toole is the person to lead the way, especially compared to the current prime minister. ""I like that contrast Mr. O'Toole is offering hopeful, reasonable, solid leadership based upon a lifetime of experience,"" he said. Bragdon said O'Toole has a plan to return to a balanced budget over the next decade. In contrast, he said, Trudeau doesn't seem to have a plan to ever return to a balanced budget.

"2021-09-14","Full text: People are living in fear, says Daniel Waggoner, the Fredericton businessman running as the Tobique-Mactaquac candidate for the People's Party of Canada in the Sept. 20 federal election. Not only has the Trudeau government and the media promoted fear and overhyped the dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic, those who disagree with the government message fear the loss of their freedom, Waggoner said. He said government-induced fear was the critical issue in the federal election. He noted PPC's poll numbers continue to rise, putting them past the Green Party and closing in on the NDP. ""That speaks volumes,"" Waggoner said. ""People are worried about their freedom."" He said mothers approach him on the campaign trail, telling them they are worried about the children. He said they don't want their children living in fear while being forced to wear masks and stay away from their friends. Waggoner dismisses the suggestion that vaccines are the only solution, noting people have the right to get vaccinated or not. He sees vaccine mandates and passports as a direct attack on Canadian freedoms. ""The current government throws a lot of money at our CBC media cartel to scare people into being afraid of each other,"" he said. Waggoner said the vaccine debate only magnified that debate and the divisions. ""Not only are they afraid of each other, but now they are afraid of the unclean, unvaxed, which to me is wrong,"" he said. ""If you have not been vaccinated, you're not unclean."" Waggoner said the virus is a severe threat to a few, but he wants the government to keep the danger in perspective by exercising common sense and providing honest answers. ""There's no denying COVID-19 pandemic is real. There's no denying SARS-COV-2 virus is deadly to certain people for sure,"" he said. ""Especially the elderly, people with serious ailments and people near death. That's just the statistics."" Waggoner said the virus is no threat to people like himself. ""I exercise. I eat well. I get lots of Vitamin D. I get lots of sun. I take zinc supplements,"" he said. ""But our government has not said anything about any of this. All they said is the only way out of this is a vaccine."" Waggoner dismissed the numbers in New Brunswick ICU beds, describing the four people currently under ICU care as an insignificant number on a large scale. He said people end up in ICU with the common flu, adding the government doesn't mandate the flu shot. Waggoner said while governments spend billions on a vaccine with a low mortality rate, 50,000 children a day globally die of starvation. Waggoner also questions the hype surrounding climate change, noting climates have permanently changed. He said climate change used to be called global warming. ""Global warming and global cooling happen,"" he said. Waggoner acknowledged the climate is changing but admits he is not sure of all the reasons. ""How much driving cars and cows play a role in that,"" he said. ""I don't know."" While questioning climate change, Waggoner said he recognizes the importance of being good environmental stewards and taking care of the planet. He said human action puts the earth in danger, whether it's plastics in the ocean or the threat of extinction of animal species. He said that the PPC understands a solid environmental policy would protect the earth for future generations. During his travels around New Brunswick, Waggoner said he could see the demand for workers. He admits he doesn't have all the answers, noting the problem needs close study. He believes working people are available but need to be connected to work opportunities. He doesn't see increased immigration as the answer, noting that most new immigrants depend on government assistance and are not part of the workforce. He said Canada's already generous emigration policies would see the workforce filled if that was the answer. If Canada turns to immigration to fill the void, Waggoner said, it needs to focus on the educated and those with required skills. As he travels the riding, Waggoner said he enjoyed a positive response to his message. ""I believe people are more socially conservative and in line with the PPC's policy beliefs,"" he said.

"2021-09-14","Full text: SNC-Lavalin affair re-emerges on campaign trail OTTAWA - Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau denied wanting Jody Wilson-Raybould to lie as the SNC-Lavalin affair — which figured prominently in the last election — burst back onto the campaign trail Saturday with the publication of an excerpt of the former justice minister's memoir. The excerpt from the tell-all book ""Indian in the Cabinet"" — published in the Globe and Mail — came as the NDP revealed the cost of platform over the next five years, and police in London, Ont., charged a man in connection with a gravel throwing incident against Trudeau. In the excerpt, Wilson-Raybould recalls two critical meetings with Trudeau in February 2019, days after the Globe reported Canada’s first Indigenous justice minister had faced inappropriate pressure from top Liberals in a court case. That case was the criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, which was facing bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. Wilson-Raybould would later testify that senior party leaders wanted her as attorney-general to stop the prosecution for political reasons. The full memoir is due to be released on Tuesday. Wilson-Raybould says the meetings were held in Vancouver a few days after the Globe story broke. The prime minister was facing pressure after saying the paper’s report was false. Wilson-Raybould says she was pushing for transparency with Canadians — and some level of accountability. “He used the line that would later become public, that I had ‘experienced things differently,’” she writes. “I knew what he was really asking. What he was saying. In that moment, I knew he wanted me to lie — to attest that what had occurred had not occurred. ... Lie to protect a Crown government acting badly; a political party; a leader who was not taking responsibility.” Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet the next day and was followed out the door by then-health minister Jane Philpott before the two were booted from Liberal caucus. The affair later led Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick to resign. Following the excerpt’s publication, the issue exploded onto the campaign trail Saturday as Trudeau denied wanting the former justice minister to lie while his opponents praised Wilson-Raybould and held up her account as further proof the Liberal leader can’t be trusted. “I did not want her to lie,” Trudeau said during a campaign event in Mississauga, Ont., where he started his public remarks by honouring the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. “I would never do that. I would never ask her that. That is simply not true.” The Liberal leader sought to instead turn the page on the issue by noting the entire affair was the subject of countless parliamentary committee hearings, newspaper articles and other commentary in the lead up to, and during, the last federal election in October 2019. Trudeau has previously refused to apologize for his handling of the affair, including after the ethics commissioner found in August 2019 that he violated the Conflict of Interest Act by improperly using his position to pressure Wilson-Raybould to benefit SNC-Lavalin’s private interests. “It's unfortunate when two people who share a very similar vision for building a better future end up falling out, end up going in separate ways. I genuinely, obviously, regret how it ended up,” Trudeau said on Saturday. “But I don't regret the things that I chose to do to stand up for Canadians and move forward because every step of the way, that's what has to guide me. That's my responsibility as prime minister.” Yet even as Trudeau tried to put a plug in the issue, Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole seized on the excerpt to attack his chief rival’s credibility. ""Mr. Trudeau will say and do anything to win, and never has any intention of actually putting Canadians and the needs of the country first,” O'Toole said during a campaign stop in Whitby, Ont., where he also marked the 20th anniversary of 9/11. “Canadians no longer believe Justin Trudeau. We saw with how he treated Jody Wilson-Raybould, how he put the interests of a corporate entity lobbying about a judicial proceeding ahead of doing the right thing.” Both O’Toole and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also sought to use the re-emergence of the SNC-Lavalin affair as a way to remind Canadians about what they allege is Trudeau’s hypocrisy when it comes to his treatment of strong women in cabinet and government. “That's another example of this pattern of behavior that we're seeing from Mr. Trudeau, of kicking out strong women in his cabinet, whether it was his previous justice minister, or whether it was minister Philpott,” Singh said in Vancouver. “We've seen this as a trend, and it's troubling.” Singh, meanwhile, faced questions about why his party was only releasing its costed platform — which proposes tens of billions more in spending than the Liberals and Conservatives — nine days before election day and after some voters across the country had already cast advance ballots. The Conservatives released their costed plan last Saturday while the Liberals led the way on Sept. 1. “We said clearly we're going to make the billionaires pay their fair share and we've been really clear about investing in the programs that people need,” he said. “This document is exactly what we've been saying all along, with more details."" The NDP plan would invest $214 billion in new programs over the next five years, compared to $78 billion in planned new spending by the Liberals and $58 billion from the Tories. Much of that will go to universal pharmacare, Indigenous communities and fighting climate change. The party says it would pay for those promises through tax measures aimed at the wealthy and corporations, with plans to raise a total of $166 billion by 2025-26. The NDP says the revenue projections and some of the spending items have been costed by the parliamentary budget officer. The PBO in its reports acknowledged uncertainty when it came to the revenue figures. While the leaders were continuing to stump their way across parts of the country, London police announced they had charged 25-year-old Shane Marshall of St. Thomas, Ont., with one count of assault with a weapon after someone threw gravel at Trudeau during a local campaign stop. Earlier this week, the People's Party of Canada said it removed a man named Shane Marshall from the post of Elgin-Middlesex-London riding association president, but did not immediately respond to request for comment on whether he and the man facing charges are one and the same. The Liberal party declined to comment on the arrest. And while some Canadians cast their ballots at advance polls over the weekend, polls in three Newfoundland ridings were closed indefinitely after hurricane Larry battered the eastern part of the island. Elections Canada said there were no plans to add extra days for the advance polls.

"2021-09-13","Full text: In an election most Canadians do not want, nobody got anything of substance from political leaders who clashed against one another in last night’s only English-language television debate. Hyped as a pivotal moment for undecided voters in the final stretch of the campaign, the crucial issue of immigration or challenges faced by newcomers got no airtime. Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Green Party Leader Annamie Paul and Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet all attacked Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau for calling an election during a pandemic and the Afghanistan crisis. Trudeau, appearing agitated and taking fire from all sides, did not muster much of a response other than saying Canadians must “make a choice” about which leaders’ plan is best for the future. “I’m still undecided after watching the debate, because I don’t think there was that one moment that was a game changer,” said Paula Arab, a Vancouver-based media and communications strategist, who is an undecided voter. “Overall, the one who seemed most prime ministerial was O’Toole, while Trudeau was desperate. Beyond that, there wasn’t enough substance to really make an informed decision,” she said. The two-hour debate covered five themes – affordability, climate, COVID recovery, leadership and accountability/reconciliation – and was moderated by Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, with the participation of journalists Rosemary Barton, Melissa Ridgen, Evan Solomon, and Mercedes Stephenson. Kurl had to preside over a format decided upon by the Debate Broadcast Group, which resulted in chaotic cross-talk, party leaders interrupting each other with prepared one-liners and little in the way of substantive discussion on what matters most to Canadians. “This moderator did a great job keeping the leaders in line and on topic. She ran a tight ship,” said Arab. Alex Martyniak, the executive director of the EU Chamber of Commerce in Canada – West, said Kurl stood out the most among all those on stage. “One would hope one day she will stand on the other side answering the questions,” he said. Kurl, however, came under fire from Bloc Quebecois’ Blanchet for her opening question directed at him about Quebec’s Bill 21 “secularism” law which restricts the wearing of ‘religious symbols’ by public servants in positions of authority such as teachers, police officers, judges, and lawyers. Blanchet, bristling at the question, answered that “those laws are not about discrimination, they are about the values of Quebec,” and then went on to say “you may repeat as many times as you like that those are discriminatory laws,” before adding later that he has no interest in leading Canada. The question and response has given Blanchet’s Bloc Quebecois, a regional party that wants Quebec to be recognized as a nation, a much needed wedge issue to portray themselves as the protectors of the people of Quebec. Current polls have suggested Trudeau’s Liberals could take as many as 41 Quebec seats, an increase from the 35 seats they won in the 2019 election. “The Bloc will likely benefit from this exchange, as it wants a minority government to give it more autonomy,” said Gurmant Grewal, a former Conservative MP, who represented the Surrey riding of Fleetwood—Port Kells from 2004 to 2015. Rating the performance of the leaders in the debate, Gurpreet Singh, a South Asian radio talk show host and political commentator said Trudeau portrayed a lack of confidence in his answers while O’Toole remained calm during the debate and came across as a reasoned politician. “Singh and Paul did a far better job than I expected and brought a different dynamic to the leadership debate being from visible minority backgrounds. “Paul should also get credit for taking on everyone on issues of systemic racism and reconciliation, including the so-called progressives like Singh and Trudeau, but they were better when answering questions coming from voters directly,” he said. Beyond the fiery exchanges, one other name stood out in the debate. Many of the leaders referred to Jody Wilson-Raybould, who served as justice and veterans affairs minister before being expelled from the Liberal caucus following the SNC-Lavalin scandal in 2019. Wilson-Raybould, who has become a fierce critic of the government and sat as an Independent following her expulsion from the Liberal Party, is not running for re-election. Paul mentioned Wilson-Raybould to challenge Trudeau’s self-proclaimed identity as a feminist while O’Toole referenced her when talking about building partnerships with First Nations. Wilson-Raybould’s book – “Indian” in the Cabinet: Speaking Truth to Power – comes out next Tuesday and is expected to provide fodder to attack Trudeau’s record in the stretch run to polling day on Sept 20."

"2021-09-13","Full text: This is the fifth of five profiles of candidates for the Kootenay-Columbia riding. There is still work to be done, according to Rob Morrison. The incumbent Member of Parliament for Kootenay-Columbia — which includes Nelson — is taking another run for the riding as a candidate on the Conservative Party ticket. Morrison gained the most votes in the 2019 federal election — defeating NDP incumbent Wayne Stetski — and has set the stage for another ballot box battle on Sept. 20 with the two confirmed for the 2021 version. In his time with the Conservative Party Morrison worked in the shadows, accepting the role of deputy shadow minister for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, as well as taking on the role of Conservative shadow minister for National Security. In his time as the Kootenay-Columbia MP, Morrison traveled “extensively to remote communities and areas throughout” the riding, attempting to understand the real issues residents and business owners were facing. “He values relationships and is continuously building bridges and solutions between government, communities, and the thousands of constituents he represents with pride,” noted his campaign website (https://voterobmorrison.ca/about/). Like his counterpart in the election — Stetski — Morrison has spent over 35 years in employment as a public official. His father served in the Royal Canadian Air Force, which gave him “wide-ranging exposure to the Canadian landscape,” and led Morrison into work in many leadership roles and, as he said, “forging strong collaborative relationships within government.” Morrison eventually attained the position as director general with the Treasury Board Secretariat where he was responsible for an information-sharing environment with all law enforcement agencies and foreign governments. Prior to that role Morrison was senior executive chief superintendent with the RCMP in British Columbia, as well as a diplomat with the Department of Foreign Affairs where he was responsible for 17 countries in central/southwest Asia and the Middle East, and engaged firsthand with senior foreign government officials representing the voice of Canada. Through his government work Morrison received multiple recognitions, including a Commissioner’s Commendation for Outstanding Service and recognition from the Prime Minister for his years of public service. The 2021 federal election goes Sept. 20. The candidates currently include a roster of five: • Rob Morrison - Conservative Party (https://voterobmorrison.ca/about/); • Wayne Stetski - New Democratic Party (https://www.facebook.com/Stetski/); • Robin Goldsbury – Liberal Party (https://www.robingoldsbury.ca/); • Rana Nelson – Green Party (https://www.greenparty.ca/en/riding/2013-59015); and • Sarah Bennett, People’s Party of Canada (https://kootenayppc.ca/kootenay-columbia-ppc-candidate-sarah-bennett/) Subject: Elections; Political parties"

They also decided by a narrow margin that the parliament should have limited power to levy taxes. In 1997, Canada's federal and provincial health ministers reached a deal for a new blood agency (Canadian Blood Services) after the federal government agreed to pay a significant amount of its setup cost. The new blood authority replaced the Canadian Red Cross Society. In 1998, the report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was made public in Washington. It alleged 11 acts by U.S. President Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair that might constitute grounds for impeachment, including perjury and obstruction of justice. In 2001, hijackers crashed two airplanes into New York's World Trade Center, toppling its twin 110-storey towers. Not long after, another hijacked plane slammed into the Pentagon in suburban Washington and a fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania after passengers on board fought with hijackers. Approximately 3,000 people were killed in the four crashes, including two dozen Canadians. The attacks were blamed on Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, who was living in Afghanistan under the protection of that country's Taliban government. The U.S. responded by organizing an international coalition to drive the Taliban from power and find bin Laden, who was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan on May 2, 2011. In 2002, quarterback Johnny Unitas, who broke nearly every passing NFL record and won three championships with the Baltimore Colts in an 18-year career, died at age 69. In 2003, John Ritter, whose portrayal of the bumbling but lovable Jack Tripper helped make the television comedy series ""Three’s Company"" a smash hit in the 1970s, died at age 54. In 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi won a landslide victory in Japan’s national elections. In 2008, Montreal's archbishop Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte, 72, renounced his Order of Canada to protest Dr. Henry Morgentaler's appointment to the prestigious membership. In 2009, a Taiwan court imposed a life sentence on former president Chen Shui-bian after convicting him of corruption. In 2015, a massive crane collapsed in a storm and crashed onto the Grand Mosque in Mecca, killing 111 people and injuring nearly 400. In 2016, Stan Wawrinka defeated defending champ Novak Djokovic 6-7 (1), 6-4, 7-5, 6-3 for his first U.S. Open trophy and third Grand Slam title overall. In 2018, Nova Scotia introduced legislation banning the use of conversion therapy for LGBTQ youth under 16. Conversion therapy attempts to change a person's sexual orientation. In 2018, a member of the Manitoba legislature and former federal cabinet minister took over the leadership of the Manitoba Party. Steven Fletcher had been kicked out of the provincial Progressive Conservative caucus for publicly breaking with the party on a number of policies, including voting against a bill to create a Crown corporation on Energy efficiency. In 2019, Justin Trudeau began his bid for re-election by framing the 40-day campaign as a time for Canadians to make a choice: whether they want more of his sunny ways or a return to the gloomier days he says are characteristic of life under a Conservative government. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the election would come down to a clear question for voters: Who can you count on? Green party Leader Elizabeth May said her party was hoping to capitalize on interest in tackling climate change, as well as a growing number of Green politicians elected in recent provincial votes. Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Fancois Blanchet said voters in Quebec had flirted with three parties in recent years, none of whom has done enough for the province."

"2021-09-13","Full text: Dawson City will be electing a new mayor on Oct. 21. Wayne Potoroka, who served three terms on council before serving three terms as mayor, will not be putting his name forward for another three-year term. He looks forward to a new generation of municipal leaders helping set the direction for the town. “This isn’t a lifetime job,”’ Potoroka said on Sept. 7. “You’ve got to be encouraging the next group to be stepping up. That’s important.” Potoroka also said, “I don’t think I’m done. Maybe there will be a chance for me to come back in some other iteration. I’m not sure. But right now, I just think it would be great to see the next generation step up and pull the cart for a while.” Potoroka wanted to make two things clear — one, that even though public service processes take time, serving is immensely worthwhile; and two, that Dawson City needs more lots. The two points are related. On the first matter, he says that public service is “super rewarding. You can get lots of things done, you can do things and impact change that really means something to people.” On the second, he said “We’ve got to bring lots to market so that the next generation of Dawsonites and those living here right now, have a place to sink some roots. “That is core to all of our issues, in my opinion, making sure that you have space for new neighbors and to preserve the properties of those that are already living here as well.” Potoroka believes that Dawson made some strides that acted as a bit of a relief valve to alleviate some housing pressures and to buy some time, but is clear that “we are not keeping up.” Ongoing studies by the Klondike Development Corporation report a huge housing supply gap. As well, a recently commissioned report by Stantec on the best use of a downtown city block states “the supply of building lots in Dawson City has been restricted for so long that the supply of 20 new residential building lots will be nowhere near sufficient to offset pent-up and future demand.” “At a time when mortgage borrowing rates are at 50-year lows, the acute shortage of building lots in Dawson City is resulting in an entire generation of young Dawson residents being shut out of homeownership opportunities,” the report continued. “That is really hard to read,” said Potoroka. “Generations of Dawson kids haven’t been able to access that opportunity because there’s no land.” Dawson signed a land development protocol agreement with the territorial government eight years ago hoping to pull some land planning expertise into the community. “I know they’re overworked. But it’s just been a long time. It’s been over a quarter of a century since we’ve seen some significant development. “I think that 555 kilometres is a difficult gap to overcome sometimes,” mulled Potoroka. “But I think that we’ve got to get better at it. It’s got to be faster.” He believes the two levels of government need to find a better way forward. “We are not constrained by geography; we are constrained by a lack of imagination.” But the hardest part is the speed with which things sometimes move. Still, Potoroka, with his combination of gravitas and optimism, is convinced that municipal government is the one level of government where you can actually get things accomplished. And so, for those who are thinking of running in the upcoming election? Potoroka firmly believes that municipal government is “a meaningful experience, that will leave them feeling enriched and fulfilled and rewarded in many ways.” After over 15 years in municipal governance, Potoroka says the rewards for future leaders are many. “Not the least of which is building a community that they want to live in.” Subject: Local elections"
"2021-09-13","Full text: Unlike the federal leaders' debate, candidates participating in GreenPAC’s 100 Debates for the Environment this week were able to give thoughtful, clear answers and respectful rebuttals, the non-profit environmental organization’s executive director said. “There was a lot of cordiality; it was a very well-structured way to actually hear what the candidates had to say,” said Sarah Van Exan. Many of the questions posed by moderators were very black and white and elicited clear responses, she added. GreenPAC, which organized the first 100 Debates for the Environment in 2019 in partnership with Équiterre, aims to facilitate as many non-partisan all-candidate debates as possible to draw attention to environmental issues. This year's events began on Sept. 7 and will run until Sept. 16 in federal ridings across the country. The debates provide voters with a chance to question local candidates on their plans for climate action, raise public awareness of climate issues, and subsequently pressure politicians to take concrete action, said Boyd Reimer, who attended the Toronto-Danforth event. “Human civilization is at a giant crossroads,” the 61-year-old said. “It's a watershed moment. We either take action away from the status quo or we face a catastrophic situation, which would involve massive human suffering …And I simply could not live with myself if I did not do anything about that.” He said the most powerful moment of the debate was when Green Party candidate Maryem Tollar was overcome with emotion as she recounted her youngest son asking her “if we should start preparing for the apocalypse.” Attendees and candidates broached topics like the link between climate change and local impacts such as worsening food insecurity. Having a space to localize the broad issue of climate change is important, said Van Exan, and these debates offer an opportunity to organize and follow up on important local issues once the election is decided. So far, 62 debates have taken place, and another 10 are expected to occur between Sept. 10 and 16. The debates span eight provinces, and notable candidates like Conservative environment critic Dan Albas, Liberal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, Green Party Leader Annamie Paul, and Liberal Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson are attending GreenPAC events in their ridings. In 2019, over 100 GreenPAC debates took place, but this year, the time pressure of a snap election at the end of summer, the presence of COVID-19, and the timing of religious holidays and the federal leaders’ debates limited organizers’ ability to set up the events. One debate for Port Moody-Coquitlam and Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam had to be cancelled when the two Liberal candidates, Will Davis and Ron McKinnon, withdrew from the event on Tuesday. A Liberal representative cited “unforeseen circumstances” as the reason for their last-minute cancellation. Neither of the Conservative candidates responded to the invitation. Christina Gower, 49, was on the organizing committee along with “a hodgepodge of people trying to fight for the environment,” and said the cancellation was “really sad” but not entirely surprising. “A lot of people put in a lot of work,” said Gower. “I'm very deeply disappointed that the opportunity to hear from our local candidates on the environment was lost.” Despite the challenges, Van Exan said there were many individuals like Gower who stepped up and did their utmost to make these debates happen. “We have to take this as a sign of how deeply Canadians care about making sure they have a good understanding of the climate plans (and environmental commitments) of their candidates,” she said. Though her riding, Victoria, did not have an environment debate this election, NDP environment and climate change critic Laurel Collins said it’s great these conversations are happening in other ridings, and that the 2019 environmental debate in Victoria “was one of the most in-depth and meaningful debates that we had in the last election ... and an important opportunity for citizens to engage on this critical issue.” “The climate crisis is putting everything that we value at risk …And we need members of Parliament (who) are going to act like this is the emergency that it is,” said Collins. GreenPAC is still compiling data on how many candidates from each party attended and the number of viewers who tuned in, but one advantage of hosting the debates online is already revealing itself. In the Ottawa Centre riding, 150 people attended the Zoom debate, but 380 people have watched the Facebook livestream of the event since then for a total of 530 views. “If we're able to get up 72 recordings that people can watch when they have the time to listen thoughtfully and to think about how that affects their vote, that's an important resource for the public … and a resource that really becomes a tool for accountability down the road,” said Van Exan. You can view the debates here as the videos are uploaded over the coming days. The North Okanagan-Shuswap riding debate is scheduled for this evening, and 35-year-old Kristine Wickner said she is looking forward to asking the Liberal candidate about their climate platform. Living in a Conservative stronghold, Wickner said her vote will likely go to the NDP or Green Party because the incremental, market-dependent climate plans of the Liberals and Conservatives are not what she thinks Canadians need. In Reimer’s riding, the Conservative candidate did not participate, and he said anyone with kids shouldn’t be voting Conservative because their children will be left to deal with the inevitable fallout. “I don't even have kids myself,” said Reimer. “But I do have a heart. And I could not live with myself if I allowed the scientific reality of climate change to create a catastrophic situation and create all that human suffering.” Subject: Debates; Climate change; Elections"

"2021-09-13","Full text: Party leaders defend Quebec after debate OTTAWA - Federal party leaders were defending Quebec against charges of racism on Friday — a day too late, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet shot back — as they returned to the road hoping to capitalize on any post-debate momentum as Canadians start voting in advance polls. No stranger to recent federal election campaigns, the controversial issue of secularism in Quebec once again burst onto the scene at Thursday's English-language debate, when Blanchet objected strongly to the phrasing of a question by moderator Shachi Kurl. Kurl asked about Blanchet's support for ""discriminatory"" laws in Quebec such as one known as Bill 21, which bars some civil servants in positions of authority from wearing religious symbols or garb. Blanchet in turn accused her of painting all Quebecers as racist. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Conservative rival Erin O’Toole in separate campaign events on Friday asserted Quebecers are not racist, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said it was unhelpful for the fight against systemic racism to single out any one province or territory. Quebec, with 78 seats, is a key battleground that could determine the outcome of the election. At dissolution, the Liberals held 35 seats in the provinces, the Bloc 32, the Conservatives 10 and the NDP just one. Quebec Premier Francois Legault, for his part, described the question about Bill 21 and Bill 96, which proposes to strengthen the role of French in Quebec, as “unacceptable” and an attack on the province. He called for Kurl and debate organizers to apologize. In statement Friday, the Debate Broadcast Group said Kurl's question about the bills were to give Blanchet a chance to explain his party's view on them. ""The question addressed these bills explicitly; it did not state that Quebecers are racist,"" the statement said. Both Bill 21 and Bill 96 have been panned by civil liberties and human rights groups as discriminatory. Bill 21, which has widespread support in the province, has been challenged in court, though the province has pre-emptively used the notwithstanding clause to protect it from a challenge under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Blanchet defended both laws during the debate as legitimate and reflective of Quebec’s values. He also objected to how the issue of systemic discrimination had become ""a political tool"" to use against Quebec. ""It became a tool to say Quebec is this and that and racist and xenophobic and all of that,” Blanchet said in the debate. The only leader to challenge Blanchet during the debate was Green Party Leader Annamie Paul, who invited the Bloc Québécois leader “to get educated about systemic discrimination.” Trudeau has previously spoken out against Bill 21, including during the 2019 federal election, as well as a ban on face coverings adopted by the Quebec government. That issue also figured prominently in the 2015 election when the former Conservative government mulled a niqab ban for public servants. He reiterated his opposition to the secularism law on Friday. Yet the Liberal leader also said he was “taken aback” by the premise of Kurl’s question, saying during a campaign event in Hamilton.: “It is wrong to suggest that Quebecers are racist. As a Quebecer, I found that question really offensive."
"2021-09-13","Full text: This article has been updated to include the most recent information available. Climate change will almost certainly be top of mind in the upcoming election after a summer of intense heat waves has left apartment dwellers roasting with no relief and wildfires are sweeping through Ontario and B.C.’s rural communities. A recent landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) foresees a grim future with more of the same — and worse — if we don’t act now. An urgent call to action from the International Energy Agency (IEA) mapped out a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, but Canada has yet to meet an emissions reduction goal and the Paris Agreement climate targets may soon move out of reach without immediate and massive greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, according to the IPCC report. Here is where the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP, Green Party and Bloc Québécois stand on climate action. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada’s new GHG reduction target will be 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Whether we will meet this remains unknown, and given the country’s track record, some have doubts. Canada’s emissions jumped 3.3 per cent from 2016 to 2019, according to a report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the Corporate Mapping Project, the Parkland Institute, Stand.earth, West Coast Environmental Law and 350.org. Trudeau’s new target fails to keep pace with the Biden administration’s commitment to a 50 to 52 per cent reduction by 2030. On Sept. 1, the Liberals released their costed election platform, which promises roughly $7.4 billion for climate initiatives over the next five years. Earlier this year, a Supreme Court ruling put an end to legal challenges from the governments of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Ontario that the federal government’s carbon pricing law encroached on provincial autonomy and was unconstitutional. After the release of Erin O’Toole’s climate plan in mid-April, all four major federal parties now support some variation of carbon pricing. After the Supreme Court ruled the implementation of the Liberals’ carbon tax was constitutional, MP Laurel Collins, the NDP critic for environment and climate change, issued a statement saying, “The Liberals have staked their entire climate plan on the carbon tax,” which “isn’t nearly enough.” The statement decries the Liberals’ ongoing support of big polluters and calls for immediate investment in transit, energy-efficient homes and buildings, and clean energy. The NDP’s costed platform is expected to be released Sept. 11. When Trudeau announced Canada’s new target of 40 to 45 per cent emissions reductions, federal Green Party Leader Annamie Paul told Canada’s National Observer those “unambitious targets” will be impossible to meet if the federal government continues to subsidize the fossil fuel industry and greenlight projects like the three offshore drilling projects recently approved off the coast of St. John’s, N.L. The Green Party released its election platform on Sept. 7; it has not been costed. On Aug. 22, the Bloc Québécois released its 2021 platform complete with a pledge to end fossil fuel subsidies, pointing out that under the Liberals, fossil fuel subsidies increased beyond the Stephen Harper era. The platform says money from subsidies would be redirected to clean energies and research centres in Quebec while maintaining funding for Western Canada to transition away from fossil fuels.

"2021-09-13","Full text: Indigenous people got little more than platitudes from the leaders of the five major parties in last night’s one and only English-language federal election debate, and that’s why Assembly of First Nations National Chief RoseAnne Archibald tried to push organizers for an Indigenous-issues only debate. “That would be the space where we could really get a sense of what these leaders are prepared to do, what commitments they can make,” she said. It’s a place where Archibald could hear where leaders and the parties stand on inherent and treaty rights. Archibald watched the debate after coming off the water in Nova Scotia where she boarded a Mi’kmaw fishing boat as the treaty-rights bearing fishers were surrounded by department of Fisheries and Oceans officials. Their lobster traps were seized by DFO. “There’s a real underlying issue (of) … inherent and treaty rights being ignored. First Nations sovereignty and jurisdiction are not being addressed adequately in my view, and I would have liked to have heard the leadership of the parties on how they would begin to create the mechanisms so that we can really have true peace here on Turtle Island because these conflicts … are really about lands and waters and resources,” she said. Dismantling the Indian Act and ensuring that Canada lives up to its constitutional obligations to Indigenous peoples were among the topics pursued by APTN journalist Melissa Ridgen, who led the Reconciliation section of the debate. However, the answers to her questions provided few details beyond parties hoping to build partnerships and their stated need to listen to Indigenous leaders. Liberal leader and incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government was committed to dismantling the Indian Act and how that happened would vary from community to community depending on which jurisdictions each wanted to first tackle. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said the solution would have to be “Indigenous led.” Conservative leader Erin O’Toole said he would work with Indigenous leaders from non-profits, the private sector, industry and academia, while Green Party leader Annamie Paul said Indigenous MPs would provide direction. Archibald points out that none of the answers—whether on this question or others—included getting direction from the AFN, the Métis National Council or the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, which reflects an “ongoing colonial approach, an ongoing patriarchal and paternalistic approach” to solving issues. “I did notice that generally the parties feel they’re consulting with somebody. I don’t know who it is. I certainly was not asked as a national chief to have input into party platforms, where I stood on particular issues (and) that’s a problem because the issues that we’re facing, the longstanding ongoing problems and challenges, the solutions to those issues are actually in First Nations,” said Archibald. Bloc Québécois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet faced a question about systemic racism in Quebec, with specific reference to Atikamekw woman Joyce Echaquan who recorded and posted the racist treatment she received in a hospital just prior to her death. It was the second question of the night that Blanchet had received about discrimination in his home province. He refused to answer. Archibald said she recently did a tour of communities in western and southwestern Quebec with AFN Regional Chief Ghislain Picard. “It’s very clear to me that there is not only systemic racism in Quebec, there’s outright racism and that racism is impacting the rights of First Nations people in that province,” she said. Archibald said the Quebec government had made little progress in resolving land issues on unsurrendered and unceded territories of the Algonquin people, which infringes upon their rights and access to resources. “To me that really speaks to a province, a provincial government, that isn’t doing enough to begin to solve the problems of their province as it relates to First Nations right holders,” she said. All the leaders made it clear that reconciliation was a priority, but few were specific on the issues raised through the questions asked by both Ridgen and debate moderator Shachi Kurl, which included building respectful nation-to-nation relationships with Indigenous peoples; addressing the disproportionate violence faced by Indigenous women and girls; addressing poverty and trauma in order to keep children out of the child welfare system; and ensuring money spent to address Indigenous concerns gets results. The section on reconciliation, which was one of five debate topics for the evening, was kicked off by 18-year-old Ojibway man, Marek McLeod of Sault Ste. Marie, who asked how the leaders would build trust with Indigenous peoples after 150 years of failure. “Relationship,” “partnership,” “engagement” and “action” were the buzzwords for the answers, but nothing specific was offered to follow those words. Paul, the only woman on the debate floor, made it clear “political will” was needed to tackle violence against Indigenous women and girls and to ensure that poverty and trauma were addressed in order to keep children out of the child welfare system. “The Indigenous leadership is there; it is ready to guide all of these processes. We have all of the recommendations we need. What we're missing is political will,” she said. As for the other topics of the night—Affordability, Climate, COVID-19 recovery, and Leadership and Accountability—Archibald says these all pertain to First Nations people as well, although the solutions differ. “That’s where we’ve got to start charting the path forward with all of these parties, is helping them to understand that First Nations people want the same thing that regular Canadians want. We want our children to be healthy and happy, surrounded by the love and care of their families in safe and vibrant communities. We all want that. The solutions of how to get there are actually in our communities,” she said. While the choppy format of the debate did not allow for prolonged discussion among the leaders, Archibald said she was impressed with the work done by Ridgen, who offered up strong, detailed questions. Ridgen is the first Indigenous journalist to ever be included in a federal leadership debate. “I hope by APTN being here, asking the questions that we asked, regardless of what the answers were, I think that the questions should be enough to get people thinking and I hope to see that people get educated,” said Ridgen, speaking after the debate in a special follow-up broadcast by APTN. Prior to the debate, Archibald released the AFN’s The Healing Path Forward: 2021 Federal Election Priorities for First Nations and Canada, which outlined five priorities: truth, reconciliation and healing for First Nations and all Canadians; climate and conservation leadership with First Nations; economic growth, prosperity, and wealth building for First Nations; promoting peace by respecting First Nations jurisdiction; and rebuilding and strengthening First Nations."
"2021-09-13","Full text: Fernandez inspiring to many Canadian newcomers Stephanie Valenzuela confesses she's never been ""a crazy tennis fan,"" watching the sport only occasionally in the past if a tournament sparked her interest. But that casual fandom has grown exponentially since Canada's Leylah Annie Fernandez began her remarkable run at the U.S. Open. Valenzuela, a 30-year-old Filipina-Canadian in Montreal, says she's been enthralled over the last two weeks with the diminutive 19-year-old Fernandez, a Filipina-Ecuadorian from Laval, Que., who has taken down giant after giant to advance to her first Grand Slam final. Fernandez, ranked No. 73 when the major began on Aug. 30, beat No. 2 seed Aryna Sabalenka on Thursday night to reach Saturday's final against British teen Emma Raducanu. She also beat four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka, former world No. 1 Angelique Kerber, and No. 5 seed Elina Svitolina over the last week, gaining new supporters with each stunning victory. Valenzuela and friends included. ""Even if you're not interested in the sport, you get into it, just out of the pride of seeing somebody from your cultural background, from your country of origin,"" says Valenzuela, a Montreal native born to Filipino parents who immigrated to Canada in the 1980s. ""To see where she's at, it just proves there is a place for us here. … Filipino-Canadians have just as much of an opportunity as anyone else in Canada."" Fernandez was born to a Filipina-Canadian mother and Ecuadorian father, who also serves as her coach. The family moved years ago to Florida, where Fernandez and her younger sister Bianca now train. Valenzuela says she's been captivated by not only Fernandez's playing style and fearlessness in the face of her toughest opponents, but also her family's story. Fernandez's father Jorge wiped away tears during a video interview with TSN this week when talking about Canada welcoming his immigrant family. He added he wouldn't have been able to give his daughters the lives they have without that welcome. Valenzuela, who's a candidate for Montreal's city council elections this November, says that message resonated with her. ""It's amazing to hear her father (talk about) her roots, her heritage as a Canadian, as an Ecuadorian, as a Filipina,"" Valenzuela says. ""And it really just shows that regardless of your background, if you work really hard and you have the support, you can get there."" Fernandez is one of many young Canadian tennis stars to have immediate roots in other countries. Bianca Andreescu, the 2019 U.S. Open champion, was born in Romania before moving to Canada at a young age while former world No. 3 Milos Raonic is originally from Montenegro. Denis Shapovalov's mother is an Israeli-Ukrainian tennis coach and former player, and Felix Auger-Aliassime, the 21-year-old Montrealer playing in Friday's men's semifinal, is the son of a French-Canadian mother and Togo-born father. Diego Stacey-Moreno, Ecuador's ambassador to Canada, says having so many cultures represented among Canadian players enhances the game here. ""It's important that these new generations don't forget their roots, that they keep their cultural traditions in order to enrich new traditions,"" he says in a phone interview from Ottawa. ""(Fernandez) is a mixture of diversity that shows the world a human being should be taken with all their feelings, all their heritage."" Tennis Canada says they'll host a viewing party in Montreal for Saturday's match, with COVID safety measures in place. The Filipino Association of Montreal and Suburbs says community members regularly gather at their centre on weekends: ""and we will not miss the finals, of course."""

In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and sailed into the Pacific Ocean. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg was signed, officially dividing Europe into the Roman Catholic church and the new Lutheran, or Protestant, church. Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, conceded lands to Protestantism to end the religious divisions in the empire. In 1670, Dutch inventor Jan Van Der Hieda first demonstrated a fire engine using a water hose. In 1690, ""Publick Occurrences,"" the first American newspaper, published its first -- and last -- edition in Boston.

In 1991, Stan Waters -- Canada's first ""elected"" senator -- died of brain cancer. His victory in Alberta's 1989 election for a Senate nominee injected life into the debate over Senate reform. Waters, a member of the Reform Party, was appointed to the Upper Chamber by prime minister Brian Mulroney. In 1991, Klaus Barbie, known as the ""Butcher of Lyon,"" died in a French prison hospital at age 77. The former Nazi Gestapo chief was serving a life sentence. In 1992, the U.S. launched an unmanned spacecraft bound for Mars, the first flight of its kind in 17 years. In 1998, Frenchman Benoit Lecomte became the first person to swim the Atlantic Ocean. He had set off from Cape Cod, Mass., and reached the coast of Brittany after 72 days.

In 2008, a 20-year-old man was convicted in a Brampton, Ont., courthouse of conspiring in a group plot to bomb several Canadian targets, including Parliament Hill, RCMP headquarters and nuclear power plants. The accused, who was 17 when he committed his alleged offences, became the first person in Canada to be convicted under the Anti-terrorism Act passed by Ottawa in 2001. In 2008, Seattle-based Washington Mutual Inc., (founded in 1889), with $307 billion in assets, became the largest bank to collapse in U.S. history under the weight of its enormous bad bets on the mortgage market. In 2016, golfing icon Arnold Palmer, who brought a country club sport to the masses with a hard-charging style, charisma and a commoner's touch, died at age 87. ""The King"" joined the PGA Tour in 1955 and won the Canadian Open for the first of his 62 titles. He went on to win seven majors. In 2018, the prosecution withdrew an assault charge in Toronto against former star Blue Jays pitcher Roberto Osuna in exchange for a one-year agreement that he stay away from the mother of his child and continue counselling. The Crown said the complainant, Alejandra Roman Cota, had made it clear she would not return to Toronto to testify against Osuna. In 2018, Pope Francis acknowledged that the sex abuse scandals surrounding the Catholic Church had outraged the faithful and said the church must change its ways if it wanted to keep future generations. The statement followed the release of a report that concluded at least 3,677 people were abused by clergy between 1946 and 2014. In 2018, The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said an Air Canada pilot had been awake for over 19 hours when his plane had a near miss at San Francisco International Airport late on the night of July 7, 2017. The plane mistakenly lined up to land on a taxiway that had four other planes on it at the time and cleared the first jet by only 30 metres when it initiated a go-around and started climbing. In 2020, some pharmacies across Ontario started offering appointment-only COVID-19 tests. Tougher COVID-19 restrictions were also reimposed in Winnipeg and in Ontario due to a spike in cases. In Ontario, Premier Doug Ford said bars and restaurants would have to stop serving booze at 11 p.m. — and strip clubs must close entirely. In 2020, the minority Liberal government made a deal with the NDP that averted a non-confidence vote — and a fall election. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Bans; Parliamentary reform; Age; Professional baseball; Mormonism; Criminal sentences; Political appointments; Professional basketball; Professional golf; Coronaviruses; Nuclear power plants; COVID-19"
"2021-09-12","Full text: Today in History - Sept. 24 Today in History for Sept. 24: On this date: In 787, the Second Nicene Council opened under Pope Hadrian I. Numbered by some as the seventh of the church’s 21 ecumenical councils, Nicea II condemned iconoclasm, the belief that the veneration of Christian images and relics is idolatry. In 1621, the first news-sheet in English was printed in England. It had no name, but is considered the beginning of English journalism. In 1780, Benedict Arnold escaped one day after his treason was disclosed. Arnold, a major-general and commander of the American fort West Point, had planned to surrender the fort to the British. He became a colonel in the British army and later lived in Saint John, N.B., where he engaged in business for four years. He then returned to England, where he died in 1801. In 1788, Canada made its first shipment of furs to China. In 1869, the Black Friday panic hit Wall Street after an attempt by financiers Jay Gould and James Fisk to corner the gold market. Gold prices tumbled when the U.S. Treasury announced it would sell $4 million in gold. In 1870, Georges Claude, an engineer who devised a process for liquefying air, was born in Paris. In 1872, the Chess Federation of Canada, the highest-ranking chess organization in the country, was founded in Hamilton. In 1889, in The Netherlands, the ""Declaration of Utrecht"" was signed and became the doctrinal basis of the Old Catholic Church. Old Catholics reject clerical celibacy, papal authority and the Council of Trent decisions. Today in Europe, Old Catholics are active in the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. In 1896, F. Scott Fitzgerald, the American novelist famous for his depictions of the Jazz Age, was born in St. Paul, Minn. He wrote his first novel, ""This Side of Paradise,"" at the age of 24. His most famous book, ""The Great Gatsby,"" is considered one of the great examples of American literature. Fitzgerald died in 1940 in the midst of writing a novel about Hollywood that was to be his comeback from personal problems caused by financial setbacks and his wife's insanity. In 1904, Toronto's George Lyon won the golf title at the St. Louis Olympics. The 46-year-old eccentric walked to the award ceremony on his hands. It was the last time golf was an Olympic sport before being reinstated for the 2016 Olympics, won by Britain's Justin Rose. In 1912, Sir Richard John Cartwright, Canada's first Liberal finance minister, died in Kingston, Ont., at age 76. He came from a rich and powerful family. A loyalist, he was educated at Trinity College in Dublin, but he did not take a degree from the prestigious school. Backed by his family, he went into business. He entered politics in 1863 and went on to represent various constituencies in Ontario. Cartwright split from Sir John A. Macdonald's Conservative party in 1869, sitting as an Independent until 1873, when he joined the Liberals. He became a powerful member of the party and cabinet and strongly pushed for a free trade deal with the United States. He was finance minister from 1873-78 and minister of trade and commerce from 1896-1911. In 1934, Babe Ruth made his farewell appearance as a regular player with the New York Yankees in a game against the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox won 5-0. In 1950, a Canadian military mission arrived in Tokyo to become the first Canadian unit dispatched in the Korean conflict. In 1952, six boxes of gold bullion worth $215,000 were stolen from an unguarded building at the Toronto airport. The gold, awaiting shipment to Montreal, was never found but it was believed to have eventually been smuggled to Hong Kong and China. In 1956, Canada, Britain and the United States signed an atomic energy agreement in Washington. In 1957, the Brooklyn Dodgers played their last home game at Ebbets Field in New York, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates 2-0. The Dodgers moved to Los Angeles at the start of the 1958 season, becoming the first West Coast baseball team. In 1959, four years after quitting the NDP, Ross Thatcher was elected leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal party. He later became premier. In 1960, the ""USS Enterprise,"" the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was launched. In 1962, the ""Garden of the Provinces"" in Ottawa was opened by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. In 1970, ""Luna 16"" returned to the Soviet Union, ending the first unmanned trip to the moon. In 1971, the British government expelled 90 officials from the Soviet Embassy and refused entry to 15 others. A former member of the KGB defected to Britain and implicated the expelled officials in espionage. In 1975, the U.S. Senate intelligence committee announced the CIA had been opening foreign letters addressed to Americans for 20 years. In 1976, newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst was sentenced to seven years in prison for her part in a 1974 bank robbery. She was released after 22 months under an executive clemency order from U.S. President Jimmy Carter. In 1984, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip began a 14-day Canadian tour. In 1988, Canadian Ben Johnson set a world record in the 100-metre sprint at the Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. Johnson clocked 9.79 seconds and won the much-anticipated showdown against his arch-rival American Carl Lewis. But Johnson's glory was short-lived. Several days later, he was stripped of his gold medal -- which went to Lewis -- after testing positive for banned anabolic steroids. The scandal led to the Dubin commission, a federal inquiry into drug use in amateur sport. (Jamaica’s Usain Bolt lowered his own 100-metre record with a 9.58 at the 2009 world championships in Berlin.) In 1991, Theodore Geisel, who wrote under the pen name ""Dr. Seuss,"" died at age 87. In 1993, Prince Norodom Sihanouk reclaimed the Cambodian throne he abdicated four decades earlier and was sworn in as king. He also signed into law a new constitution officially proclaiming war-ravaged Cambodia a democratic and constitutional monarchy. In 1993, in a speech to the United Nations, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela called for a lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa. Canada, the United States and Commonwealth nations subsequently removed all trade, investment and financial embargoes against the country. In 1996, Justice Jean Bienvenue resigned from the Quebec Superior Court, avoiding the possibility of becoming the first federally appointed judge in Canadian history to be fired. Bienvenue had raised a storm of controversy when he said during a murder trial that women can be crueller than men and ""the Nazis did not eliminate millions of Jews in a painful and bloody manner. They died in the gas chamber without suffering."" In 1998, South African president Nelson Mandela became the first foreign leader to receive the Order of Canada as he was invested as an Honorary Companion of the order. He was cited as being a universal symbol of triumph over oppression, and a towering figure in the transition from apartheid to democracy in South Africa, emerging as one of this century's greatest statesmen and humanitarians. In 1999, in a deal with Britain, Iran publicly disassociated itself from a bounty offered for author Salman Rushdie’s murder by the edict of the late Ayatollah Khomeini. In 1999, India announced its intention to sign the global nuclear test-ban treaty one day after its arch-rival Pakistan made the same pledge. In 2002, the UN Security Council voted 14-0 to call on Israel to withdraw from Palestinian territories. The United States abstained from the vote. In 2002, gunmen burst into a Hindu temple in western Gujarat, India, and opened fire, killing at least 29 people. In 2004, Nova Scotia became the sixth province or territory in Canada to allow same-sex marriages when the province’s Supreme Court ruled that banning such unions was unconstitutional. In 2005, the IMF approved a deal to forgive more than US$40 billion in debt for the world’s poorest countries. In 2007, Parti Quebecois Leader Pauline Marois won a byelection in the Charlevoix riding of Quebec, securing a seat in the National Assembly to become the first woman to lead a major political party in Quebec. (In 2012, she became the first female premier of the province. She resigned as PQ leader after losing her riding in the 2014 election and the Liberals securing a majority government.) In 2009, Repsol and Irving Oil officially opened their controversial liquefied natural gas terminal in Saint John, N.B. The $1-billion terminal was the first to be built in Canada and the first land-based LNG-receiving and re-gas terminal built on the East Coast of North America in 30 years. In 2009, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a landmark resolution calling on states with nuclear weapons to rid themselves of their deadly stockpiles. In 2013, a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck in the remote district of Awaran in Pakistan's Baluchistan province, killing over 800 people. The earth moved with enough force to create a small island visible off the southern coast. In 2015, a stampede and crush of people in Mina during the annual Hajj pilgrimage killed more than 2,400 pilgrims, according to an Associated Press count based on figures reported by various hajj ministries and governments. (The official Saudi government toll of 769 people killed and 934 injured has not changed.) In 2015, Pope Francis became the first pontiff to speak to a joint session of U.S. Congress. In 2017, Germany's election produced an awkward result that left Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc seeking a coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and the traditionally left-leaning Greens. Weeks of talks on forming a new majority government collapsed, leaving a minority government, not previously tried in post-war Germany, or new elections as the only options. In 2018, a Toronto man who stood to inherit a multi-million-dollar aviation company was found guilty of first-degree murder in his father's death. It was Dellen Millard's third such conviction after he was earlier found guilty of killing his ex-girlfriend and a Hamilton man trying to sell his truck. In 2018, the Trudeau government ordered officials to take a second look at any case where funding or services for veterans' family members are not related to the veterans' service. The move followed widespread anger after Veterans Affairs decided to pay for the PTSD treatment of a Halifax man convicted of killing an off-duty police officer because his father was a veteran who had also been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2018, New Brunswick ended up in uncertain political waters following a provincial election that reduced the governing Liberals to 21 seats - one less than the Progressive Conservatives - while the Green Party and the People's Alliance won three ridings each. In 2019, a Federal Court judge granted the British Columbia government a temporary injunction against an Alberta law that could have limited oil exports to other provinces. Justice Sebastien Grammond said Alberta's so-called turn-off-the-tap legislation raised a serious issue and could have caused irreparable harm to the residents of B.C. He said B.C. met the test for blocking the law until the courts could decide its validity. In 2019, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yielded to mounting pressure from fellow Democrats and launched a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Pelosi said the president's alleged actions would mark a ""betrayal of his oath of office.'' It was reported that over the summer, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400-million in military aid for Ukraine days before a phone call with Ukraine's president. During that call, Trump asked Ukraine to investigate former U.S. vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump responded by assailing Democrats with a cascade of furious tweets, and predicted the matter would be a political plus for him. In 2019, Britain's Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the lead-up to the October 31st Brexit deadline was illegal. The historic move backed Parliament's sovereignty and slapped down what justices viewed as an effort by Johnson that essentially squelched debate on the most divisive political issue the country had faced in years. The prime minister hurried back to London after cutting short a trip to the U.N. General Assembly amid demands for his resignation from furious opposition parties. Johnson brushed aside questions about whether he would resign, said he ""strongly"" disagreed with the court decision and suggested he might try to suspend Parliament for a second time. In 2020, China, Russia and the U.S. accused each other of mishandling and politicizing the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials traded allegations about who was responsible for the global pandemic in one of the few real-time exchanges among top officials at a virtual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. The arguments followed earlier criticism from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the lack of international co-operation in tackling the ""out-of-control"" virus. --- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Olympic games; Councils; Earthquakes"
"2021-09-12","Full text: Vancouver Island is a long way from the seat of power in Ottawa, but it's a vital battleground this election for the survival of the federal Green Party. The party’s only two incumbent candidates, former leader Elizabeth May and Paul Manly, are hoping to retain their toehold on the southeast tip of the island, despite bitter infighting between the party’s leader, Annamie Paul, and some of the party’s brass that dragged on until the eve of the election. Election observers suggest May’s Saanich-Gulf Islands riding is in the bag, given she has handily won the Greens’ historic first seat three times since securing it in 2011. However, pundits predict it will be an uphill struggle for Manly, who won the Greens’ second seat in Nanaimo-Ladysmith in a byelection in May 2019. Manly secured it again six months later in the federal election with a healthy margin of 5,000 votes over his nearest Conservative competitor. Regardless, Manly’s campaign is most likely being hobbled by infighting and acrimony between the party’s executive and Paul, who succeeded May in October 2020, said Kim Speers, a political scientist at the University of Victoria. Paul escaped facing a non-confidence vote in July. And the month prior, Fredericton MP Jenica Atwin crossed the floor to the Liberals following party disputes over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — taking the Greens’ third seat and the only one outside B.C. along with her. The internal squabbling so close to the election doesn’t build voter confidence in the party, Speers said. “People aren't really sure what the Green Party is going to look like after the election,” Speers said Wednesday, noting polls put the party at an all-time low and trailing the People’s Party of Canada. “So, I can understand why there might be some hesitancy around voting for the Greens right now.” But Manly is undeterred, insisting what’s happening federally is not being reflected on the ground in the riding, and voters will look at his record independent of the party’s woes. The former filmmaker and communications specialist says his campaign had a strong start out the door, and momentum is good given he’s a well-known entity in the riding who has successfully advocated across party lines around issues local voters care about. “I have lots of support from progressive voters because it’s not just about climate change in this riding,” Manly said, noting he has championed affordable housing, changes to seniors’ long-term care, universal dental and pharmacare, and guaranteed livable income. “People see that I'm leading the discourse in the House of Commons on a lot of these things,” he said, adding the party has a newly elected federal council, and he wasn’t embroiled in the conflict. Regardless of Manly’s record, Speers doubts his campaign can overcome the Green Party’s struggles. “It doesn’t matter how good an MP is, he’s just been affected by those external variables that are kind of beyond his control and that happen in elections all the time,” Speers said. While Vancouver Island has been a hot spot of Green support, much of that depended on May’s popularity as leader, she said. May squashed the competition in 2019, winning 49 per cent of the vote, more than doubling the ballots of her nearest Conservative competitor David Busch, who secured 20 per cent and is running again this election. But May’s mantle of popularity probably won’t benefit Manly — who also can’t count on a bump from Paul given the leader hasn’t left her Toronto Centre riding area to campaign nationally and isn’t likely to, Speers said. “With the new leader not travelling across Canada, not visiting Vancouver Island which has really strong Green support, I don't think that's helped the Green Party's overall level of support.” Paul is unlikely to win her seat, or survive the leadership review slated for the fall, which signals further turmoil for the party, Speers added. Leadership transitions can be bumpy, Manly said, pointing to NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh’s popularity struggle before he won his Burnaby riding in a byelection in 2019 nearly 18 months after becoming party leader. Now, in terms of leader favourability, Singh is leading the polls, if not in voter intention. The NDP is likely the Greens’ biggest competitor for the progressive vote on Vancouver Island, and school board trustee Lisa Marie Barron is the party’s candidate for Nanaimo-Ladysmith. But there’s the possibility the federal NDP may pay a price for the perceived sins of its provincial counterparts, said Kathryn Harrison, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia. Old-growth logging, forestry policy, and the contentious Fairy Creek blockades are hot-button issues with environmentally conscious voters across B.C., but particularly on Vancouver Island. “What can happen in federal elections is that people's frustration with a provincial government can spill over into the vote,” Harrison said. “And one of the challenges I suspect for Jagmeet Singh is that there are a lot of Green voters who are unhappy with the John Horgan government right now.” Manly agreed, saying voter displeasure with the NDP includes the federal party’s unwillingness to disavow the B.C. government’s Coastal GasLink project to pipe natural gas to the LNG Canada terminus on the north coast. “(The NDP) rail against the Trans Mountain pipeline, but I can’t even get Jagmeet Singh to say a word in the House of Commons when I ask him if he’ll support a ban on fracking,” Manly said. Despite the NDP taking every other riding on Vancouver Island save those won by the Greens in the last election, the Conservatives — represented this election by Tamara Kronis — proved to be the closest competition for the Greens in Nanaimo-Ladysmith in the last vote. Manly won 35 per cent of the vote in 2019, beating the Tories’ 26 per cent, the NDP's 24 per cent, and the Liberals’ 14 per cent. Manly’s first foray into federal politics under the Green banner in 2015 resulted in a tight four-way race where he took 20 per cent of the vote for the Greens, and then boosted that by 15 percentage points to win the riding in the next election. The Conservatives’ performance in the riding has remained more or less steady the last two elections at about 25 per cent of the vote. Manly said while he’s confident about his chances of re-election, he’s not taking any chances and is making every effort to regain his seat. “I’ve worked hard before I was an elected official,” he said. “And as MP, I worked hard for the community and will always work hard. “I take nothing for granted.” Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer None Subject: Leadership; Elections; Competition"
"2021-09-12","Full text: HURON-BRUCE – Four federal Huron-Bruce candidates squared off on the topic of agriculture, in last week’s all-candidates meeting hosted by the Huron and Bruce federations of agriculture. Participants in the Sept. 2 event were Ben Lobb, Conservative; James Rice, Liberal; Jan Johnstone, NDP; and Justin Smith, Independent. Jack Stecho, People’s Party, sent his regrets. The order of speaking was decided ahead of time, and changed throughout the meeting, to ensure no candidate had an unfair advantage or disadvantage. Moderators were Rob Vanden Hengel, Huron County Federation of Agriculture, and Chris Cossitt, Bruce County Federation of Agriculture. Each candidate was given the opportunity to give an opening and closing statement, and an answer to each question. Questions were also decided in advance. They covered a wide range of topics, all with an agricultural focus, including rural infrastructure such as roads, environmental issues, supply management, education, temporary foreign workers, the carbon tax, foreign trade, keeping farm land in agriculture and the federal budget. Lobb said a Conservative government would invest in rural infrastructure including high-speed internet and community centres, open new markets, demand fair treatment in existing trade deals and address the shortage of agricultural workers. Among the key points he made during the question period was the fact that farmers shouldn’t be regarded as part of the problem in global climate change, but part of the solution. Lobb said a balanced budget is important, and the way to get the economy back on track is to get people working. He described Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole’s million job strategy. Lobb repeatedly made note of the fact Canada is short 30,000 workers in agricultural processing. “We need to keep businesses open, keep the economy open,” he said. Education has a strong role to play in the future of agriculture. “Young people don’t know all the amazing jobs there are in agriculture,” Lobb said. Lobb said he supports Ontario’s Risk Management system as a model to mitigate risk. Rice stressed the importance of agricultural issues in Huron-Bruce and how he’s been reaching out to agricultural stakeholders to find out what’s needed. He said this is one of the most important elections in history, particularly for agriculture. Among the key points he made was the importance of the Liberal Party’s $10 a day daycare program, to get people back into the workforce. Regarding the need for protecting farmland, Rice said the key is encouraging urban centres “to build vertically, not horizontally.” Environmental issues are important to Rice, who pointed out the carbon tax isn’t the only thing in the Liberals’ environmental plan. He spoke of clean energy, something important in Huron-Bruce, where Bruce Power is located. Regarding climate change, Rice said, “Farmers are at the forefront … listen to them!” They know what’s needed, he added. He spoke of being ready to provide strong representation in Ottawa, and said farmers can count on the Liberals to provide relief programs when they’re needed. Johnstone promised to bring to Ottawa the same zeal in representing Huron-Bruce that she has demonstrated in public education. The NDP has bold, new universal programs that would make life more affordable for everyone, she said. Getting people back to work safely is key, she said, and that includes in agriculture. Small business owners including farmers need to be provided with the resources to do that. The importance of temporary foreign workers in agriculture became apparent during the pandemic, she said, adding that residency should be on the table “for the workers who came to Canada to work in agriculture during the pandemic.” She also advocated more employment opportunities for women in agriculture. She answered a question about climate change by saying the NDP is calling for a national soil health strategy, and encourages best management practices. Overall, the NDP is about fairness, she said – taxing the ultra-rich and closing tax loopholes. Smith said that as an independent, he believes in freedom. To him that means lower taxes, an end to corporate bailouts and more money in farmers’ pockets. He asked people to tell him what they want, and he will fight for it. He said he supports ending all COVID-19 subsidies and mandates, to get things “back to the way they’re supposed to be.” He’d end the carbon tax. Having temporary foreign workers in agriculture is a short-term solution to the labour shortage, he said, adding, “We have to make it permanent.” “Eliminating wasteful government programs,” is the way Smith would deal with the deficit. In summary, he said Canadians have been voting for the “lesser evil” for too long; as an independent, he doesn’t have to “toe the party line and can truly represent his constituency.” As the incumbent who has participated in previous federation of agriculture all-candidates meetings, one might have expected Lobb to have the clearest picture of how his party would support agriculture in Huron-Bruce, and he certainly did. However, contenders Rice, Johnstone and Smith made some important points. Rice has made it a priority to engage with the agricultural community, and as someone deeply involved in education and community work, Johnstone demonstrated a firm grasp on area issues.

"2021-09-12","Full text: Today in History - Sept. 20 Today in History for Sept. 20: On this date: In 1378, the ""Great Schism"" in the Roman Catholic Church began. It was touched off when Pope Gregory XI died, shortly after returning the papal seat from Avignon, in France, to Rome. Continuing for nearly 40 years, until 1417, the schism at one point produced three concurrent popes. In 1519, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan began his voyage to circumnavigate the globe. Magellan was killed en route, but one of his ships eventually circled the world. In 1697, the ""Treaty of Ryswick"" was signed. France returned Hudson Bay and Newfoundland to Britain, in return for Acadia. In 1816, stage coach service started between Toronto and Niagara. In 1842, chemist and physicist James Dewar was born in Scotland. In 1892, he invented a double-walled glass vessel to keep gases and chemicals cold. One of his ex-students, Reinhold Burger, patented and began making the ""Thermos"" vacuum flask for domestic use in 1904. In 1857, Delhi, India, fell to the British after a long siege. In 1867, the first general election in Canada, won by the Conservatives under Sir John A. Macdonald, was completed. Confederation, achieved earlier in the year, had set out the mandate for the formation of a federal government to unite the four provinces in the Dominion at the time. Macdonald formed a coalition cabinet almost equally split between Liberal and Conservative ministers and representing different regions, religions and cultures. In 1870, Italian troops took control of the Papal States, leading to the unification of Italy. In 1873, the New York Stock Exchange was forced to close for the first time because of a banking crisis. In 1917, the Wartime Elections Act was passed, giving the vote to some Canadian women and disenfranchising many citizens born in enemy countries. The act gave wives, mothers and sisters of men in the armed service the right to vote. In May 1918, all women gained the vote. In 1917, the ""Income Tax War Act"" was enacted as a temporary measure to raise funds for Canada's troops during the First World War.

WADA said the reinstatement was subject to strict conditions but the head of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport said the agency was effectively thumbing its nose at clean athletes. In 2018, The Canadian Armed Forces said it was re-opening nearly two-dozen cases of alleged sexual assault after reviewing dozens of files previously dismissed by military police as ""unfounded."" The move came nearly 18 months after authorities revealed that nearly one in every three sexual assault complaints logged with military police between 2010 and 2016 was deemed unfounded.

He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy."" In 1911, the federal Conservatives under Robert Borden ousted Sir Wilfrid Laurier's Liberals in a hotly contested election, winning 133 of 221 seats.

The Jays went on to beat Philadelphia in the World Series, also in six games. In 1995, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the federal law that banned tobacco advertising, arguing the law went too far and violated the industry's constitutional right to free speech. Two years later, in 1997, the federal government passed a new law which stopped most tobacco advertising and denied companies the right to sponsor sporting and cultural events. In August, 2005, the Quebec Court of Appeal struck down the part of the law which prohibits tobacco companies from using their corporate names to sponsor events. In 1995, the Canadian government announced the design for a new $2 coin. (It went into circulation on Feb. 19, 1996.)

Rex Humbard, whose televangelism ministry once spanned the globe, died in Atlantis, Fla., at age 88. In 2010, hurricane Igor ripped across eastern Newfoundland with a savagery that forced flooded, wind-battered towns to declare states of emergency, isolating some communities as rivers overflowed and washed away roads. It dumped nearly 240 mm of rain in some areas and caused over $150 million in total damages. Military personnel and equipment arrived on Sept. 25 and spent 10 days helping Newfoundlanders rebuild. In 2013, 61 civilians, including two Canadians, were killed in a raid on Nairobi's Westgate Mall by the Somali-based, al-Qaida-linked group al-Shabab.

In 2018, the Federal cabinet gave the National Energy Board 22 weeks to redo its environmental review of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, this time taking into account the impact of additional oil tanker traffic off the coast of British Columbia. The lack of such an assessment was one of the reasons cited by the Federal Court of Appeal when it overturned approval of the expansion project in August. In 2019, Sid Haig, the bearded character actor best known as Captain Spaulding in the ""House of 1000 Corpses"" trilogy, died. Haig's representative said he had recently fallen in his home. He was 80. The actor's other credits ranged from George Lucas' ""T-H-X 1138'' to the Quentin Tarantino movies ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2.""

"2021-09-12","Full text: This is the fourth of five profiles of candidates for the Kootenay-Columbia riding. A familiar face is looking to turn back time on Sept. 20. Former Kootenay-Columbia MP Wayne Stetski is looking to repeat his 2015 win when he took the riding on the NDP ticket, adding his name to the 2021 list of candidates. Although he lost in the last federal election in 2019 to now incumbent Rob Morrison, Stetski looks to challenge him for the seat based on a platform that puts employment first. “In every corner of the country, families are worried about jobs, the health of our loved ones, and the public services that everyone counts on,” he said through his website (https://www.kootenaycolumbiandp.ca/get-involved). “The past 18 months have shown that Canadians can confront any challenge — when we have to, when we choose to, and when we come together. It’s also shown us that … many of the supports that we rely on just aren’t there when we need them. If we want different results, we need to make different choices.” Stetski has spent his entire life in public service. A former mayor of Cranbrook and Kootenay regional manager for the B.C. Ministry of Environment, Stetski brought a collaborative approach to city hall. As a director on the Regional District of East Kootenay board of directors he represented the region on the Columbia River Treaty Local Government Committee and the Ktunaxa Kinbasket Treaty Advisory Committee. Stetski’s professional life has focused on environmental leadership through a variety of positions, including his role as manager of the East Kootenay Conservation Program following his retirement from the B.C. government. While working for the ministry, Stetski oversaw the Environmental Stewardship Division for the East and West Kootenays, responsible for Fish and Wildlife, B.C. Parks, and Ecosystems, managing a multi-million dollar budget and a large staff with offices in Cranbrook, Nelson, Revelstoke and Invermere. He co-chaired the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program and was the provincial authority member overseeing the management of the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area. Stetski and his wife Audrey have lived in Cranbrook for over 30 years and he has given back to his community in many positions including chair of the Cranbrook/Kimberley United Way, chair of the College of the Rockies Math and Science Advisory Committee, and as coach/manager with Cranbrook Minor Hockey and Cranbrook Minor Ball.

"2021-09-12","Full text: Today in History - Sept. 10 Today in History for Sept. 10: In 1224, the Franciscans, founded in 1209 by St. Francis of Assisi, arrived in England. They were originally called Grey Friars because of their grey habits. The habit worn by modern Franciscans is brown. In 1813, the ""Battle of Lake Erie,"" a War of 1812 engagement, was won when a U.S. naval force under Commodore Oliver Perry defeated the British. The victory, which Perry summed up in a report by saying, ""We have met the enemy and they are ours,"" gave the United States control of Lake Erie. In 1814, the ""St. Lawrence,"" the largest warship built on either side during the War of 1812, was launched at Kingston, Ont. The three-decker carried 112 guns and 1,000 men.

In 1937, more than 1,500 cases of infantile paralysis -- polio -- with 58 deaths were reported in Canada in an epidemic that began in June. In 1939, Canada declared war on Germany. Originally it was thought that Canada's role would be to supply war materiel to Britain, which had declared war seven days earlier, and Prime Minister Mackenzie King took a stand against conscription. But by 1940, 500,000 Canadians had enlisted and when Japan entered the war a year later, King held a plebiscite which allowed him to begin the draft. In total, almost 42,000 Canadian service personnel died in the Second World War. In 1945, Norwegian premier Vidkun Quisling was sentenced to death for collaborating with the Nazis. In 1955, ""Gunsmoke"" premiered on CBS television. It ran for nearly 20 years until March 31, 1975. It was the second-longest fictional prime-time program in U.S. history. (The Simpsons is first). In 1960, Halifax International Airport was opened. In 1976, a British Airways jet collided in mid-flight with an Adria Airlines DC-9 over Zagreb, Yugoslavia, due to an error by air traffic control.

In 1989, Hungary granted permission to thousands of East German refugees to cross into Austria despite protests from East German authorities. It helped precipitate the fall of the Berlin Wall two months later and the end of Communist rule throughout Eastern Europe. In 1999, ""HMCS Huron"" nabbed a ship carrying 150 to 170 Chinese illegal immigrants in Nootka Sound, off the west coast of Vancouver Island. It was the fourth such capture in less than two months, increasing the total number of Chinese boat people that summer to more than 600. In 2000, Tiger Woods won the Canadian Open golf championship at Glen Abbey golf course in Oakville, Ont. He became the second golfer (Lee Trevino in 1971) to win the U.S. Open, the British Open and the Canadian Open in the same year. In 2000, Ben Wicks, British-born Canadian cartoonist, died at age 73. In 2000, ""Cats"" was performed for the last time on Broadway, after an 18-year run. In 2001, the federal Conservative Party and eight dissident Canadian Alliance MPs formed an unprecedented joint parliamentary unit -- the Progressive Conservative Democratic Representative Coalition.

In 2010, BCE announced it was buying the rest of the CTV television network it didn't already own for $1.3 billion. The deal also saw a majority stake in the Globe and Mail pass to the Thomson family, though BCE held on to a 15 per cent stake. In 2011, an estimated 100,000 people, including Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, attended a memorial ceremony at the Lokomotiv ice arena honouring the 36 players, coaches and staff of the Russian team that perished in a plane crash on Sept. 7. (Alexander Galimov, the lone player who survived the initial impact, died on Sept. 12.) In 2013, the minority Quebec government released its proposals for a ""values charter"" aimed at restricting religious clothing and symbols worn by employees at all government institutions. The proposals set off a storm of controversy. (The bill died after the Parti Quebecois lost the April 2014 election to the Liberal Party.) In 2013, a court in India convicted four men of the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus, an attack that set off waves of protests and gave voice to years of anger over the treatment of women. They were sentenced to hang but the Supreme Court stayed their executions pending appeals. (There were two other suspects - one was found dead in his cell in an apparent suicide while the other was convicted in juvenile court and sentenced to three years in a reform home.) In 2016, Angelique Kerber won her first U.S. Open title and second career major, defeating Karolina Pliskova 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.

In 2018, Peter Donat, the Canadian actor who played Agent Fox Mulder's father in ""The X-Files"" and had roles in TV shows, films and on stage, died at his home in California. He was 90. In 2019, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson formally suspended Parliament and sent rebellious lawmakers home until two weeks before the country was supposed to exit the European Union on Oct. 31. Lawmakers used the hours before the suspension to deliver new blows to Johnson's authority. An opposition-backed measure designed to stop Britain from leaving the E.U. without a deal became law after receiving the formal assent of Queen Elizabeth II. That came hours before legislators rejected Johnson's demand for a snap election to break the political deadlock engulfing the government. Speaker John Bercow, whose control of business in the House of Commons made him a central player in the Brexit drama, announced he would step down after a decade in the job. In 2020, Canada's election watchdog said former finance minister Bill Morneau broke the law when he promoted Liberal candidates at government-funded events he attended as finance minister. Commissioner Yves Cote said Morneau broke a section of the Elections Act that prohibits anyone but individuals from donating to political parties. One candidate who appeared with Morneau at multiple events in 2019, Anita Anand, went on to become the federal procurement minister. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: State elections; Professional golf; EU membership; Prime ministers"

Paul was speaking in a post-debate press conference after Blanchet levelled criticism against debate moderator, Shachi Kurl, for unfairly criticizing Quebec in how she framed questions. --- 12:01 a.m. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he would co-operate with other parties in a minority government for the good of all Canadians. Singh was responding to a report that Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet would rule out propping up a Liberal or Conservative minority government for any length of time in the House of Commons. In a post-debate news conference, Singh rejected suggestions that his climate change plan is too vague, saying his plan will take bold steps to tackle the problem. He was also forced on the defensive with questions about why he put forth a platform that is not fully costed for Canadian voters to evaluate. --- 11:50 p.m. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said a distinction has to be made between ""mobs"" of anti-vaxxers who have dogged his campaign and Canadians who have legitimate concerns about being vaccinated against COVID-19. But he reiterated his position that widespread vaccine uptake is key to emerging from the pandemic, in a post-debate press conference. Trudeau was pressed to defend his decision to call an election during the Afghanistan crisis. Trudeau reiterated his view that the Canada's military and diplomats managed to get 3,700 people out of Afghanistan and noted the evacuation of 43 more people out of Kabul with the help of Qatar that was disclosed today. --- 11:40 p.m. Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet levelled criticism against debate moderator, Shachi Kurl, saying she unfairly criticized Quebec in how she framed questions. Kurl had referred to the Quebec law that bans some public sector workers such as teachers and police officers from wearing religious symbols on the job, as discriminatory. Blanchet said horrible and rude accusations were made against his province in the preface of questions that suggested the province was racist or intolerant. Blanchet said Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau could have shown more support for Quebec during the debate instead of standing idly by. He said the debate was set up to prevent a discussion of issues of relevant to Quebec. --- 11:25 p.m. The federal leaders are taking questions after the conclusion of the English-language debate. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole dodged a question about how many of his candidates have been vaccinated against COVID-19. He also there should be greater emphasis on rapid testing to help bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. O'Toole reiterated that it was a failure of leadership for Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to call an election with Afghanistan falling, and Canadians still in peril in the country. He said he wants to collaborate with the provinces more closely and eschew an Ottawa-knows-best approach as the country tries to emerge from the pandemic. --- 10:55 p.m. The federal leaders ended the English debate by arguing over their plans to help Canada recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole challenged Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to balance the federal budget after promising tens of billions in new spending. Trudeau said Canada’s economy can't recover from the pandemic if people don't have the support they need to get through it. --- 10:15 The federal leaders sparred over Indigenous reconciliation with Annamie Paul saying the issue should not be treated like a buffet. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh accused Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau of ""taking a knee"" — as he did at an anti-racism rally on Parliament Hill last year — while taking Indigenous kids to court. Singh was referring to Ottawa's controversial legal challenge of a pair of rulings involving First Nations children. Trudeau shot back, saying cynicism is harming reconciliation efforts, and that his government has made progress by getting more Indigenous kids into quality schools and lifting more than 100 boil-water advisories. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says he would like to see the Canadian flag raised again on Sept. 30, the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, with a commitment to ""move forward"" on the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Canadian flag has remained at half-mast on the Peace Tower and other federal buildings since late spring to mark the finding of unmarked graves on the grounds of former residential schools. O'Toole has previously said Canadians ""should be proud to put our flag back up."" --- 9:45 p.m. Justin Trudeau and Jagmeet Singh had a heated exchange about their party's climate change policies. Trudeau said the NDP's climate change policy rates an F while saying that experts have given the Liberal plan high marks. Singh accused Trudeau of presiding over the worst record on fighting climate change in the G7 during his six years in power. Annamie Paul said Canada could become a renewable energy superpower, and all parties need to work together to combat the shared threat. --- 9:25 p.m. Foreign policy has been injected into the English leaders' debate with questions about the fall of Afghanistan and the ongoing imprisonment of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China igniting sparring among the leaders. Erin O'Toole, Jagmeet Singh, Annamie Paul and Yves-François Blanchet piled on Justin Trudeau for calling an election while Afghanistan was falling to the Taliban. Trudeau shot back at his opponents for talking down the work by the military and diplomats to get 3,700 people out of Afghanistan, and 43 more with the help of Qatar earlier today. Trudeau also said his government is doing everything it can to get Kovrig and Spavor out of China, but that work can't be done by lobbing tomatoes at the People's Republic. --- 9:15 p.m. The debate kicks off with a discussion about leadership and accountability as the debate's moderator, Shachi Kurl, asks all five leaders different and challenging questions that put all of them on the defensive. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh deflected a question about his party platform, while Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau talked past a question about his decision to call an election during the pandemic. Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet shot back at a suggestion that his party backs discriminatory laws against minorities. Green Party Leader Annamie Paul is asked whether she can lead a country when she has such internal strife in her party and says she has crawled over a lot of broken glass to get to debate night. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says he is a pro-choice ally of LGBTQ people when about his party members' differing stances on those issues as well as climate change and vaccination. --- 8:30 p.m. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has arrived at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que., in a blue minivan. He stopped to talk to reporters about the need to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Singh says all leaders agree that getting vaccinated is one of the most important things they can do to fight the pandemic and keep people safe. Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet is already inside the museum, having entered through another door. --- 8:20 p.m. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau has arrived at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que., in a black SUV, surrounded by RCMP vehicles. A supporter of the People's Party of Canada screamed into a megaphone: ""You're not my prime minister."""
"2021-09-12","Full text: Debate: Leaders spar over climate, foreign policy OTTAWA - Federal party leaders jousted over climate change, health care, foreign policy, the economy and Indigenous reconciliation during Thursday's English-language debate — their last, best chance to sway voters before the Sept. 20 election. But the format of the debate may have left many viewers unsatisfied. The five leaders frequently talked over one another. Leaders on the receiving end of accusations or loaded questions from rivals were often given no chance to respond. Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet repeatedly complained that he was being given less time than the others to speak. Right off the bat, the role of the moderator, Shachi Kurl, came under fire, with Blanchet taking umbrage at what he termed her suggestion that Quebec is racist. Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, asked Blanchet to explain why he supports ""discriminatory laws"" in Quebec, such as the secularism law banning some public servants in positions of authority from wearing religious garb or symbols. ""Those laws are not about discrimination. They are about the values of Quebec,"" Blanchet responded. After the debate, Blanchet told reporters it was ""extraordinary"" to have the debate open with ""a bunch of insults against Quebecers"" by the moderator. He suggested that Kurl's question reflects a bias against Quebec that is shared in the rest of the country and that it shows Quebec's interests need to be protected. He noted that no other leader came to Quebec's defence. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, who had rounded on Blanchet during Wednesday's French debate for questioning his devotion to Quebec, said the format didn't give him a chance to respond. He reiterated his opposition to the secularism law but added: ""I want to say as a proud Quebecer, Quebecers are not racist."""

"2021-09-12","Full text: When Canadians head to the polls on September 20, they will not only be picking their next government, but the individuals as well who will play integral parts in the nation’s post-COVID recovery. This week, The Auroran asked confirmed candidates why a vote for them and the party they represent is a vote towards Canada’s recovery in the years ahead. NEWMARKET-AURORA The NDP has “always been a party for the people, working class/middle class and those who have been sidelined by poverty and other life hardships,” says party candidate Yvonne Kelly; and an economy that doesn’t work for everyone is “not acceptable to us.” “That is why we are committed to tax reform that will allow us to expand public services and re-invest in ordinary Canadians who have been hit the hardest throughout this pandemic,” she says. “In order to do that, we will implement comprehensive tax reform to increase our revenue streams and that can be done in a number of ways. We will return the corporate tax rate to their 2020 levels, or 18 per cent, while maintaining the small business tax credit at its current level. “We will implement a 1 per cent tax on the wealthiest Canadians (those in excess of $10 million in wealth), close tax loopholes, tackle tax havens, rein in real estate speculation, and make big polluters pay. The Canadians for Tax Fairness Platform for Tax Fairness has estimated that such a comprehensive approach could generate $90 billion in revenues annually. “The other reason that the NDP is the right party to lead the recovery is because we are the people we represent and we understand the struggles of everyday Canadians. It is important that we build back for a just recovery that addresses the disparities that have been revealed as a result of COVID. Women and racialized women have been disproportionately impacted and yet they most often have been the workers on the frontline, in the service industry, in health care settings and in non-for-profit organizations, who didn’t take time off and couldn’t work from home during the pandemic. Our very survival was on their backs. “Having gone through a crisis of such magnitude and understanding where many of the cracks are, we need to learn from this experience and build for the future. We can’t return to the status quo, or continue to leave people behind, and we can’t wait any longer to take ambitious action on climate change.” Conservative candidate Harold Kim says his party has a plan for every program and service “that has gone off the rails in the past six years.” Their recovery plan, he says, will “unleash innovation and move Canada up in the 2020 Global Index from its current standing at 17th in the world for research and development and 21st for technology output.” “We will be investing $5 billion over five years for research and development of hydrogen, electric vehicles and pharmaceutical research and production in Canada in addition to providing tax incentives for buying from a Canadian start-up, financing incentives, to name just a few,” he says. “We have the talent and the natural resources that Canada should be on the world’s radar. We are providing many programs to support the economy. Small businesses are the mainstay of Canada’s economy and have been hit hard by the pandemic. We have included a Rebuild Main Street program that includes providing tax credits, loans and tax credits for capital investments and will be reforming the Business Development Bank of Canada to make it easier to start a business. We are also focussing on the supply side of the economy with our Job Surge Plan. In this plan we will be giving a helping hand to those whose ability to work was affected by the pandemic. But the help isn’t just throwing more money at them and leaving them to fend for themselves without help for the future. Conservatives believe Canadians should have choices about their futures and have provided many options to help Canadians upgrade their skills, start a new career, take additional training or undergo apprenticeship programs to get Canadians back working again in good jobs. “As part of the recovery, we need to ensure this state of unpreparedness [at the start of the pandemic] never happens again. We need to amend our Emergency Preparedness plans, build stockpiles of emergency supplies, including making vaccines domestically and ensure a more responsive relationship with the Provincial Premiers.” For incumbent Liberal candidate Tony Van Bynen, integral in the recovery will be “building a country where we’re tackling the big issues and making sure that nobody gets left behind.” “I genuinely believe that the Liberal Party has the record and the plan to keep making Canada the very best place in the world to live,” he says. “On everything from childcare to housing to climate change, I think we’ll be able to keep making a lot of progress on making peoples’ lives better once we finish the fight against the pandemic.” Recovery, he adds, “obviously” has an economic component but having vaccine mandates in place will be “vital” in getting us “back to our normal lives. “The lack of social interaction and the impact it has on our relationships and our mental health has been a huge challenge for everyone,” he says. “If we’re able to get back to travelling, to more regularly seeing our friends and family, and to safely going to restaurants, concerts, and sporting events – I think that’s going to be the most mentally beneficial part of the recovery for all of us. Vaccines are our path back to being able to do all of that.” AURORA-OAK RIDGES-RICHMOND HILL Since the beginning of the pandemic, Liberal candidate Leah Taylor Roy says her party has had “Canada’s backs” and going forward Canadians “need a government that will support us.” “We fought for businesses and protected millions of jobs,” she says. “We quickly introduced the Emergency Response benefit to ensure Canadians who did lose their jobs didn’t have to worry about paying rent or putting food on the table. We secured one of the most diverse vaccine portfolios in the world and rolled them out ahead of schedule. Canada has weathered this storm better than almost anywhere in the world, and it’s the Liberal government’s leadership that got us there. “Erin O’Toole’s Conservatives want to wind down relief spending when many families, businesses and industries still need it to stay afloat. We can’t afford to move backward and dial down our efforts now. We need to ramp them up to finish this fight and ensure our recovery is strong and sustainable. The Liberals are the only party with the plan and the record to get us to that finish line. Canada has weathered this storm better than almost anywhere else in the world and I am proud of the way most Canadians have come together in communities and helped one another. “We must continue to pull together — to collaborate and respect one another. During this election campaign, I have seen an ugliness that we must work to eradicate. Together we can reduce the anxiety that Canadians are feeling by continuing to focus on vaccinations to end the pandemic. Then, we can continue to work together and move forward for everyone.” Conservative incumbent candidate Leona Alleslev, however, says “Canada is at a tipping point” with economic, social and diplomatic challenges that require “urgent national attention.” “The pandemic has laid bare many of the cracks that previously existed within Canada’s economic and social structures,” she says. “From the ‘quality’ of jobs, to health care standards and access, housing availability and climate change, to the effectiveness of tax programs and consumer protection, many of Canada’s national systems are severely out of balance and in need of fundamental restructuring. Canada must reprioritize national self-sufficiency by investing in domestic capabilities in health, food, energy, and infrastructure. At the same time Canada must also reprioritize international relationships to regain global respect and increase trade with allies and like-minded partners to mitigate our dependence upon nations whose values are in direct conflict with our own. “Canada’s Conservatives have a detailed plan with sound solutions to address all of these critical elements. But more than just a plan, we have a leader and a team that know how to get things done. As a logistics officer in the military, I made sure that our men and women in uniform had what they needed, where and when they needed it, to serve our country. As a senior program manager at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace, I implemented projects that supported critical operations and manufactured airplanes. My Conservative colleagues and I will deliver on Canada’s Recovery plan so that together we will secure Canada’s future.” NDP candidate Janice Hagan, on the other hand, says the NDP doesn’t believe in “trickle down” economics and recovery starts where action is most needed, “such as shaving $20,000 off of student loans and stopping interest on their remaining debt.” “We will invest in housing, green infrastructure and public transit, to create sustainable jobs and improve access to internet and public transit in rural communities,” she says. “We will continue the $2,000 minimum for Employment Insurance, improve EI for the self-employed and increase retraining for new technologies. Small Businesses will also directly benefit from wage and rent subsidies, hiring bonuses and caps on credit card fees. “We need to learn from COVID, who was most vulnerable, and ensure that changes are made to protect everyone. Our seniors living alone and in long term care facilities faced inhumane conditions. Never again. There is no room for profit in long term care. We need a public system with appropriate staffing numbers and standards based on best practices for mental and physical vitality. We also watched the women’s movement leap backwards 50 years as more women were forced from their jobs. The NDP will build a reliable and safe child care system that families can afford at $10/day, expanding the successful Quebec program that has had incredible results. We also need to ensure that there is access to broadband internet and cell phone coverage throughout the country, including in remote areas, and rural pockets even in York Region where internet is spotty.” Subject: Conservatism; Tax rates; Vaccines; Emergency preparedness; Employment; Pandemics; Canadians; Women; Research & development--R & D; Tax credits; Immunization; Tax reform; Climate change; Elections"
"2021-09-12","Full text: The global pandemic has left many feeling isolated, disconnected and, in some cases, without the support networks they would normally have close at hand. As the number of new cases of COVID-19 continues to rise, keeping that “light at the end of the tunnel” just out of reach, residents following the 2021 Federal Election are looking to political leaders for answers on how a vote for them and their party will be a vote in favour of mental health supports. In an election with very different visions for this country’s future, one thing that has united leaders from major political parties is that addressing mental health is more important now than ever before. But, while the theme has united leaders, their respective paths towards solutions diverge. This week, The Auroran reached out to confirmed candidates in both Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill and Newmarket-Aurora on what they are hearing on the mental health front as they go door-to-door and how they plan to address the issues they are hearing from voters. AURORA-OAK RIDGES-RICHMOND HILL Incumbent Conservative nominee Leona Alleslev says residents have shared with her “heartbreaking stories of the mental health and addiction challenges” they and their families have been facing. “They have told me that the pandemic has made things worse and that the critical support they need to help them has been even more difficult to find,” says Ms. Alleslev. “Conservatives know that more needs to be done. We will address this crisis head-on through our Canadian Mental Health Action Plan by immediately restoring health funding to the provinces, and increasing it by at least $60B over the next 10 years, including dedicated funding for mental health treatment, to treat over 1,000,000 additional Canadians annually. “A Conservative government will provide tax incentives for employers to expand their extended health care insurance programs to increase mental health service coverage. Our plan will also create a national suicide prevention hotline and invest at least $150M over the first three years to charities developing mental health programming. Additionally, a Conservative government will revise the federal substance abuse policy framework and invest $325M over three years to create 1,000 residential treatment beds and 50 recovery community centres. With the Conservative Canada’s Recovery Plan, together we will secure mental health for all Canadians.” Residents have been “very open” about their mental health struggles, says Liberal candidate Leah Taylor Roy, with one resident saying, “I’ve lost two years of my life.” “This is heartbreaking to hear, and it sums up what many of us, especially youth, are feeling,” she says. “Our youth have been intensely affected by the impacts of this pandemic – they’ve lost time in school, time with their friends, and just time to enjoy being young. In a different way, many seniors have been suffering as well from the isolation of this pandemic.” As such, Ms. Taylor Roy says a re-elected Liberal government will support “better, more accessible mental health care for all Canadians” as mental health “needs to be treated with the same urgency as any other illness.” “We will deliver high-quality, free mental health services across Canada by providing funding through the Canada Mental Health Transfer. We will support students on campus by hiring 1,200 new counsellors and ensure all Canadians have access to mental health crisis and suicide prevention services through a national hotline. As many Canadians continue to work from home, with more and more workplaces going permanently remote, the right to disconnect is urgent and can be implemented easily. The line between work and home has become increasingly blurred throughout the pandemic, and we will work with labour groups to ensure that line is very clear.” NDP candidate Janice Hagan describes mental illness as “the biggest cause of personal disability” in the country, one which is hitting young people between the ages of 35 and 45 very hard. “Yet, this disability often goes untreated and even undiagnosed as mental health is not covered by OHIP until it is far too serious,” she says. “The NDP will build a more comprehensive public health care system that includes mental health specialists and prescription drugs. We will also bring in a guaranteed liveable income and expand employment programs for people with disabilities. We will end for-profit home care and long-term care so that the most vulnerable in our communities will have quality care based on standards not profit margins. “Aurora, Oak Ridges and Richmond Hill are wealthy communities, but they also illustrate the growing gap between the very rich and the very poor in Canada. We may not have a lot of obviousness homelessness and poverty, but couch surfing, a growing opioid crisis and chronic isolation are obvious problems that are threatening community health. I have heard of long waiting lines for addiction problems and little help for families dealing with sometimes violent or inconsolable family members who need more than a short visit to a care centre. Everyone should have access to mental health and crisis care they need.” NEWMARKET-AURORA The past 18 months have been “obviously incredibly challenging,” says incumbent Liberal candidate Tony Van Bynen and has only highlighted “just how important it is to take care of our own mental health.” “I’ve personally been advocating for better mental health care as a member of the Health Committee in Ottawa, so I am very proud that we’re committing to billions of dollars in new funding for mental health,” he says. “We’ll also bring in a three-digit mental health line, similar to 911, to make sure that people who are in crisis are able to get the support they need immediate. “I haven’t necessarily had people sharing their own struggles [as I have gone door-to-door] but lots of folks have mentioned friends and family who have gone through difficult times with their mental health. This is something that everyone in our community is going to be touched with in one way or another, so it is important that we have supports in place for people to get the help they need and deserve.” From the perspective of NDP candidate Yvonne Kelly, mental health “just like dental care and prescription drug care” all fall under the banner of “health care.” “COVID took a tremendous toll on the mental health of Canadians, in particular our young people, and we believe mental health care should be provided at no cost for those who need it,” she says. “An NDP government will bring in mental health care for uninsured Canadians and our pharmacare plan will mean free and accessible prescription medications for mental health. We will work with provinces and territories to create comprehensive access to mental health services across Canada. Our action and advocacy on the health portfolio demonstrates that we are the party that will deliver on these promises! “People are struggling with so many pressures and external factors that are seemingly outside of their control, which is exacerbating mental health challenges. Not knowing where they are going to move to or what they can afford, when they learn their landlord is selling the house is one [concern from residents] that I’ve heard many times over. Continual worry about the pandemic, particularly for those who are frontline workers either in health care or the service industry who don’t have the luxury of working from home, presents ongoing stress, increased anxiety and, in many cases, depression. I spoke to a young woman just today who is consumed with worry that if we do go into a fourth wave and lockdown due to COVID she will not have earned enough in the last few months to qualify for benefits and she won’t be able to maintain her housing. She said she wasn’t sure that her mental health could handle another lockdown particularly with the worry of how this will impact her financially.” Conservative candidate Harold Kim meanwhile says mental health issues have been “brewing for many years” and the virus has prompted “a significant spike” in mental health cases that make it “impossible for the Liberals to ignore.” “The chronic erosion of federal transfers to the provinces for healthcare has also made this worse, putting mounting pressure on the provinces to cover the shortfalls,” he says, adding a Conservative government has made mental health one of the five pillars of its platform. “We will be investing nearly $60 billion over the next 10 years to health care, marking a 6 per cent increase in funding transfers. Our first priority on this front will be to work with the provinces who deliver health care programs to invest in mental health, with the goal of providing enough funding for an additional million Canadians to receive mental health treatments every year. We will be looking at every opportunity to provide desperate support for these individuals who are often faced with year-long wait times for help. We will be encouraging employers to add mental health coverage to employee benefit plans, providing $150 million over three years for grants and non-profits delivering mental health programs and create a three-digit suicide prevention hotline. “While Tony Van Bynen is Chair of the Standing Committee on Health and has raised concerns about the impact that COVID has had on mental health, after six years, the funding issue for individuals hasn’t been touched. Canadians don’t have the time to wait while the Liberals claim to care, wring their hands and do nothing.” Subject: Canadians; Handicapped accessibility; Funding; Mental health care; Disability; Health services; Pandemics; Elections; Mental disorders; COVID-19"
"2021-09-12","Full text: The President of the Manitoba Metis Federation (MMF) says he believes a new incentive program will convince more Métis people in Manitoba to get out and vote, and he said he has no concerns that the program could be considered unethical by Canadians or by Elections Canada. On Wednesday MMF announced the Get out and Vote contest, a program that they said will incentivize voter participation in the upcoming federal election, through draws that could lead to voters winning prizes like a brand new car or a PlayStation 5. “Any Red River Métis Nation Citizen, or individual able to demonstrate that they are eligible to become a citizen, who takes a picture outside of a polling station and tags the MMF, will have their name put into a draw,” MMF said in a Wednesday press release. While speaking on Thursday, MMF President David Chartrand said he believes the program is necessary, because voter turnout is typically low among Indigenous and Métis people, and they want the candidates to understand that issues that concern these groups should be top of mind. “If you look at how the voter system is catered in this country, it’s catered to the rich, and it’s catered to the middle and upper classes, because they create more and more rules that make it harder for those who are poor or low income to vote,” Chartrand said. “There are so many factors for different groups in Canada for why they don’t vote, especially when you look at the Indigenous and the Métis.” Because of that lower turnout among Indigenous and Métis citizens, Chartrand said he believes candidates often don’t take the issues of those groups as seriously as they should, because they do not believe if they do it will translate into votes. “So if some communities have a low turnout, then the politicians can look at those numbers and say, ‘why the hell and I wasting my time with those issues, because they don’t vote anyways, so we don’t have to worry about what their concerns are.’ “We just can’t hope for them to vote or plead with them to vote, we need to educate people that the politicians turn their attention to you if you vote, and that’s what this is all about.” Chartrand said that he wants to make it clear the program is not about telling anyone who to vote for, and he does not believe it could be considered unethical or suspect by anyone. “This is not about anyone voting for a specific party,” he said. “We are not telling anyone who to vote for, we are saying ‘here is the platform of each party in regards to issues and questions that concern the Métis, so you decide what affects you directly, and what affects your family and your community. “And from there you can choose what party will best serve you.” Political scientist and University of Manitoba Professor of Political Studies Christopher Adams said on Thursday that he can’t say one way or another if he thinks the incentive program is legal or ethical, and those questions all come down to whether or not it can be considered a bribe. “The Elections Act does clearly say that it’s against the law to bribe someone to vote or to not vote, or to vote for a specific candidate,” Adams said. “So it makes it an offence to bribe someone to go to the voting station. “So the question is, ‘how do you define a bribe?’ And is a contest a bribe if people aren’t guaranteed they will be receiving something, and if they aren’t being told who to vote for?” The Canada Elections act states in Section 282.7 that “No person shall, during an election period, directly or indirectly, offer a bribe to influence an elector to vote or refrain from voting, or to vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate or registered party, at the election.” Adams added that it has to be asked if a contest like this is similar to programs set up by political organizations that offer rides to voting stations, something which is currently commonplace during elections in Canada. “Political parties and organizations will do things in an election to encourage people to vote, including driving them to voting station so than you have to ask, ‘ “So these are the grey areas, and this is where it is a question of whether or not you are stepping over that line.” The Winnipeg Sun reached out to Elections Canada for comment, but did not hear back before Thursday’s press deadline. — Dave Baxter is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the Winnipeg Sun.

"2021-09-12","Full text: A former candidate for Muskeg Lake Cree Nation council wants the Federal Court of Canada to reverse the First Nation's last election. Alvin Arcand applied for judicial review in Edmonton on Aug. 27, alleging an election held last March broke the band's election rules partly by offering online voting to accommodate pandemic concerns. ""They're not listening to the band members. They're making decisions on their own,"" Arcand said. In the band's March election, he received 203 votes, denying him one of five on-reserve council seats. He alleges online ballots didn't comply with the First Nation's election rules about distance voting. He also alleges that electors received multiple ballots, administrative staff wrongly participated in handling the election, and that there was a lack of transparency during ballot counting where mail-in submissions also weren't included. Dianne Lafond, the band's director of operations, declined to comment. As part of his application, Arcand wants to quash an appeal tribunal's decision from July 28. The band's tribunal decision found the chief electoral officer was entitled to use electronic voting for public safety purposes without undergoing a long referendum to formally change the band's elections rules. The decision applied the same logic to restricting attendance to where votes were being counted, which it said didn't purposefully limit transparency. The band's defence calculated that even if online votes were left out entirely, the election results would be the same. ""An interpretation of distance balloting that prohibited electronic ballots would be inconsistent with the right of eligible (First Nation) members to vote, particularly in light of the health and safety concerns associated with gathering as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the defence said. Similarly, if each of the band's candidates had someone oversee ballot counting in person, the required numbers would have broken public health orders. Ballot counting instead took place over livestream, the defence documents say. The chief electoral officer received no complaints over that process, according to the documents; Arcand also said no other candidates have reached out to him with concerns. The band defence noted the chief electoral officer sent out 10 mail-in ballots and received seven back. It added that one member received two electronic ballots, but she informed the chief electoral officer of the mistake and did not vote twice. However, Arcand's federal court application says he tried to include witnesses in the tribunal via video call to speak to double-voting and online challenges, but his request was denied. Regarding conflicts of interest, the defence also argued that an administrative staff member wasn't appointed as a deputy electoral officer, but that person did give out masks and hand sanitizer and offered directions at an Edmonton polling station.

"2021-09-12","Full text: In her professional life, Janice Hagan’s colleagues often vote for her to be a voice for their concerns. It is not a role that she takes lightly and, as the NDP candidate for Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill, Ms. Hagan is hoping to be a voice for local concerns in Ottawa following the September 20 Federal Election. Ms. Hagan, an employee at Seneca College, has entered the race to carry the orange banner. This will not be the first time she has stood as a candidate for the NDP and has, in fact, been on the ballot before when portions of Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill were in different ridings. Now, as the confirmed candidate, she is eager to take her message to voters, one that is focused on the environment and climate change. “This year, the big issues are environment and climate change because we have 10 years really to make a huge difference in turning this around – and it’s now or never, right?” Addressing climate change is not, she says, “about passing laws to give people tax breaks if they don’t pollute” as the impacts of climate change are “interwoven into everything else.” “You can’t just fix one problem,” says Ms. Hagan on why she aligns with the NDP’s environmental platform versus those of other parties. “The NDP is about putting in plans right now to start re-training, to start making strategies of how we can create green jobs to move people into. By 2030, we want to cut emissions by 50 per cent, where the Liberals are more about by 2050 we will have no more emissions – but how do we get there? We have to start now.” Part of that starting off point is what she describes as the “Just Transition” focusing on people who will be “affected the most” by these policies, particularly people who work in “carbon-based industries.” “The NDP understands that all these things are connected,” she says, citing rising temperatures and the impact this has on the Gulf Stream. “You can’t just reduce emissions – that’s a popular notion – but you have to actually look at the whole problem and fix everything. I love their idea of a Climate Corps, like a Peace Corps for young people on climate change. One of the things I like to do with my husband in our spare time is we work on the waterways and the wetlands around where we live [and take out invasive species] to bring in more native plants. We can have people doing that – maybe not getting paid a lot but getting food and board like in the Peace Corps, getting experience on their resumes, getting outside and learning about the environment, which we really need. It’s hard to expect the private sector to clean up the waterways; we have to do it as a community.” Ms. Hagan says her party “has always been on the side of the working class” but it’s getting harder to live in Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill. There is a “serious problem” with housing costs and to address this problem she says it is essential to “get the Federal government into building houses again.” Another key factor in addressing the issue of affordability is an expansion of health care, she says. “The government is already paying for so many people’s drugs as it – all the public workers who have benefits plans, everybody who is on social assistance, seniors, people in hospital – and it is not going to cost that much to be able to add more people to it,” she says. “If there is one buyer for drugs, we can negotiate better prices. [We want] a health care system that includes drugs, mental health care for people who are vulnerable in our society who can’t afford it.” As a mom of three who are just getting past the university age, she says she knows firsthand the problem of student debt and addressing this is also a matter of affordability, which can be tackled by having people “who have made $17 billion more since the lockdown last year to start paying for some of the services that help people build this society where they are able to make so much money.” “They are benefiting from a workforce that gets free healthcare, gets good, strong education and they can pay a little bit more for those services and help us get out of the recession instead of it just coming off the backs of our young people who can’t even afford a place to live,” she says, before touting the benefits of instituting a living wage. “If everyone has a living wage, which is different from minimum wage which means you can buy food and shelter for your family but you can also send your kids to swimming lessons or buy a new shirt, having people with a little bit of extra income actually improves our community because people can buy things, store owners can make money, they can pay better taxes and the money moves faster. Money being hoarded in bank accounts in nice, hot countries is not really helping our economy at all. “People like to think the NDP likes to spend, spend, spend, but there are certain things we’re not going to spend on like subsidies for oil companies to do further exploration on an old technology that is not going to move forward for the planet. There is money there we can spend and just getting the economy going again, giving people spending money, creating decent jobs where people make good money, this is how to improve our communities, but a lot of people think we’ll go into debt and that’s not the case. You go into debt when you divide the rich and the poor so far that the poor can only pay their necessary bills and buy food and the rich are putting all their money overseas. That does not help our economy.” Subject: Emissions; Climate change; Employment; Elections"

"2021-09-12","Full text: With four out of six candidates for the West Niagara riding in attendance, the first of four federal election debates kicked off on YourTV Niagara. The incumbent for West Niagara, Dean Allison of the Conservative Party of Canada, went up against Nameer Rahman of the NDP, Joanna Kocsis of the Green party and Ian Bingham of the Liberal party. Not in attendance were Christian Heritage Party’s Harold Jonker and People’s Party of Canada's Shaunalee Derkson, who submitted a video that was shared at the end of the debate. Here are some stand out moments of the Sep. 7 debate. Joanna Kocsis — on the timing of the election “We know that the care work of child care and caring for aging relatives in the fourth wave of a pandemic falls disproportionately on women, that this is not a good time for us to have to be redirecting our energies and our efforts to other things. So I think calling an election at this time was meant to deliberately exclude women from positions of power."" Dean Allison — on the Liberal government’s response to Afghanistan “There are all kinds of people that helped the allies and I believe what happened during this campaign was absolutely disgraceful, in terms of the timing of trying to get these people out. This should’ve been done months ago. We need to do more to get the people out, that are there now.” Nameer Rahman — on the Liberal government’s response to Afghanistan “My wife is Afghan-Canadian and she has family members who are currently being hunted by the Taliban and we reached out to the Liberal government to bring them over and there was no response,” Rahman said. He later added, “There are families out here, who will bring in, will support their family members and won’t ask a dime from the government. But their lives are at risk, these refugees, and we need to do better and I know for a fact that this Liberal government has failed miserably.” Ian Bingham — on ‘kick-starting’ the economy “I’m so proud of Canadians every day. I found recently, 92 per cent of jobs in COVID in Canada have been restored versus, I’m to understand 75 per cent of those in the United States. We’re very lucky to live in this country,” he said. “But we need to do more.” Shaunalee Derkson — on vaccine passports “This single action will further divide and alienate our people. This also includes family and friends. I can see job loss, small business closures, more unemployment, isolation and depression and many of us are not going to be able to participate in everyday society. This should concern everyone. Everyone should be able to feel free to make their own choices.” The broadcast of the debate is available on YourTV's website, yourtv.tv/niagara. Subject: Prime ministers; Debates"

"2021-09-11","Full text: The federal election will have the Grande Prairie–Mackenzie residents back at the polls on Sept. 20. Town & Country News continues its dialog with candidates as they come forward. Parti Rhinocéros Party - Donovan Eckstrom Donovan Eckstrom has entered the political ring again for the Parti Rhinocéros Party. The Sexsmith resident first entered the bid for a seat a decade ago, when he was 19. “I ran in 2011 up in Peace River against Chris Warkentin and Jennifer Villebrun, and it's like a big reunion 10 years later, it's like the Friends reunion, but boring because its politics,” said Eckstrom. He previously ran in Edmonton ridings while attending university before completing the Bachelor of Education program and making his way back to the South Peace. “I feel like eventually, I might win. You can’t do it if you don’t try,” said Eckstrom. Since entering the political ring as a young adult, he said he feels like he has aged 30 years. “I think I'm both wiser and a little stupider, so it's a beautiful thing.” The Rhino platform is making some changes this year. “We want to one-up all of the separatist parties and actually kick the rest of Canada, out of Quebec, and the West,” explained Eckstrom. “We, as a Rhino government, if elected, promise to recognize Pluto as a planet. I think that's a good relationship builder there.” If elected, Eckstrom said, “I would sacrifice my sanity so that the Peace country would have a voice in every boring parliamentary subcommittee and sub-sub-committee.” He also noted that if elected, “it would be a fate worse than death.” Eckstrom shrugged at the mention of the economy, saying that it was another boring subject. “The Rhinos will continue our promise from 1967 to replace Canada's currency with bubble gum that way we can control inflation a little bit better,” he said. Ultimately above all else, Eckstrom said, “I promise not to keep any of my promises.” In the last election, Eckstrom said that 73 per cent of people went out to vote in the region. “Nobody wants this election, and there are about 20,000 people who didn't vote, and one can say that's certainly about apathy. “They might just be completely checked out, but there's a lot of people that said I don't vote because I don't like anybody, and I hope to be that option. “I'm essentially the none of the above option, and it gives you an opportunity to protest while still practicing your civic duty of voting.” The Grande Prairie-Mackenzie riding has six candidates that also include CPC’s Chris Warkentin, Liberal Dan Campbell, PPC Shawn McLean, Maverick Ambrose Ralph and NDP Jennifer Villebrun.

"2021-09-11","Full text: COVID-19 recovery, vaccine mandates and climate change were some of the big topics federal candidates for the Niagara Falls riding debated in Niagara-on-the-Lake Tuesday night. The debate, hosted by The Lake Report at Ravine Vineyard Estate Winery, had an interesting start. New Democratic Party candidate Brian Barker cancelled his appearance late Tuesday afternoon after experiencing COVID-like symptoms. Karrie Porter, a municipal councillor in St. Catharines, stepped in for Barker to represent the party. She was welcomed with boos by a small contingent and one woman said if Barker wasn’t there then Porter shouldn’t be in his seat. Porter responded that public health officials ordered Barker to isolate and he is doing the right thing. Liberal candidate Andrea Kaiser apologized to Porter for having to endure the boorish behaviour. “We truly appreciate that (you are here) and I’m sorry that the comments and the booing were made. We, and I, value you being here,” Kaiser said to Porter during her opening comments. Porter noted she appreciates ""a civil debate and I think it’s incredibly important that we have these civil debates during election time.” But moderator Patrick Little ensured levity throughout the nearly 90-minute debate. After applause breaks every time a candidate spoke, Little addressed the time-wasting habit. “Curtail the applause in total or at least shorten it so we don’t spend most of the evening listening to applause,” he told the crowd. His request was met with resounding applause from the packed event space. Little held his head in his hands and said, “Be careful what you wish for.” The debate kicked off with candidates staking their ground on the issue of climate change. Conservative candidate Tony Baldinelli, the incumbent, drew attention to his party's platform released in April, saying the Tories will invest in nuclear, natural gas and hydrogen technologies as well as accelerate the deployment of carbon capture technology. He claimed the Conservative party would reduce emissions by 29 per cent over the next nine years. Kaiser offered no specifics for how she would address climate change but said the issue is what got her involved in politics. “There’s no question that this is a crisis we are facing,” she said. She touted the Liberal plan as an ambitious but pragmatic one, saying the New Democratic plan was overly optimistic and the Conservatives didn’t go far enough. She mentioned Dr. Mark Jaccard, an economist at Simon Fraser University, who graded the Liberal climate plan an 8 out of 10, and gave the Conservatives and New Democrats a 5 and 2, respectively. During an interview on the YouTube channel Energi Media, Jaccard said the Liberals have succeeded in implementing necessary but tough measures such as a carbon tax. Jaccard used a modelling device from Navius Research to conduct an empirical analysis of the party's plans, buffeted by his judgment calls on the data, he said. Porter said the NDP would address the climate crisis but wouldn’t do it on the economic backs of average Canadians. “Large polluters need to pay their share,” Porter said. “We’re going to create thousands of good jobs by investing in clean energy. The Liberal and Conservative plans rely on fossil fuels.” People’s Party of Canada candidate Peter Taras approached the topic from a different standpoint. Taras spent most of the debate espousing the importance of personal freedom and criticizing big government. His comments were often met with rowdy cheers from a small group of purple-clad supporters seated together at the venue. Taras said the entire climate movement is hypocritical, since the Paris Climate Accord was signed by politicians who flew in on jets. If elected, he said his party would withdraw from the Paris accord and argued that if individuals want to do something about climate change then it's up to them alone. Candidates were asked how they would help the Niagara Region and NOTL recover from the economic impact of the pandemic. Baldinelli said the Conservatives would cover up to 50 per cent of the cost of a new hire to help businesses find workers. He also said they would maintain the wage and rent subsidy programs longer than the Liberals would. Kaiser said by pushing vaccinations the Liberals will help the province avoid further lockdowns and help businesses get back to normal. Porter spoke about the issue of large companies profiting from the pandemic while the average Canadian struggles financially. “Small businesses pay tax, working people pay tax. It’s time for the people who have profited during this pandemic to pay tax. That is how we are going to get out of this recession from the pandemic,” she said with a reference to Amazon. Taras said the restrictions brought about by the pandemic, such as lockdowns and wearing masks, were needless and did more harm than good. He referenced the United Nations worldwide death statistics to prove his point before saying his party would completely open up the Canada-U.S. border. Candidates were asked if Canada needs a federal vaccine passport and how they would comfort people afraid of getting vaccinated. Porter said she understands vaccine hesitancy, as she went through the same fear when her children were required to get vaccinated. At the time, there was misinformation circulating that vaccines could cause autism, she said. But she emphasized she worked with a doctor to understand the issue and said society has a responsibility to protect the vulnerable. “(COVID-19 has) killed people that I know. It’s killed people I know who’ve been previously healthy. I do support a vaccine certificate,” Porter said. “Compassion and understanding are important but we also have to put people's lives first and protect them. COVID is real.” Taras said his party does not support vaccine passports and referred to the measure as “medical apartheid,” saying it should be each individual's choice. “Even if it’s going to make me stronger, smarter and taller, I should still have the choice to take it,” he said. He also questioned the seriousness of COVID, claiming it has been exaggerated. Baldinelli also said his party supports Canadians' right to choose. “However, vaccination is a safe and effective tool to stop the spread of COVID-19 and we encourage everyone who is able to take one,” he said. He said he did not support the Liberal plan to make a double dose of vaccines mandatory for travel or for federal workers, saying his party would ensure people take tests and prove a negative result before boarding a plane or train or going to work. Baldinelli did say a Conservative government would work to implement a vaccine certificate for international travel, noting the inevitability that governments around the world will require proof of vaccination for incoming travellers. Kaiser pointed to the suffering of anti-vaxers dying from COVID as a reason to get vaccinated. “At the end of the day, a COVID test saying you have COVID is too late. It’s really as simple as that,” she said to loud applause. “It’s time to do our part. It’s time to get vaccinated and to protect each other. It’s not a new concept. We vaccinated babies when we had polio.” Kaiser also spoke about her children needing vaccines to attend public school and emphasized that vaccine certificates have a long history in Canada. * Watch The Lake Report debate video on YouTube at www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpbs8OZAaAc.

"2021-09-11","Full text: Hundreds of ethnic media outlets exist across Canada and advocates say they are crucial in getting minority communities to vote in the upcoming Sept. 20 federal election. Madeline Ziniak, chair of the Canadian Ethnic Media Association, said that ethnic media — which tend to be produced for a particular ethnic and linguistic community — are a pillar of communication in Canada. Ethnic media is “even more effective than mainstream or traditional media in encouraging people” to vote because they are more connected and personalized towards their communities, she said. Ziniak said reporters of ethnic media are able to form a bond of trust with their audience because they communicate in their communities’ “language of comfort” and, unlike mainstream media which reports information to a large swath, they works to convey information that is relevant to a specific community. A study conducted in the U.S. (2019) showed that neighbourhoods with regular local news coverage have better voter turnout with higher levels of community engagement. Andrew Griffith, a fellow of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute and the Environics Institute, said ethnic media helps make sure communities are reasonably informed to vote, though this doesn’t mean they are “well informed.” “I wouldn’t say well informed because if you only follow certain media, you’re not well informed. You would have a sense of the issues that are perhaps more relevant to your community … but that’s not unique to ethnic media,” he told New Canadian Media. In an analysis of the 2015 federal election, Griffith found that ethnic media helped to encourage political participation and understanding of issues and party positions. For instance, on Oct. 20, 2015, the Romanian ethnic media outlet, Pagini Romanesti, wrote, “There is no stupid vote in a democracy. Think about, if you still choose Canada as your adopted country, how you want the country to look, how you want to leave it for your children.” The analysis suggests that rather than reinforcing siloes, ethnic media outlets encourage political integration. Griffith also found that local ethnic media reflect a certain pride in the community, with many visible minority candidate profiles highlighting their ethnic or immigrant backgrounds. Ziniak said that the importance of ethnic media is only increasing as they reach targeted communities and focus on their information needs. “Journalists from these communities know the sensitive points … [and] inner workings of the community that they serve,” she said. Silke Reichrath is the editor-in-chief of Multilingual International Research and Ethnic Media Services (MIREMS), a firm that tracks and translates stories from more than 800 ethnic media outlets in Canada. She said ethnic media has long played a part in integrating immigrants into Canada by allowing them access to media in their native language. “It helps people feel more like they’re Canadians by making the Canadian political system more transparent and understandable and bringing it to them,” she told NCM in an interview. Ziniak said there are specific barriers that ethnic communities may face which ethnic media can help break through. “Sometimes, depending on which ethnic group you’re dealing with, they haven’t always been accustomed to a democratic voting process,” she said. “So, (it’s) important to encourage those from various ethnic communities who perhaps did not have the opportunity in their country of origin to exercise that democratic right to vote.” In recent elections, politicians have increasingly given their attention to ethnic media to better understand the conversations taking place in their communities. There are 338 federal ridings in Parliament and 41 of these have populations where visible minorities form the majority, NCM has reported. In fact, according to a 2016 Statistics Canada report, immigrants make up over 20 per cent of Canada’s population. It is here where politicians are looking to garner the ‘ethnic vote.’ Ziniak said it’s important for politicians to not only take a look at the needs of ethnic communities during election time, but also for it to be consistent. “(Ethnic media is) not only to call upon when they (politicians) know they can garner votes and be opportunistic. It has to be intrinsically recognized.” Silke said “candidates and policymakers can improve by inviting ethnic media to their press conferences” but mostly, ethnic media needs more resources and funding. The 2015 analysis by Griffith suggests that ethnic media largely mirror mainstream media in their coverage of election issues; less in-depth issue coverage. Silke said this is often because a lot of smaller ethnic media outlets rely on press releases and translating mainstream media articles as they lack resources. “They don’t have the resources to do a lot of firsthand research and interviews and actually put people in the field.” — With additional reporting by Lu Xu.

"2021-09-11","Full text: This is the third of five profiles of candidates for the Kootenay-Columbia riding. The Kootenay way of life needs a champion. Whether it is for affordable living, housing, access to healthcare, staff shortages, softwood lumber or being on the front lines of climate change, Liberal candidate Robin Goldsbury is ready to step into the ring for the Kootenay-Columbia riding. “Solutions to big city problems often don't work here,” she said. Goldsbury’s platform is all about sustainable Kootenay vitality, inclusive collaboration and the need for an experienced, local voice in Ottawa. “We need determination, passion and hard work to keep our small communities on the federal radar,” she said. Goldsbury is from the Crowsnest Pass but moved to the Cranbrook area 30 years ago, managing corporate marketing with Adeas — an in-house ad agency at Koocanusa Publications where she wrote the popular feature, Healthline — and designing successful marketing campaigns for many Kootenay businesses. For over 30 years the same issues that beset Kootenay businesses — staffing, succession and profitability mired by climate change, government policy and burn-out — have also afflicted Goldsbury and she has learned first hand what it takes to meet them. “Together we have the creative, collaborative and workable solutions for sustainable vitality in our small communities,” she said. “What's needed is the enthusiasm and the smarts to grab the government's attention and get the work done.” Goldsbury built a value-added forestry business that sold forest products to the floral trade worldwide. Her Kootenay Cone Company was the first licensed botanical collector in British Columbia, and at its peak employed 45 people. She also developed many sustainable harvesting techniques still in use today. After 10 years in forestry Goldsbury returned to school and completed a master’s degree in neuroscience. She landed on Kootenay Lake in 2007 where she and her partner built the iconic Dock n Duck Resort at the Balfour Ferry Landing. In 2014 Robin was recognized as a “Top 10 Kootenay Business Operator.” But it was the federal climate of the early 2010’s that prompted Goldsbury’s return to politics. While in college, Goldsbury represented over 60,000 students as Alberta Student Executive Council (ACTISEC) chair, and managed to glean a personal letter of recommendation from Brian Mulroney. However, she found her home in the Liberal Party of Canada where she’s actively formed policy with the National Women’s Commission and pushed for the new Ministry of Rural Economic Development. Goldsbury is also working on extended healthcare policies, green transportation and the new Adaptation Strategy for Climate Change. The 2021 federal election goes Sept. 20.

"2021-09-11","Full text: Town of Sexsmith Regular Meeting of Council September 7, 2021 In Attendance: Mayor Kate Potter,"
"2021-09-11","Full text: The Village of Big Valley council decided they will wait until after the upcoming municipal election to discuss boosting their regular meetings to two a month. The decision was made at the Aug. 26 regular meeting of council. Village Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Tracy Mindus brought forward the item which had been discussed previously by council. She stated the proposal was to increase the number of regular council meetings to two a month; Big Valley currently has one regular council meeting per month, every fourth Thursday at 1 p.m. The proposal was to add another meeting on the second Thursday. It was noted in the report that another council meeting per month would also require authorization for councillors to be paid for that meeting. Mayor Clark German asked if the extra meeting could be scheduled in the evening so those residents who work during the day could attend if they wish. Coun. Harry Nibourg responded that the reason the village has meetings at 1 p.m. currently is to save on staff working after hours. German responded the CAO is salaried, so it would have no effect on the taxpayers. Mindus added she didn’t have a problem with evening meetings. Coun. Art Tizzard, looking at the $3,000 more in remuneration to be paid to councillors for 12 more meetings a year, felt the council should stick with one meeting and call special council meetings if needed. Nibourg agreed. German pointed out that if all the special meetings councillors attend were added up it would probably fit into one regular council meeting per month. Nibourg responded that many special meetings were back to back to discuss a specific issue. Mayor German stated he felt an extra council meeting would allow councillors to talk about issues he felt hadn’t received enough attention, such as economic development. Mindus pointed out special meetings cause issues for staff as there’s less preparation time compared to a regular meeting and special meetings can be called with 24 hours notice, which doesn’t always give taxpayers a chance to attend. Nibourg suggested tabling this topic and letting the new council decide on it after the election. Tizzard stated he wasn’t planning on running for re-election so this decision wouldn’t affect him anyway. Councillors agreed to table the topic of a second council meeting per month. Recreation committee Mindus reported to councillors the community has shown interest in forming a recreation committee. Councillors previously instructed the CAO to gauge interest in Big Valley, and she stated four community members have come forward. The CAO presented a few options, such as forming a society or having the committee under the village umbrella. Councillors decided to move first reading of the bylaw to form the committee, then instructed Mindus to meet with the community members to develop terms of reference. She stated she would try to meet with them in the evening within two weeks. CAO report The CAO reminded councillors nomination day for the municipal election is Sept. 20, and added that she recently acquired new ballot boxes from the City of Calgary “super cheap.” Mindus reported Skyla Attfield has been hired as the new village administrative assistant. She added that she did the admin assistant job for about a month in addition to her own job. Also, the CAO stated she’s been working remotely Mondays and Fridays and in the office. However, as of Sept. 1 she will be working only remotely until nomination day. Mindus reported many cat tags have gone out to the public after councillors added cats to the animal control bylaw. More tags are needed as the village is running low. There are plenty of dog tags on hand, however. Mayor German noted councillors may have more decisions to make about cats, such as enforcement and kennels, and Mindus noted she’s been calling around to gather some information. Councillors accepted the CAO’s report for information. Housing authority The village won’t inquire about the caretaker position currently available for County of Stettler Housing Authority's buildings in Big Valley. Mindus presented councillors with a notice the authority sent out for a caretaker position in Big Valley. Mindus noted she was trying to contact the person responsible for the advertisement at the housing authority but had no luck. Councillors discussed the nature of the caretaker position, such as early morning call-outs and liability and decided they were not interested. Office hours Councillors approved changes to the village office hours. The village office will be open Monday to Thursday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and closed from noon to 12:30 for lunch. The office remains closed Fridays. Nibourg stated there’s demand for the office to be open more often. LUB amendment Councillors approved a change to the wording of the Land Use Bylaw (LUB) after it had been publicly advertised. Mindus stated a section of the bylaw pertaining to fees and charges had to be re-worded, and the revised bylaw already passed first reading as well. The changes included removing a sentence stating certain development matters are set by resolution of council, and replaced with a reference to the fees and charges bylaw. Councillors passed second and third reading of the revised bylaw. Closed session Coun. Nibourg asked that an item be added to the closed session of the agenda. It was stated the topic was lifting of council sanctions on him. Councillors approved it, and it was the only closed session item listed on the agenda.

With under two weeks to go, millions of voters were expected to tune in to the two-hour French-language debate and then the English-language debate Thursday night. They come as opinion polls suggest the Liberals and Conservatives are stuck in a tight two-way race, with the NDP and Bloc poised to determine which of the two main parties emerges victorious. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul took part in the Wednesday debate and will convene again Thursday night at 9 p.m. eastern time. People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier did not meet the criteria established by the independent Leaders' Debates Commission for participation. Organized by consortiums of broadcasters, both debates are being held at the Canadian Museum of History — its grand hall transformed into a television studio — in Gatineau, Que., just across the river from Parliament Hill. The topics discussed Wednesday included climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and Indigenous Peoples and cultural identity. The spiciest exchange, however, concerned issues of Quebec identity and representation when an animated Trudeau turned on Blanchet late in the debate. “You keep forgetting: I’m a Quebecer, I’m a proud Quebecer, I have always been a Quebecer, I will always be a Quebecer,"" Trudeau said, his face flushed, while a small smile slid across Blanchet's."

"2021-09-11","Full text: This federal election sees a record-number of self-declared Indigenous candidates vying for seats in Ottawa at 77 and that could translate into a record number of Members of Parliament. Courtney Skye, research fellow with the Indigenous think-tank the Yellowhead Institute, isn’t confident that higher numbers of Indigenous MPs will mean a stronger stand on Indigenous issues. “I think until Indigenous people are elected they don’t really know the dynamics of being in caucus and being a part of a party,” she said. She points to Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was recruited by Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, elected in 2015 in the British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville, and appointed as Attorney General. By the time Wilson-Raybould ran successfully for re-election in 2019 she had been expelled from the Liberal caucus and seeking a seat as an Independent. Wilson-Raybould, who was a former Assembly of First Nations Regional Chief for BC and a lawyer, had plenty of experience in the political realm. “She was confronted with a lot of issues. (She) had a very strong agenda, very motivated to create change for her people and was stymied within the Liberal Party in not being able to affect the change she wanted to see. She came out very vocally that there was no hope in changing the system from within,” said Skye. Wilson-Raybould’s book “Indian” in the Cabinet: Speaking Truth to Power comes out on Sept. 14. The tell-all book will examine her experience in the Trudeau Cabinet and her struggles."

"2021-09-11","Full text: High schoolers in matching blue, red or orange t-shirts chat behind tables filled with food and coolers stocked with bottles of water to battle the scorching heat. Community elders sit in the shade of hastily erected gazebos, while current and former politicians earnestly greet anyone who hovers before them. These festive political gatherings held in plaza parking lots mark the launch of local campaigns in the contests for Brampton’s five federal seats. The events are a unique expression of community unity and partisan politics. On August 29, it was Conservative Brampton East candidate Naval Bajaj’s turn to launch his campaign. Against a backdrop made of election signs held together by tape, a selection of former and current conservatives greeted those gathered under the late summer heat. They told assembled supporters that Bajaj was the man to move the riding of Brampton East forward in Canada’s 44th Parliament. This is Bajaj’s second attempt to win a Brampton seat for the Conservatives. He also ran in 2015 against eventual winner Raj Grewal, who was removed from the Liberal caucus in 2018 after walking back a commitment to resign due to a gambling problem. In 2015, Bajaj only received around 10,000 votes compared to more than 23,000 cast for Grewal, in what proved to be a resounding Liberal sweep of Brampton and Mississauga under the party’s new leader at the time, Justin Trudeau. He was unsuccessful in his bid to secure a Progressive Conservative nomination ahead of 2018’s provincial election. He now says he is ready to represent the riding he lives in on Parliament Hill, where he feels the Liberal Party has had, and squandered, its chance to rule. “Brampton East is my home riding,” he tells The Pointer at his launch. “I have been living in Brampton [for] more than a decade and I faced the same challenges, my family faced the same challenges that everybody else in Brampton is facing. It is important that we address these issues.” Bajaj has a background in business and commerce. His bachelor's degree, like many political hopefuls, was in law before he began studying for a masters in engineering and then moved onto business administration instead. According to a profile in the Canadian Immigrant, his business background includes working as a consultant for 7-Eleven. Bajaj helped advise the corporation on how to grow its operations in Canada. Asked about his background, Bajaj keeps it simple. “I have been most in the retail industry”. The Brampton East candidate’s track record on international business relations between Canada and India is a key area of experience his campaign is keen to highlight. He is the former president of the Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce (ICCC) and the experience gained negotiating relationships between businesses in India and Canada could help reap rewards for his riding, where 56 percent of all immigrants were born in the sub-continent’s largest country, whose almost 1.4 billion residents represent the import and export potential of future commercial relationships between the two countries. Bajaj’s campaign website boasts that he secured the ICCC’s headquarters, a building in Toronto, when he was president, an achievement that could translate to future investments in Brampton as well. His philanthropy is also not exclusive to his home city, having raised funds for Toronto General Hospital and Scarborough General, along with Brampton Civic. “I am hard-pressed to think of one country where our relationship today is better than it was six years ago and no more can that be the case than with Canada-India relations,” John Baird, former Conservative minister of foreign affairs who has been attending candidate events across the GTA, told supporters at Bajaj’s launch. “We had a strong, great relationship with Prime Minister Modi and the Government of India… That’s why we need Naval, so we can get along better with India.” The Conservative star power in attendance was an indication the party thinks the riding is winnable. Liberal incumbent Maninder Sidhu performed poorly in his first two years as an MP, failing to advocate effectively for his riding after his nomination in 2019 raised questions about how the unknown candidate secured his name on the ballot with no experience in public office and very little indication of any work done in the community. The NDP nominated a strong candidate in the riding as well, Gail Bannister-Clarke, well known for her broad experience in education. His international experience is something Bajaj says he wants to bring to Ottawa. The candidate stresses his commitment is to Brampton, but he also wants to be included in key policy conversations about international relations and trade to benefit all Canadians, if he wins on September 20. “You wear many hats when you're a member of parliament, local is the priority but at the same time you’re working on the federal policy,” he says. “As a member of parliament, one of your key roles is to work on the federal policy… you need to work on the global trade, there is global relations. At the end of the day, whatever is needed for the Canadians, you need to work on that.” In every riding, it is these local issues that matter the most. Party leaders and the cabinet, backed by an army of civil servants, are tasked with the intricacies of foreign affairs, while individual members of parliament bring a local lens. Housing, local immigration priorities or public transit fall under the care of individual representatives. “Brampton needs good infrastructure, we need to work more on infrastructure, we need to get more and more funding for the Brampton infrastructure,” Bajaj says, referencing his party’s general talking points about the rising cost of living. The City of Brampton is pushing a very specific list of projects. City Hall wants an $850 million commitment to extend the Hurontario LRT north into downtown, $250 million for a rapid transit route along Queen Street, $75 million to electrify a bus storage garage and $42.2 million for enhanced active transportation networks to get people out of their cars. Bajaj is vague on the details of how he will deliver on these demands but says that he will do “whatever” it takes to secure “as much funding as possible” for Brampton. As he knocks on doors in Brampton East, hoping to win in a riding the Conservatives finished third in last time, he is offering a pragmatic pledge. He does not promise to change the world overnight, but will advocate for an area he believes, like many of his fellow constituents, is being left behind. “It’s not that the solution is going to be [in] the first 100 days, I cannot say that, but at least [I will be] laying [Brampton’s needs] on the table,” he says. “[I will] work with honourable Erin O’Toole, the prime minister, to make sure... we are ready to deliver all the promises that are being made.” Email: isaac.callan@thepointer.com"
"2021-09-11","Full text: DAWSON CREEK, B.C. - A federal all-candidates debate in northeastern British Columbia was cancelled due to concerns about the safety of candidates and the public. The debate hosted by the Dawson Creek and District Chamber of Commerce was scheduled for Tuesday night, but officials decided being able to host a safe and orderly meeting was too risky. Chamber executive director Kathleen Connolly says a series of threats to community leaders, recent arrests at city hall over COVID-19 protocols and the likelihood of pandemic issues overtaking the meeting all contributed to the decision to cancel. She says the seven candidates contesting the riding of Prince George-Peace River-Northern Rockies have been invited instead to post online campaign videos. Connolly says the Dawson Creek area has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccine rates in the province and the community has been engulfed in a debate over how vaccine cards might affect the business community. She says the decision to cancel the gathering is disappointing since the chamber has been hosting all-candidates debates for municipal, provincial and federal elections for more than 75 years in Dawson Creek. ""There have been threats to our MLA (Mike Bernier),"" Connolly said. ""There have been threats to our elected officials within the community. We had folks arrested and removed from city hall last week. We've just seen sort of an escalation of violent behaviours."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 8, 2021.

"2021-09-11","Full text: Tejinder Singh knows the winding cul de sacs of Brampton better than most. The real estate agent has been showing houses to hopeful first-time homebuyers for years, working to help support her Brampton family. As the election campaign nears its conclusion, Singh is experiencing her city in a new way. The NDP candidate for Brampton South is navigating the city’s streets, knocking on doors, trying to convince those who answer that she deserves a chance September 20, after decades of poor returns for the city under the Liberals and Conservatives. Liberal incumbent Sonia Sidhu is contesting Brampton South, alongside Ramandeep Brar for the Conservative Party of Canada. Nicholas Craniotis is on the ballot for the People’s Party of Canada, while the Greens failed to nominate a candidate for the riding. It’s Singh’s first time running for any political position. She says the decision was spurred, at least in part, by the NDP’s 2021 platform promises to introduce universal dental treatment and pharmacare across Canada. “I am political in my own house,” she jokes, speaking with The Pointer. “I run my own house as my political office. My kids, you will hear from them stories if you wanted to, that’s my own office.” Singh’s children are a big factor behind her key concerns. One of them still lives at home and is proof of how hard it can be for younger residents to step onto Peel’s broken housing ladder. The average home in Brampton during August sold for $1.06 million, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, above the Peel average of $1.04 million. Supercharged prices, not helped by the pandemic, have exacerbated a crisis across the region, where 80 percent of residents cannot afford to rent or buy. “I have been door-knocking and all I find is adult children living with their parents, and I also have an adult child living with us, and you know, it’s not easy for them,” Singh says. “I take out first-time homebuyers, where they’re ready to buy, they have the money and they’re disappointed because bidding wars are taking place [making the houses] way out of their reach. And so at that point, they really don’t have any options [apart from] to either rent or move to another city and I want to keep our professionals here. I want to make it so that professionals are here, they’re going to be the next generation to grow Brampton.” Alongside her job as a real estate agent, Singh is studying for her second undergraduate degree. Her first was from the University of Toronto, and she’s now working toward another from Ryerson University in public health. She might eventually work in healthcare if she fails to win a seat in Ottawa. “I want to press on social issues and I want to bring change to where it is needed,” she says. The NDP has promised to introduce free prescription drugs and dental care for every Canadian if the party forms the next government. Better drug treatments and access to universal medicine would go a long way to reversing Brampton’s pandemic hotspot designation, she says. The national promise is part of the party’s 2021 platform. Critics have said free dental care would be next to impossible in the face of provincial dental associations that are powerful and well funded, in the event of a potential future battle over the current private model. In Brampton, where many essential frontline workers are not offered additional dental insurance coverage with their jobs, Singh says it is a key issue. She says some residents are unable to retire or get stuck in jobs that don’t open new opportunities, because workers fear losing dental or other health benefits. Temporary workers in the gig economy, including delivery drivers for companies like Uber, toil without benefits, an issue also seen at many fulfilment centres, which are common in Brampton. Not making workers dependent on employment that puts them at risk during a public health situation such as a pandemic, would go a long way toward mitigating risks faced by many Brampton residents during the ongoing pandemic. Singh says it is the most important issue in Brampton South. “Locally, most workers, they’re worried,” she says. “For them, [it is also] the benefits they may lose with their job: dental care, pharmacare. That’s what Jagmeet Singh and we (the NDP) are wanting to push forward, to get that for the workers or people who cannot work anymore.”"

"2021-09-11","Full text: Secondary school students in the Thames Valley District School Board will not be required to take final examinations in any subjects over the next year. During a special board meeting on Tuesday night, Aug. 31, managers reviewed how schools would be operating this year, at least for now. The board is expecting about 95 percent of children to return to in-person learning in classrooms, while about five percent will continue to study remotely via the Internet. New student Trustee Harin Satheeskumar of London asked what examinations would look like for secondary students. Student Achievement Trustee Christine Giannacopoulos said the modified semester system being used for courses this week would result in a mark based entirely on work completed during each term. No formal final exams would be held, she said. Last year, secondary schools operated using “quadmesters,” with students taking two courses, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, for 10 weeks at a time. This year, Education Director Mark Fisher said, high schools would return to a two-term year, with up to four courses studied per term. The change was based on student and family concerns about the pace and intensiveness of the quadmester system, he said. However, the semesters wouldn’t revert completely to the system used before the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Fisher said instead, students would study two courses in one week, and the other two the next week, and so on for 20 weeks. A student would, during a single day, receive 150 instructional minutes in the morning, break for lunch, and then have 150 minutes in the second course in the afternoon. The new system was an attempt to continue to limit contacts between students of different “cohorts” to reduce potential transmission of the virus through a school, he said. All teachers, he noted, were being required to maintain a “digital platform” in case of virus developments leading to a return to full remote learning for all children, he added. Mr. Fisher said that in schools, children would be allowed again to use “common spaces” such as computer rooms, lockers and libraries that had been closed last year. Clubs, sports teams and other extra-curricular activities “may resume with some restrictions. This is an evolving topic.” The return to activities that had been forbidden last year would be intentionally gradual, he continued. Excursions to such places as outdoor learning centres could resume, as long as supervised at all times by TVDSB staff. School nutrition programs (healthy breakfasts and snacks) would resume, he said, but not special food events such as pizza days. Children would have to bring their own lunches. Lunch food would not be sold in schools. Cooperative education placements could resume, if the students involved were fully vaccinated and could follow all required health and safety protocols while in a workplace, he stated. Music classes could resume, but singing and wind instruments could only be played indoors if physical distancing could be maintained. The same applied to the use of gymnasiums, weight rooms and other school equipment. Childcare centres and before- and after-school programs could resume, Mr. Fisher said. Community rentals of school spaces would be allowed if public health guidelines were followed. Parents would receive a new “daily screener” checklist for children. Staff or children with any COVID-19 symptom, or otherwise ill, must not come to school. The Ontario Ministry of Education was requiring face masking for all children in Grades 1 through 12, and adult learners. Trustees, he noted, had required face masks be used in kindergartens as well, and that policy continued unless a child was granted a medical examination. Staff members would receive medical-grade face masks and other personal protective equipment as needed for their jobs. Eye protection would be required if working with an unmasked student. When students were deaf or hard of hearing, clear face masks would be provided to staff. All unnecessary furniture had been removed from classrooms to allow desks to be distanced from each other as much as possible, Mr. Fisher stated. Children wouldn’t be required to stay within their cohorts while outdoors, but recesses and breaks would be staggered to discourage congregation between cohorts. Children could eat together indoors or outdoors, but only if two metres distance could be maintained between children of different cohorts. Within the cohorts, children would be separated as much as possible. All staff, visitors and trustees much be vaccinated to enter any school board property, he said. The board’s administration was working on a system involving proof of vaccination. Mr. Fisher said staff members who chose not to be vaccinated would be required to participate in an immunization education session, and would have to be tested weekly for COVID-19 on their own time. Any visitor to a school, in addition to being vaccinated, must wear a medical-grade mask while indoors, provided by the school if necessary. Board Chairman and London Trustee Lori-Anne Pizzolato asked what the board’s plan was to assess each child’s learning from the last year after returning to the classroom. Mr. Fisher said such assessments were being made a priority. They had always been necessary, but the educational experience for each child over the last 18 months of the pandemic had been highly variable, so they were even more important now. Teachers were expected to conduct “diagnostic assessments of student needs” and provide extra help where needed, he added. Oxford Trustee Barb Yeoman, noting the requirement for unvaccinated staff to be tested weekly, asked, “Is it own their own dime?” Mr. Fisher said the board was currently obligated by the Ontario Ministry of Health to provide such tests to unvaccinated staff. London Trustee Corrine Rahman asked if schools would be used for polling stations in the Sept. 20 federal election, as they had in the past. Associate Director Jeff Pratt said the board had been working closely with Elections Canada on that subject. Schools had typically been used for voting in past federal and provincial elections, he said, but the board was trying to reduce the number of visitors to them. As a result, only eight schools would be used for polling stations during this election. For those that were, each polling station would have to have an exterior entrance and exit separate to those used by children, and a washroom would be designated for use by election officials only.

"2021-09-11","Full text: For anyone watching the terrifying scenes south of the border over recent days, first in and around Louisiana and then across parts of New York and New Jersey, the devastating impact of climate change on underfunded cities hit home with resounding effect. Municipal and state leaders repeatedly spoke of the lives lost, people trapped in basement apartments where they drowned and others who were swept into stormwater sewers overpowered by the raging waters. The unfolding story is one of cities that simply are not equipped to handle the looming threat of climate change, and nowhere in Canada is this more evident than Mississauga. The city has been ravaged by massive storms and flooding in recent years, its aging infrastructure in desperate need of an overhaul. Meanwhile, other badly needed infrastructure to keep up with its exploding population and future proof the city against the impacts of our climate reality, has not come online fast enough to make Mississauga a destination for residents who want to live in the type of modern environment younger generations now demand. The Hurontario LRT is part of that future and has become synonymous with the modernization of a transit system that in the past was an afterthought amid Mississauga’s sprawling ‘80s and ‘90s trajectory. Time and again it is rolled out as an example of how the city is finally gliding toward a truly urban future. The project itself has been on the table for almost a decade. It was officially confirmed in 2014 and will enter service in 2024. Thanks to the transit route, there has been a tangible sense of excitement around Mississauga’s growth. Developers have flocked to build condos and office towers along Hurontario Street, away from the unsustainable subdivisions of the past, while politicians continue to laud the line’s potential. It’s a symbol of progress, but the eye-catching project is also papering over the cracks. Much of Mississauga’s infrastructure was built at the tail end of the last century and is now in an increasingly desperate state of disrepair. Attempts to build other transformative projects to complement the Hurontario LRT, and unlock its potential within a rapid transit network, have met with mixed success. The list of aging assets Mississauga owns is enormous and includes roughly 60 percent of all infrastructure located within the city’s boundaries. This portfolio features: $4.5 billion worth of stormwater assets, $2.9 billion in roads, $1.9 billion in buildings and $935 million worth of bridges."
"2021-09-11","Full text: There are a few musts that make democracy work. Democracy must be participatory and it must encourage rigorous dialogue, said Sarah Bennett, People’s Party of Canada (PPC) candidate for Kootenay-Columbia. But politics also must be motivated by solid, transparent values, which is why she so strongly supports the PPC and its precepts. On Sept. 20 Bennett will be adding her name to the ballot list as a candidate for the PPC, but she is more than party platforms. Bennett said she “stands for the freedoms outlined in the Canadian charter and is staunchly opposed to any form of health apartheid or pervasive digital identity mandate.” More citizen engagement is needed in the political process, Bennett noted, to “increase the breadth of dialogue, to spread awareness of the threat to our liberties and to defend the lifestyle Kootenay folk love so much.” She has a strong sense of civic duty. In 2005 in Invermere she ran for town council and served one term as councillor. “(I have) always been an advocate for responsible governance that balances fiscal, social, environmental priorities, adding that she believed in sovereignty at both the national and individual levels. As a self-taught brand developer, Bennett has been self-employed for the last 20 years. But her passion for politics began in high school as co-head of the political affairs club at Havergal College in Toronto. Bennett had the opportunity to meet several premiers and a prime minister at an early age, and it helped her realize politicians are only human. Later on Bennett went to McGill University and graduated with a BA in political science, eventually migrating from east to the west and to the Columbia Valley in 2002 with a year spent at Panorama Resort post university. “Kootenay-Columbia is a stunning part of Canada, a place where so many like-minded people live and enjoy the freedom of nature and the solace of backcountry excursions,” she said.

"2021-09-10","Full text: SDSG – Ottawa-based lawyer David Anber says the biggest issue facing voters this election is personal liberty and freedoms. Anber, 40, is the People’s Party of Canada candidate in Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry. While he does not live in the riding, Anber said he believed he had a good grasp of the issues in the area as he has practiced law in the area for over a decade. Anber recently joined the PPC, having quit the Conservative Party of Canada over that party’s stance on the COVID-19 pandemic. “I’ve been very dismayed as to the direction that all the main parties have been going on things like civil liberties,” Anber explained. “The most recent example of this is the issue about vaccine passports. The idea that anyone other than the individual should be making the decision as to whether or not they take that vaccine – to me – is such a radical idea.” Anber said that he thought that vaccines are great, and he was not against vaccines calling the high uptake in vaccinations “a good thing.” “The PPC is the only party that seems to be taking a stand for basic civil liberties,” Anber said. While Anber called the COVID-19 virus a serious health issue, he said that the pandemic is “sometimes just as dangerous to exaggerate. The seriousness of COVID at any given time it’s a fraction of a percent of people who have it in Canada.” Returning to some form of normal – after pandemic related lock-downs devastated businesses and what he said are the lasting social effects on adults and children – is a priority for Anber. “Say what you want, about the difference between the flu and COVID, with vaccine uptake what it is right now it’s hard to make the case that COVID is that much of a threat to us,” he said. “Okay. I know that some people want to make that case but the science doesn’t support that now.” Anber has worked in the region as a lawyer for several years, and said he has been bringing himself up-to-date on some of the local issues. “I don’t profess to be an expert on everything, and I think there’s a lot for me to learn still, but I have been doing my homework,” he said. “If a constituent were to bring one up that I haven’t thought of, I will certainly commit to looking at it through the lens of the principles that are important to me in the PPC right now.” Speaking to party leadership, Anber said that most leaders have grand ideas but when challenged, change their tune to less controversial ideas. “I like that about [PPC leader] Maxime Bernier that he sticks to principles and is articulate why he’s fixed on those principles,” he said. When asked about the PPC party platform plank that would phase out Canada’s Supply Management system of quotas for dairy, chicken, and egg farms, Anber said that he had an open mind about fine-tuning his party’s plan. “Not just going to a pure free market approach, but the starting point is that the free market should decide and then we go from there,” he said. Looking forward to election day, Anber said he was going to campaign in the riding in and around his legal practice, and he planned to open his office in Cornwall in the coming week.

"2021-09-10","Full text: Local musician and songwriter Larry Pegg wants Canadians to consider offering up their vote in the upcoming election to youth. He says, “This election, more than ever before, be a proxy for young people who cannot yet vote.” Voting by proxy is a way of including minors, who are not yet legally given a vote, in the democratic process that will guide the future of our planet. When Larry lost his 21-year-old daughter Kelly Anne to suicide in December of 2007, he became all too aware of how young people suffer from climate despair. His daughter, like many young people, suffered from the impression that planet earth, its climate and inhabitants, are doomed due to lack of respect for the environment. In 2019, we saw young people all over the world rise up at Climate Marches. This movement continues today, as many of the people at the forefront of environmental activism are youth. But still other youth feel hopeless and voiceless in the face of climate change. Larry says, “Given the importance of this election as it pertains to climate action and its direct relationship to eco-anxiety affecting millions of young people today, I would like to reinforce this important message and get it out across Canada to help voters know how important this issue is to those who cannot vote.” Regardless of what mature voters believe, Larry hopes they will consider what youth believe: the political decisions we make now will shape the world that young people inherit. He says, “Mature voters can become a proxy vote for young people. By mature I mean those in retirement, or those close to the end of their long, relatively safe and comfortable lives. Even those with a terminal illness, or undecided or confused voters. It can even mean first time voters who are overwhelmed by the complexity of the platforms. What I’m talking about is a revolutionary way to engage people in democracy. We pivoted for Covid. We can pivot for our children’s future too.” To Larry, this election cycle will mark a pivotal moment for, “climate action or climate inaction, a moment for the history books.”"

"2021-09-10","Full text: SDSG – Conservative Party of Canada candidate Eric Duncan has been ready for months for an upcoming election. But he still thinks that the August 15 election call was unnecessary. In fact, it is one of his biggest issues this vote, and one he hears resonating when he is out campaigning. “The unnecessary election, and the fact that it costs $600 million dollars. People are very frustrated and see this election is unnecessary,” Duncan told The Leader. “I think it’s going to be an issue over the course of the campaign.” Duncan explained that the election is an opportunity to see who has the best economic plan for the post-pandemic recovery, and he feels his party has it. “I think about getting businesses re-opened, to be able to hire workers, getting people going to businesses to eat out, we have a plan,” he said. “We can get the economy firing up, which is a big issue locally and nationally as well.” Some of the issues he campaigned on in 2019 are still top-of-mind for him, but were sidelined because of the pandemic. This includes working on St. Lawrence River water levels, which Duncan said he had made some by-partisan advancements in the last term, and he wants to continue working on it. “I work with Conservative, Liberal, and NDP MPs that are along the Great Lakes. Having been there for two years and working across the aisle, I have a very good sense of what we need to do,” he said. “[Water levels] impact everybody. It’s not an easy undertaking. There are a bunch of the silos between [government ]departments. I’ve got a good handle and I’d like to go Full Throttle ahead to try to make progress on the water level issue.” He added that the issues are both from an environmental perspective, and also the economic aspect and how water levels affect businesses that rely on the St. Lawrence River. Duncan identified the housing cost issues for both buying and renting homes in the region saying that his party’s pledge to build one-million homes in three years will help. “We’ve committed to building a million homes over three years and that is in the private sector and getting supply of new homes being built in the country,” Duncan said. He went on to say that his party will work with provinces and municipalities to cut red tape. “Conservatives have a very good reputation for that,” Duncan said. “Building faster, increasing supply is the single biggest way to improve options and to make housing prices more affordable.” He added that his party will provide incentives to build and create rental units as well. Scrapping the Liberal Party’s $10 per day child care plan, Duncan said that his party’s plan of a 75 per cent tax credit for parents was the better way of providing child care. Before the August 15 election call, Ontario had not yet agreed to the federal government’s plan. “It’s going to be instant relief for people right off the bat,” he said. “Even with all the [Liberal] announcements, they admitted they are three-to-four years away from those childcare spaces. People getting that service need it now,” Duncan explained. “Our plan comes into effect immediately, and it is flexible.” Duncan said that a Conservative government would change the childcare expense option from a non-refundable, to a refundable tax credit. And reimbursement for childcare would be monthly, not yearly, so families would not have to wait long for a refund. “This is going to be thousands of dollars more in their pockets and make a massive difference right away,” Duncan said adding that home-based daycare providers would be allowed under his party’s plan if elected. When asked why he should be voted in for another term in office, Duncan said, “I love what I do, and I love the opportunity to represent our community and being out there. I enjoy what I do and I think I have a pretty good grasp of both local and National issues, and the pulse of our community.” Duncan was first elected to North Dundas council in 2006 as an 18 year old candidate. He was elected mayor of that township in 2010 and served two terms in that position. Duncan also served two consecutive terms as SDG Counties warden, and was the former parliamentary assistant to Stormont-Dundas-Glengarry MP Guy Lauzon. Lauzon retired in 2019 and Duncan succeeded him in office. He received 53.9 per cent of the popular vote in the riding in 2019.

"2021-09-10","Full text: SDSG – Getting the word out about climate change is at the heart of the local Green Party of Canada’s candidate in Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry. Last month, the local riding association nominated Dr. Jeanie Warnock as their candidate in the September 20 federal election. A resident of the Moose Creek area of the riding, this is not her first foray into politics. In 2008 she ran for the Greens in the neighbouring riding of Leeds-Grenville. She has a PHD in English from the University of Ottawa and was a lecturer at the school. She now works on her hobby farm and raises her 10 year old son with her partner. “I mean if you follow the science we are definitely facing a climate emergency and I felt that information has to get out,” she told The Leader. “The more people hear about it, the more they hear about the solutions, the way we can solve the problems, the more I hope they can support change.” Warnock explained that the Green Party platform isn’t about making frightening changes to how things are. “We just have to sort of shift some of our priorities and move towards a cleaner way of living,” she said. Outside of environmental concerns, Warnock said there are two local issues she wanted to highlight – access to mental health for youth and rural areas, and engagement with First Nations communities. “You have children and youth that mental health is a big issue across the country, but I think it’s an even bigger issue in rural areas because there’s so little funding for it,” she explained. “We live in a rural community and are so much more isolated. It’s so much harder to get services, even for the elderly.” Warnock said the challenge for farmers especially is they are self-employed and don’t have access to private insurance to assist, but earn too much to qualify for government programs to access mental health supports. Engagement with the local First Nations community in Akwesasne is another local priority for the Green Party candidate. Dealing with the Cornwall waterfront development lands is an opportunity according to Warnock, to build stronger ties with Akwesasne. “A lot of those lands are still owned or leased from the federal government,” she explained. “So that really gives use an opportunity now that our society is feeling more strongly towards reconciliation, that we should make reparations towards First Nations. It’s an example of how we can work together.” Warnock said on the campaign trail she will be emphasizing the needlessness of having the election now. “I truly hope the voters reprimand Justin Trudeau for calling this unnecessary election,” she said. “He had a minority but he hasn’t been opposed in Parliament by any major party.” She opined that the money being spent on an election could have been better directed into pandemic recovery or environmental conservation programs. For the local campaign, Warnock said she is focused on running an authentic campaign while trying to communicate the party’s platform. “I believe we have to address the climate crisis for the sake of our children and that will carry me forward,” she said. “Hopefully I’ll be able to convey the authenticity of that message in contrast with a person who’s basically been a professional politician for his whole life.” She questioned if incumbent MP Eric Duncan addressed serious issues during his term in office. “So it’s great of Mr. Duncan to set up tax clinics for seniors, and he mails me out a calendar every year I use to plan ahead. But I do not think he is actually doing anything on serious issues.” Warnock said it is important for an MP to reach out to people in the community and engage with a different range of people. “I would be doing more of that if elected,” she said. The local Green Party candidate returned to the environmental message of the party platform to close out her interview. “We really have to do something to try to slow climate change,” she said. “When I first ran 13 years ago, we didn’t have nearly as much data and [scientists] were anticipating what could happen 10 years later, 15 years later. We’re now seeing what is happening with heat waves like we’ve had.” Election candidate profile note The Leader contacted the SDSG Liberal and NDP riding associations to arrange interviews with their respective candidates.

All three communities hosted Archibald at separate, preplanned meet and greet events, singing honour songs, presenting her with gifts, and discussing local issues. Archibald is very active on social media and provides regular updates, including thanking each band individually for their hospitality. The National Chief’s first visit was to the Chippewa’s of Nawash (Neyaashiinigmiing), where she was greeted by their new chief, Veronica “Cha Cha” Smith, who arranged a meet and greet with her new council and members of the community. “This was my second visit to their powwow grounds at Cape Croker Park, where I visited in 2019, when they honoured Butch Elliott. It was good to see some familiar faces, including John Borrows, former Chief Greg Nadjiwon and Geewadin Elliott. The event started with an honour song from the community women’s drum group. I was humbled to receive an eagle feather from the Chief and council as well.” “We then went to the lighthouse where we offered tobacco and prayed for the land and waters. Such a beautiful and powerful way to start my journey,” she added. The tour then travelled down the road to the Saugeen First Nation, where Chief Lester Anaquot greeted them. He also held an outdoor event to welcome the new National Chief. Archibald said she spoke about her priorities as National Chief and heard about community priorities and concerns from the chief, council, and community members. “There was also a beautiful honour song followed by lunch and quick tour of the community. We took a drive to the south end of Sauble Beach, located on their territory and they explained that leasing their lots to cottagers was a source of income to members and the community.” The final stop on this leg of Archibald’s national tour was Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation. “Chief Jason Henry (who is on leave while he runs in the federal election) gave me a tour of the community, Archibald said in a post on social media. “After driving through the old Ipperwash base, now the Stoney Point community, we stopped at the Dudley George memorial. From there we went to the community beach where we ran into Chief Henry’s dad and family.” She spoke about her trip to see the unique rock formations on the beach and the land at Kettle Point. “The legend is that they were Thunderbird eggs,” she said. The day ended with a “much delayed Indigenous Solidarity Day/Life Celebration BBQ where Archibald me council members, including Acting Chief Liz Thunder, and “caught one of the famous KSP sunsets.” On Aug. 31, 2021, Archibald will formally release and launch the Assembly of First Nations’ Federal Election document titled “The Healing Path Forward: 2021 Federal Priorities for Strengthening and Rebuilding First Nations”"

A councillor for the Town of Trenton, he was employed as an auto mechanic for more than three decades, was a volunteer with the Trenton Volunteer Fire Department for approximately 40 years (he was also employed with the New Glasgow Volunteer Fire Department), and he enjoyed a stint in the Canadian Armed Forces. A school bus driver for Chignecto Central schools, Cotter has been recognized for his volunteer work in the community, assisting the Trenton Legion through its Chase the Ace program, among other activities. He says the Conservatives recruited him to become a candidate in this federal election. The Journal recently spoke with Cotter about the campaign and his candidacy. What are your top priorities and why do you think your party is the best choice at this time? “We all know the importance of health. Conservatives want to increase the funding to the province [health transfers] from three per cent to six per cent. That’s one issue amongst a lot of others, like getting people back to work. Here in Pictou County, we had Trenton Works for many, many years. That’s pretty well flattened out now, and we have to turn around and come up with something that will take its place. With COVID, we’ve lost an awful lot of jobs, because people can’t get out to work, which is not a good thing all the way around. Granted, Atlantic Canada is one of the safest places in North America because we weren’t afraid to shut everything down and keep our people safe.” What are you hearing from voters? “We’re late getting into the game. We’re going out and knocking on doors. We’ve been trying to touch base. The riding is so big. But a lot of the concerns are work and healthcare. Healthcare is one of the biggest problems and, granted, it is a provincial issue. Some people understand that and some people don’t. So, we try to turn around and get through funding so the province can turn around and look after them. “I [consider] myself to be a blue-collar worker. I know what it’s like to work in hard times. My main priority is serving the people of Central Nova and, hopefully, come election day, we’ll be successful. I know I have a lot to learn, and we will do our best, if successful.” Why are you running in this election? “I was asked by the party. “It was always way in the back of my mind. I thought maybe someday. In 1942, my grandfather came back from overseas. He was injured in the war. He ended up being the mayor of Trenton for one term. So, ironically, it’s the place where I continue on with my political career. I’m still young at heart, and so we keep on doing what we can.” Subject: Fires"

"2021-09-10","Full text: The federal Conservative Party is distancing itself from a controversial firearms lobby group to dispel attacks from the Liberals painting it as a party that strikes deals with gun lobbyists. It even amended party policy to say that, if elected, a Conservative government would keep the Liberal gun restrictions and complete a review of those rules. Canada’s National Firearms Association (NFA) is an advocacy group representing firearms owners and is registered as a third party with Elections Canada. In a recent video, NFA president Sheldon Clare said the association has a “pretty solid relationship” with the Conservative government and hopes that will continue on Sept. 21, calling on viewers to “get these guys out of opposition and into government.” The NFA is active on Facebook and has been running attack ads primarily geared at voters in Ontario and Alberta. Canada’s National Observer is mining Facebook’s ad library, revealing these ads and trends. Although the Conservative Party is distancing itself from the NFA and has softened its position on gun restrictions, the NFA is not concerned about Erin O’Toole’s new stance and runs ads taking aim at Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. The ultimate goal of the NFA’s political ads and involvement is to see the Liberals removed from power and replaced by, at the very least, a Conservative minority, Sheldon Clare, president of the NFA, told Canada’s National Observer. A recent ad reads, “Trudeau has to go.” According to Clare, these cartoon-style ads seem to be “one of our most effective operational efforts” and said there will likely be more in the near future. Strategies with negative messages — like those the NFA has been using — tend to be very effective, said Noah Schwartz, an assistant professor of political science at Concordia University and author of Guns in the North: Social Identity and Firearms Advocacy in Canada."

"2021-09-09","Full text: Former Liberal MP joins Calgary mayoralty race CALGARY - Former member of Parliament Kent Hehr is throwing his hat in the ring to become Calgary's new mayor. Hehr has become the 28th candidate seeking to replace longtime Mayor Naheed Nenshi, who announced earlier this year he did not want to seek re-election. Hehr served two terms as a legislature member for the Liberals in 2015. He then successfully ran for the federal Liberals in the riding of Calgary Centre before he was defeated in 2019. On Tuesday, Hehr said that if elected mayor on Oct. 28, he will work to maintain a positive relationship with both the United Conservative Party government of Premier Jason Kenney and with the federal government in Ottawa. Hehr said it's essential to ""get off on the right foot"" with both levels of government to represent Calgary properly. ""You have to take that objective lens and you have to work with people and that's what I've done each and every day,"" Hehr said outside his Calgary law firm. ""People know me as almost non-partisan Kent. And that's what I'm actually excited about. Going back to city hall, you don't have labels. You just work on good public policy."" Hehr also entered the mayoralty race in 2010 but withdrew to support Nenshi. Among the other 27 candidates are city councillors Jeromy Farkas, Jeff Davison and Jyoti Gondek. Hehr said he was encouraged by voters to seek the mayor's chair. ""They told me that they didn't see a progressive in the race ... someone who had the experience I did — eight years at the provincial legislature, four in Ottawa — knowing how those different levels of government work and ensuring that we can partner with them,"" he said. In 2018, Hehr left Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet over allegations that he made sexually inappropriate comments to one woman and touched another inappropriately. He said at the time that he had no memory of the events, and an investigation deemed any sexual contact incidental. ""Distance and time has put perspective on that issue that allows me to move forward on this campaign and to ensure that we are creating a city that is safe for everyone,"" Hehr said.

"2021-09-09","Full text: Grey County met in special session recently and chose to pause the planned re-build of Grey Gables. The committee of the whole meeting saw the motion by an Owen Sound councillor approved. It will now head back to a County Council session for final adoption. Southgate’s Mayor John Woodbury and Deputy-Mayor Deputy-Mayor Brian Milne supported putting the Grey Gables project on hold. At Southgate Council last week, Mayor Woodbury commented on the issue “which has stirred up a few people.” “It was a financial decision,” he said. “I think that was a wise move, a financially-wise move.” Deputy-Mayor Milne rejected “chatter” of those who have said that the decision pointed to the County moving again to close the facility. “That’s absolutely not true,” he said. Mayor Woodbury agreed, saying there was “a lot of determination” on County Council to keep Grey Gables open. The road has been rocky to the renewal of county care homes outside Owen Sound. First, a consultant’s report about five years ago recommended working on both homes, a direction which county council set aside to endorse closing the 66-bed Grey Gables as a county home and expanding Rockwood Terrace. The Rockwood Terrace building replacement is needed before 2025 in order to upgrade to required standards. It is a complete new build. Grey Gables was saved from the planned closure after public rallies, intervention from former wardens and a municipal election in which many lost their seats who had voted to close Grey Gables. A price estimate of $400,000, more than 40 percent over previous estimates led to the renewed questions about the future of the Markdale county long-term care home. And while the COW vote to “pause” was a bit more ambiguous, area residents still took to social media to voice their fears additional beds that had been approved by the province might be lost. County CAO Kim Wingrove said on that the project manager at the ministry of Long Term Care said they could discuss extending the completion date to the re-build. Switching to a proposal for an addition at Grey Gables rather than a new build is possible, she said, but would mean a whole new application and approval process. Deputy-Warden Paul McQueen said he would want assurance in writing that the beds would still be there if the county waits before building. He said that he spoke to MPP Bill Walker and heard back that there would be no guarantees. Although the county council vote which saved Grey Gables did not foresee a new re-build in Markdale, that was the application that council eventually approved to be submitted. The two new 128-bed builds in Durham and Markdale were approved by the Ministry at the same time, and a single firm hired to manage the builds. That included looking for efficiencies from doing the projects at the same time, which would mainly be in the design not the construction stage, Mr. Rodrigues said. The estimate presented by Colliers Aug. 26 of $370,000 to $400,000 or more per bed. That is full project costs, including more than construction. Square footage of homes with the same number of beds can vary widely, Colliers said. The budget includes escalation up to the time of tender expected at the end of next year, as well as contingency. When vote time came Aug. 26 on the motion to pause, Grey Highlands Deputy-Mayor Aakash Desai voted in favour. Coun. Desai said that his concern was not the next election, but how incurring the debt load would impact county spending and the next generation. Council was presented with numbers showing how going forward would limit the amount of further debt the county could incur for infrastructure. Deputy-Warden Paul McQueen and the West Grey Mayor and Deputy-Mayor were among those opposed the motion. One councillor made the point that with the amount of population growth expected in the south east of the county, especially Southgate, on top of the overall greying of the population there was no doubt the beds were needed. County Coun. Tom Hutchinson asked for the impact in a more practical form of the increase in levy per household per year. In answer, total levy impacts at an assumed interest rate were stated, along with the number of households. Darrin Patey, who was prominent in the fight to Save Grey Gables, said on Facebook that he’s left wondering if the next step will be to bring back the idea of ditching a county-owned facility in Markdale. Questions posed by members of the “Save Grey Gables Again” Facebook group were plentiful as members looked for reasons for the vote, asking: - how is the $400,000 per bed estimate justified? - since beds are needed, why “pause” while costs continue to rise and when interest rates are low? - why was a complete new build of Grey Gables applied for in the first place and can that plan be switched? - if it is a complete new build, why is there no revenue projected from re-sale and re-purposing of the existing building? The thrust of the last battle, which united people in Durham and Grey Highlands was to “Save Grey Gables.” Darrin Patey, moderator of the page, now re-named Save Grey Gables Again, said that Grey County taxpayers were not asking for a relatively new building to be abandoned and replaced with a totally new build. He put the responsibility on county staff. “We, the people, never once asked for a new build.” At County Council, the $400,000 per bed figures was questioned by several members. Coun. Soever said that the development charges would not be charged, which could lower the cost per bed by $50,000. County Councillor Aakash Desai asked about the DCs and was told that the project is exempt from the charges. If Grey Gables doesn’t go ahead now, the cost would likely be higher later, the consultant said, in answer to a question from Coun. Scott Mackey. Coun. Soever also pointed out that the County owns the land, which could be worth $10k to $30k per bed in the price, he suggested. “I’m a little concerned that maybe we’re looking at the most pessimistic view of this, and that this cash flow model is designed to discourage council members from proceeding with Grey Gables.” He also asked if Mr. Rodrigues was familiar with the valuation for the existing long-term facility, for which the highest and best use would be as an assisted care home – for which it has earlier been valued at $3.9 million. The CAO said she didn’t think that was a significant part of Colliers valuation or budget discussion, and she had not presented it to the firm. Coun. Soever says the impact of that value is real in offsetting the debt. Campus of Care is how you make money, on the senior residential side, and dismissing that doesn’t mean doing the best job for taxpayers, he said. Warden Selwyn Hicks called Mr. Soever’s suggestion that figures were prepared to discourage the project a “pretty serious allegation” and asked Mr. Rodrigues to comment. The Colliers rep said that he had seen projects with donated land before. At $400k per bed, there are still choices to be made about where the county will invest. “In no means is $400,000 going to be the most pessimistic case to afford the biggest long term care redevelopment or home that’s out there,” Mr. Rodrigues said. He said he was asked to give county council more context that day about why the figure was reasonable, and that was his goal. He also added that in the range of projects supporting his estimate, there were some without DC s and some which do not have a large land value. If one project does not go ahead, CAO Kim Wingrove, said the pricing for the contract with Colliers could be discussed, as it was clearly two projects. Coun. Soevers said it was approved as a total amount of $899,000. Questioning the estimates, Deputy-Warden McQueen cited that $180,000 per bed was given as a benchmark from Sienna in 2016. He referred to the Southbridge project in Owen Sound by Graham in Owen Sound. The contractor told him in conversation recently that the company’s cost for that project is $175,000 per bed, the Deputy-Warden said, although he added that he would have to increase that today another 15 to 20 percent. It was a design-build project. Deputy-Mayor McQueen asked the consultant how that was possible. CAO Kim Wingrove jumped in to say that for a meaningful comparison a detailed budget would be needed. Mr. Rodrigues mentioned different factors to explain the difference. One of thes is increased costs from when the Owen Sound project was tendered to when the Grey County builds are expected. Another is size of building – whether it just meets the directives of the Ministry when it comes to size or providing something larger. Contingency is also part of the $400,000 estimate. Mr. Rodrigues said that the location (rural vs. urban) is taken into account. Coun. Shirley Keaveney said a LTC build going on in Meaford now has a cost of $195,000 per bed, though that is not all-inclusive.

Hislop is a local to Shaaunavon and decided to run for the PPC because he couldn’t bring himself to vote for a carbon tax any longer. “I’ve been a long-term Conservative supporter but their platform this year is something I just couldn’t vote for,” said Hislop. “Another 10 years of deficits and a carbon tax. Thinking of what this country is going to turn into if we keep going down this conservative line, for my children and everyone else’s children, and the vaccine and mask mandates, it’s been a real hardship on everyone’s children.” Hislop said that the government needs to start focusing on real issues like getting rid of carbon tax and balancing the budget. The PPC does have plans if elected to remove the carbon tax and remove all vaccine mandates and any Covid-19 restrictions that still exist. If elected Hislop plans to support farmers and oil field workers by removing the carbon tax and lowering taxes. The tax plan the PPC has put forward includes getting rid of the current tax brackets and having only two brackets: individuals earning between $15,000 and $100,000 will be taxed at a rate of 15 per cent, while those making above $100,000 will be at a rate of 25 per cent."

"2021-09-09","Full text: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals are feeling the heat in Election 2021 and it was the same story at the first Chatham-Kent-Leamington all-candidate’s meeting Sept 1. Held at the SOAR Innovation Hub in downtown Chatham, the event saw all five hopefuls prepared and ready to answer questions. Conservative incumbent Dave Epp, NDP candidate Dan Gelinas, Liberal hopeful Greg Hetherington, People’s Party of Canada candidate Liz Vallee and Green Party candidate Mark Vercouteren put forward their views as part of the panel. Each candidate was allowed a two-minute introduction, a two-minute closing statement, and all were given two minutes each to answer five questions on current issues. What their party will do about climate change was one of the hot button topics. According to the NDP’s Gelinas, a recent Angus Reid poll puts climate change as the most pressing issue Canadians are facing. However, Gelinas said the traditional parties aren’t doing anything to solve the problem, adding the Conservative party denies that climate change exists. “They are long on aspirations and short on details,” he explained, “with no restrictions on emissions.” And the Liberals are not any better, Gelinas noted, as Trudeau has handed out millions to “Big Oil” and gas without meeting any of Canada’s emission targets. Gelinas said the NDP would cut emissions by half and pour money into electric transit, which in turn would create thousands of good-paying jobs. Epp, the sitting MP, said the Conservatives have a “serious plan” to meet the Paris Accord emission benchmarks. They will also create a low carbon savings account – rather than a carbon tax – where individuals can direct the money to environmental issues as they see fit. Expanding the use of electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel are other goals, he said, adding the Conservatives will funnel $3 billion in incentives to the agriculture and forestry industries by 2030. According to Hetherington, climate change is the “biggest story of the century.” The Liberal candidate cited the fires in British Columbia and rising seas as evidence of the need for change. Hetherington said the Liberals plan on planting two billion trees, as well as aiming for net zero emissions by 2050 and a net zero electricity grid by 2035. “Unlike the Conservative party that doesn’t believe in climate change, the Liberal party does,” he said, “and we’ll take action to make sure this planet is safe for you and your grandchildren.” The Liberals have made significant investments in public transit recently, he noted, funding some 1,300 projects across the country. In her response, Vallee said she has faith in humanity, adding humans always find a way to overcome environmental challenges. “What we need to do is unleash people’s creativity” to come up with innovative solutions, Vallee said, noting Canada currently does not have adequate alternatives to fossil fuels. “We are not ready to move away from fossil fuels,” she said, adding Canadians don’t need the government “dictating” solutions because the people will “figure it out.” Vercouteren said Canada has all the green technologies it needs and that Canada just needs to build on and expand its programs. The use of electrical vehicles needs to be increased, he said, adding the electric transit infrastructure must be expanded. Mandating the use of electric vehicles by the federal government is something the Green Party would push for, Vercouteren said. Vercouteren said the pandemic has taught the lesson that many Canadians can work from home, if they have adequate Internet, thereby reducing the carbon footprint. Retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient and affordable is another sector the Greens would incentivize. Questions about innovation and the economy, affordable housing, childcare, and the rights of Canada’s Indigenous people against the backdrop of graves found at residential schools were also on the table. In his remarks, Epp criticized Trudeau for calling an unwanted, unnecessary election. “The majority of Canadians aren’t happy we are here tonight because the majority of Canadians don’t want an election,” he said, adding the timing was poor considering we’re in the middle of a fourth wave of the pandemic amidst the backdrop of bleak economy. In her address Vallee stressed that she’s a “completely different candidate” from a “completely different party.” Hetherington said he “loves the community of Chatham-Kent” and will do whatever he can to assist local constituents, adding he considers “good health care” to be the top issue. Although candidates were told not to make personal attacks and stick to issues, that’s not how it played out. Vallee was reminded midway not to use personal references, when she called Epp “Dave the Farmer” and Hetherington, “Greg the Radio Guy.” During her closing statement, Vallee veered back into personal attack territory when she unveiled a poster of Trudeau’s infamous blackface photograph emblazoned with the words “Greg Hetherington’s New Boss.” Organizer Andrea Colasanti, moderator of the event, said she was pleased with the outcome, adding all of the candidates were well spoken and prepared. The Chatham native, who now lives in Ottawa, received a grant through the non-partisan Equal Voice’s Daughters of the Vote to host the event in her home riding.

"2021-09-09","Full text: This federal election will have the highest number of self-identified Indigenous candidates seeking seats. According to a Canadian Press analysis, there are at least 77 Indigenous candidates, 15 more than the 62 that ran in 2019. However, Niigaan Sinclair, assistant professor of Native Studies at the University of Manitoba, is suspicious about that high number. “It’s also a lot of people who are claiming to be Indigenous when they weren’t claiming to be Indigenous two weeks ago… “They’re claiming to be Indigenous when the fact is a closer analysis would show that they don’t have a legitimate claim. We won’t find that out until well after the federal election, so it’s a question of whether they get voted in or not. But if people are claiming Indigenous identity, they better have credentials,” said Sinclair. Indigenous identity has become a hotly debated issue in the past few years, particularly with the rise of the “Eastern Métis,” a growing number of people in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces who claim Métis status. Even within the Métis Nation itself there is contention over the boundaries of the Métis homeland map. “The fact is that if you’re Indigenous to this country, you have obligations, you have responsibilities …. It’s not about who you claim, but who claims you,” said Sinclair. He questions the claim made by the People’s Party of Canada of having four Indigenous candidates. “(The People’s Party) is xenophobic. It’s the most anti-Indigenous policy of any of the platforms probably since John A. MacDonald. So it just tells you that people want to grip on to Indigenous identification because it will get them votes or get them support or make them look diverse,” said Sinclair. “I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that there are people who are checking the box in this election,” said Sinclair. Windspeaker.com reached out to the four main parties to get their numbers of Indigenous candidates. The New Democratic Party leads the way with 27; the Liberals have 25; and the Conservatives have five. However, only the Conservatives provided a list of names and constituencies. The Green Party was still “working on this information,” according to a spokesperson. The NDP led the way in 2019 also with 27 candidates. The Liberals have added 10 Indigenous candidates to their slate of 15 from 2019. The Conservatives dropped from seven in 2019. The number of Indigenous MPs could potentially rise on election day because of the high number of Indigenous candidates running. In 2015, with 54 Indigenous candidates, a record-setting 10 were elected to Ottawa. That number remained in 2019. This time around, eight of the 10 Indigenous incumbents are seeking re-election. “It’s a very low bar to pass. You only have to pass 10 and you’ll get the highest record of all time,” said Sinclair. While Courtney Skye, research fellow with the Indigenous think-tank the Yellowhead Institute, expects incumbents to do well, she says new Indigenous candidates are not all running in strong ridings. She says she has spoken with some Indigenous candidates who feel they’re a “stand-in” in ridings they have little chance of winning or in “historically poor performing ridings.” CBC Radio released a study in August that indicated white male candidates more often ran in “safe” seats. Three out of four candidates who ran in ridings that their party had won in the two previous elections by at least 10 per cent were white males. The study also found that white male candidates received 10 per cent more funding from their parties and riding associations. Assembly of First Nations National Chief RoseAnne Archibald is not endorsing any party or candidate, but says it’s “important that Indigenous candidates are running.” “What I do want to say is there are many Indigenous people running across Canada and I do want to wish all of the Indigenous First Nation candidates the absolute best in this election in their run … That’s for any party, no matter who they are,” said Archibald when the AFN released its five-priority platform on Aug. 31. Arlen Dumas, grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, and Grand Chief Garrison Settee of the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, didn’t share Archibald’s hesitation as both came out during an NDP event in the riding of Churchill-Keewatinook Aski in support of Liberal candidate Shirley Robinson. Speaking a few days after the event, Dumas said, “I feel that the assembly is non-partisan. However, we do have to support our First Nations members and I thought that it was important when asked the question of how we were supporting candidates that we need to identify Shirley Robinson as our candidate for the north.” Robinson is a former chief of Cross Lake First Nation. Skye doesn’t believe Indigenous voters should mark the ballot for an Indigenous candidate simply because both voter and candidate are Indigenous. “I think people who are interested in participating in the federal system they need to look at the party platforms, they need to consider who the individual candidates are, whether or not there are strong candidates in their ridings,” said Skye. Sinclair agrees. “I think that voters of any place, of any culture, of any stripe should be looking at the candidates, at what they say and what they do, and then also the affiliations they have, the people who stand beside them and the people who work with them. That’s who I think people should be looking at when they decide who to vote for,” he said. Skye adds that some non-Indigenous MPs, and she names NDP incumbents Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay) and Matthew Green (Hamilton Centre), “are very influential and have done a lot for Indigenous nationhood.” She says these candidates need to be acknowledged as “strong allies” with the ability to “influence and advance Indigenous issues.” Sinclair cautions that “just because someone comes from a racial group doesn’t mean that they have a consciousness of that racial group.” Windspeaker.com Subject: Candidates; Native studies; Native North Americans; Elections"

"2021-09-09","Full text: People’s Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier is on his way to Chatham-Kent. The controversial leader of the fledgling party – quickly gaining ground from freedom fighting anti-vaxxers – is expected to make a stop at the Ultimate Sports Bar Sept. 15 to shore up support for the PPC. Chatham-Kent–Leamington candidate Liz Vallee said a fundraising lunch will be held. The Chatham resident, who is campaigning on rights and freedoms and less government involvement, said the party is experiencing a groundswell of support. “It’s changed in our favour dramatically,” Vallee said of the latest polling numbers. Despite that fact, Vallee won’t be attending the upcoming Chatham-Kent Chamber of Commerce federal election forum slated for Sept. 9. “It (the decision) screams discrimination to me and to the party,” Vallee said. “But I’m not surprised.” The Chatham-Kent chamber has excluded Vallee and Lambton-Kent-Middlesex hopeful Kevin Mitchell based on national polling numbers. Bernier is also excluded from national debates. Vallee said she is “shocked and disappointed” the PPC is being shut out, considering they could win the riding. Vallee has been a vocal opponent of mask and vaccine mandates, calling them a violation of basic rights. The Chamber event is billed as a Young People Business Inspired Federal Election Forum.

"2021-09-09","Full text: Mark Skagen, candidate for the newly formed Maverick Party, is looking to make the West a priority in the eyes of the Canadian Government. The Maverick Party is Canada’s new federal party that says they stand for Western ideals and people, and aren’t running any candidates past the Manitoba/Ontario border. “We're not a party that's influenced by Eastern masters,” said Skagen. ""People say to me ‘Well, who do we have to please down east’ and my response is absolutely nobody. I don't have to please anyone in central Canada or other political parties that claim to be the voice for Western Canada, but they’re not.” Skagen, a long time conservative, said he joined the Maverick Party because he realized a strong voice was needed for Western Canada. “Over the years, I've been involved in politics but always on the outskirts,” he explained. “I manned booths, put up signs and what have you, and I did that for the Conservative Party most of my life. And I got to the point where I realized that it was almost pointless to keep doing the same thing we did year after year, election after election.” “It occurred to me that what we really needed was a strong voice for Western Canada, that's exclusive to Western Canada,” he added. The Maverick Party's platform includes ending equalization payments, ending carbon tax, repealing Bills C-48 and C-69 (North Pacific oil tanker ban and no new pipelines), ending federal paid media, and opposition to the firearms ban. If Skagen was elected to Parliament, he says he would like to see the government pay attention to the small villages and towns in the Southwest of the province. “I've traveled the length and breadth of this district, and all our little towns and villages seem to be deteriorating,” he stated. ""They have busted up pavement and potholes and broken sidewalks, and very few new buildings.” “And I know these little villages and towns don't have the money to do infrastructure, they can't possibly tax the people any heavier,” he added. Skagen explained that the next time the government talks about urban renewal, he will bring up rural renewal. “I would like to get some of these towns and villages back where they need to be,” he commented. “There's a lot of talk on the news about affordable housing, and I say, well my goodness, come to our district. There's lots of little places that have very affordable housing.” Skagen said that we need to concentrate on building up the district and that when the government wants to build a new facility, they should look at Shaunavon, Maple Creek or Kindersley as examples of where it could be done. “I would just like to point out that this election, people have a choice between either choosing one of the legacy parties, or choosing a new direction for the West,” Skagen said. Skagen is currently living with his wife, Linda, in the Tompkins area. He is a former Oil Executive from a company based out of Alberta. Subject: Affordable housing; Elections"
"2021-09-09","Full text: Today in History - Sept. 7 Today in History for Sept. 7: In 1533, England's future Queen Elizabeth I was born to King Henry VIII and Queen Anne Boleyn. She ruled 45 years, from 1558 to 1603. In 1763, Britain's King George III issued a proclamation urging subjects to settle in Canada. In 1813, the nickname ""Uncle Sam"" was first used as a symbolic reference to the United States in an editorial in a newspaper in Troy, N.Y. In 1816, ""The Frontenac,"" the first Canadian-built steamship on the Great Lakes, was launched at Ernestown (now Bath), Ont. In 1822, Brazil declared its independence from Portugal. In 1860, the Maple Leaf was first used as an official emblem during a visit to Toronto by the Prince of Wales. In 1892, James Corbett knocked out John L. Sullivan in the 21st round of their heavyweight boxing match in New Orleans. It was the first major title bout to be fought under the Marquess of Queensbury rules. In 1901, the Peace of Peking was signed by China and 11 foreign countries, ending ""The Boxer Rebellion."" In 1907, the British liner RMS Lusitania set out from Liverpool, England, on its maiden voyage, arriving six days later in New York. On May 7, 1915 during the First World War, it was sunk by a German submarine off the coast of Ireland with the loss of nearly 1,200 civilian lives. In 1910, the International Court at The Hague resolved a fishing dispute between the United States, Canada and Newfoundland. The court ruled that each government had the right to regulate its own fisheries but suggested Canada and Newfoundland inform the United States at least two months before they made any changes to their regulations. In 1916, the U.S. Senate ratified the purchase of the Virgin Islands. In 1927, American television pioneer Philo T. Farnsworth, 21, succeeded in transmitting the image of a line through purely electronic means with a device called an ""image dissector."" In 1940, what came to be called ""The Blitz"" began when London suffered the first concentrated night air raid by German planes during the Second World War. In the first three nights, 1,000 people were killed and 3,500 seriously injured. The Royal Air Force prevented invasion during 1940, but the civilian population endured years of bombing before the tide of war turned. In 1952, the Canadian liner ""Princess Kathleen"" ran aground and sank off Lena Point, Alaska. Her 300 passengers and crew of 115 were all rescued. The incident occurred during the highest tide of the season, and it was the falling tide that sank her. In 1958, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that any attack on China would be regarded as an attack on the Soviet Union. In 1959, Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis died in Schefferville, Que. He founded the Union Nationale party in 1936 and led it to victory in a provincial election that year. Duplessis's first term was a disappointment and his government was defeated in 1939. The Union Nationale was returned to office in 1944 and Duplessis remained in office until his death. In 1969, the Official Languages Act declared English and French as the official languages of Canada. The act, promoted by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, declared all federal institutions had to provide services in English or French at the customer's choice. In 1973, the Northwest Territories Supreme Court allowed the Indian Brotherhood of the N.W.T. to file a land claim for one-third of the territory. In 1977, Cindy Nicholas of Toronto became the first woman to complete a return, non-stop swim of the English Channel. In 1977, the United States and Panama signed treaties calling for the U.S. to give up control of the Panama Canal by 2000. In 1983, the Canadian tour of the Moscow Circus was cancelled after five of the nine cities on the tour cancelled performances in reaction to the Korean airline disaster. Two-hundred and sixty-nine people, including 10 Canadians, were killed when the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 after it accidentally entered Soviet airspace on Sept. 1. In 1986, Bishop Desmond Tutu was installed as Archbishop of Cape Town, becoming the first black head of South Africa's Anglican Church. In 1991, Edwin McMillan, a co-discoverer of plutonium who worked on the Second World War project that developed the atomic bomb, died at age 83. In 1994, James Clavell, best-selling author whose books include ""Shogun,"" ""Noble House"" and ""Tai-Pan,"" died in Switzerland at age 69. In 1995, Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. and North American Life Assurance Co. announced a merger. In 1995, the Quebec government tabled Bill I, the legislation that would give the National Assembly the power to declare Quebec a sovereign country after a referendum victory. In 2000, University of Toronto researchers reported the discovery of a key protein that acts as a trigger in the degeneration of nerve cells in Alzheimer's disease. In 2001, Ashley Cowan, 15, of Toronto, became the youngest teen and the first disabled person to complete a 20-kilometre swim across Lake Erie. Cowan, a quadruple amputee, finished in slightly more than 15 hours. In 2001, surgeons working in New York used a remote-controlled robot to remove the gall bladder of a 68-year-old woman in France in the first cross-oceanic operation. In 2005, President Hosni Mubarak won his fifth six-year term in Egypt’s first contested presidential election. In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper ignored his own fixed-date election law to call a general election for Oct. 14. That was more than a year ahead of the October 2009 date envisioned in Conservative legislation that passed the Commons with little dissent. Harper argued the minority Parliament had become dysfunctional and he required a fresh mandate to navigate the troubled economic waters ahead. In 2008, the U.S. government took over control of mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee about half of U.S. mortgage debt, in an attempt to ease the financial crisis that followed the housing collapse. In 2009, a London jury convicted three British Muslims of conspiring to blow up at least seven airliners bound for the U.S. and Canada in what was intended to be the largest such attack since Sept. 11, 2001. Their alleged plan was to kill thousands of people by blowing up commercial passenger planes in mid-air with liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks. They were each sentenced to 30 years in prison. In 2010, Claude Bechard, a youthful Quebec cabinet minister who soldiered on in his post despite suffering from pancreatic cancer, died on at the age of 41. In 2010, Ontario and B.C. launched all-day kindergarten programs -- P.E.I. started theirs on Sept. 9. In 2011, in one of the worst air disasters in sports history, a plane carrying members of the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team of Russia's KHL crashed into the banks of the Volga River moments after takeoff. Forty-three people died in the crash and a player who survived the initial impact died five days later in hospital, leaving the flight engineer as the only survivor. The entire Lokomotiv team perished, including Canadian coach Brad McCrimmon and former NHL players Pavol Demitra, Josef Vasicek, Karel Rachunek, Karlis Skrastins and Ruslan Salei. The crash put Russia's troubled aviation industry in the spotlight but investigators later blamed it on pilot error. In 2012, while in Moscow, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird announced the Canadian embassy in Iran would close immediately and expelled Iranian diplomats in Ottawa. He cited safety concerns in Tehran and the longstanding view that Iran is a threat to global peace. In 2014, a Canadian search team solved one of the world's great exploration mysteries with the discovery of HMS Erebus in the Queen Maud Gulf. It was one of two lost ships from Sir John Franklin's doomed Arctic expedition during an 1845 quest for the Northwest Passage. In 2017, credit monitoring agency Equifax revealed there had been a cyberattack on July 29 that exposed the Social Security numbers and other sensitive information of about 145 million people in the U.S., approximately 19,000 in Canada and almost 400,000 in the UK. In 2017, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake — one of the most powerful ever recorded in Mexico — killed 98 people and toppled hundreds of buildings. The epicentre was located off the country's southern coast near the Guatemalan border. In 2018, a Saskatchewan judge ordered a group of protesters to remove their teepees from the lawn outside the provincial legislature in Regina. Protesters set up the teepees at the end of February to bring attention to racial injustice and the disproportionate number of First Nations children in care. In 2018, federal officials said not one highly endangered North Atlantic right whale had died as a result of a ship strike or fishing gear entanglement during the summer fishing season in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Fisheries Department said restrictions put in place to protect the species following a dozen deaths in Canada the previous year were a success. In 2018, the last man to emerge from a shattered mine in Springhill, N.S., decades earlier died at age 95. His obituary said Herb Pepperdine mined coal all his life and spent eight days trapped in the Springhill mine after an underground explosion on Oct. 23, 1958. In 2019, post-tropical storm Dorian left large swaths of Atlantic Canada battered and in the dark as it moved out into the North Atlantic. Emergency officials warned the widespread mess, including countless downed trees and power lines, would take some time to clean up. Nova Scotia Power C-E-O Karen Hutt called the situation a ""worst case scenario'' and said it would likely be a week before the lights were back on in all areas of the province. In 2019, Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu (an-DRESS'-koo) upset Serena Williams 6-3, 7-5 in the U.S. Open final. It wasn't just the 19-year-old's first Grand Slam title -- it was the first Grand Slam win for a Canadian. Andreescu's victory prevented Williams from claiming what would have been her record-tying 24th major singles championship. Two days later, the new WTA rankings were released, vaulting Andreescu into a career high Number 5 spot. In 2020, New Brunswick's Progressive Conservative leader dropped one of his candidates after learning the man had re-posted a Facebook message containing transphobic language. Blaine Higgs said he was disturbed by the re-posting of a transphobic meme by Roland Michaud. It suggested physical violence against transgender women when they use restrooms. Michaud apologized for circulating the meme, but said he didn't intend to withdraw his name from the race. --- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Fisheries; Diplomatic & consular services; Language policy; World War II; Aviation; Provincial elections; Earthquakes; Alzheimers disease"
"2021-09-09","Full text: Simmering tensions along Justin Trudeau’s campaign trail flared in London Monday night when the Liberal leader was struck with a handful of rocks thrown from a crowd of protesters. About 100 protestors, many wearing the purple of the People’s Party of Canada, gathered, chanting with signs outside London Brewing Co-Op in east London where Trudeau had stopped for a brief appearance inside with local Liberal candidates. It was his first campaign stop in London. As he stepped back into the campaign bus, someone threw a handful of small rocks that appeared to hit him. Trudeau glanced back, but the pebbles appeared to cause no harm. A national CTV reporter said two members of the media were also hit, and unhurt. The craft beer pub is located in London North Centre, where Liberal candidate Peter Fragiskatos is seeking a third term in office. The riding has been largely Liberal-held for decades, dating back to Joe Fontana. Trudeau is the first federal party leader to visit London since the election was called Aug. 15. Trudeau pulled the plug on his minority government, sending Canadians to the polls Sept. 20, nearly two years since the October 2019 election. cleon@postmedia.com twitter.com/CalviatLFPress Subject: Elections"

"2021-09-08","Full text: Maverick Party candidate Colin Krieger made a pit stop in Whitecourt on Monday, August 30, inviting residents to attend a town hall event at the Forest Interpretive Centre. During the hour-long talk, Krieger spoke about his past experiences and why the time is right for a west-only party. ""I am not a politician by trade. I drove truck, had a small business, and the last 15 or so years I've worked as an oilfield operator,"" said Krieger. His great grandfather moved into the Valleyview area in the late 1920s, and his grandfather homesteaded in the area. ""We've been there pretty much ever since."" On why he wanted to put his name in the ring for the Maverick Party, Krieger said that this step is the most important thing he can think of doing. ""I'm a new grandpa. I have an eighteen-month-old grandson. He is an absolute joy in my life, and it occurred to me that the way things are going, left unchecked, his opportunities will not be the same as mine or ours. The things that we had available to us for opportunities will not be his and indeed will not be your children and grandchildren's either."" As signs pop up across the area, residents might be wondering if the party is new, and the answer is yes. ""The Maverick Party is approximately one year old. We are new, but that does not mean we are inexperienced. Our interim leader Jay Hill was a member of parliament for 16 years in the riding by Dawson Creek. He served underneath Stephen Harper and is a very accomplished man. He knows how the system works and knows what it takes to start a new party because he was also involved at the very beginning stages of the Reform Party."" Krieger explained that Western Canada needs ""a clear voice in Ottawa"" and that the representatives elected here do not fully provide that because of party politics. ""National parties need to be re-elected, and they are chasing the prime minister's chair. They want to fill that chair with somebody from their party. If they want to do that, they need votes in Ontario and Quebec, and if it takes money to accomplish that from Western Canada, then that's what they will do. We know this. We've seen it."" A fan of history, Krieger brought up a cartoon that many Albertans would recognize. ""In 1905, Alberta became a province. Ten years later, there was a very famous cartoon printed. It's a large map of Canada with a cow standing on it, being fed on the West coast and milked on the East. That was printed in 1915. Just ten years later, Albertans were starting to realize that we were getting a raw deal in this Canadian confederation. A hundred and six years later, that cartoon still matters. People from here still understand what it means. That is the reason we need the Maverick Party."" Krieger said that getting solid representation in Ottawa would mean not pleasing Eastern voters, which no other party can risk doing. ""The only way that we can do that is by never running candidates there. The Maverick Party will only ever be fielding candidates in Western Canada, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and eventually the territories. The reason we do that is so that when we go to Ottawa, we can advocate our needs without worrying about how it's going to be viewed in the East."" One of the Maverick Party's promises is that Maverick MPs will have two goals: a twin-track solution. ""Track A is constitutional change,"" began Krieger, including a Triple E Senate (Equal, Elected and Effective). ""Equal means every jurisdiction in the country will get the same number of representatives no matter how many people live in that province or territory. Elected means that we can fire them if they aren't doing their jobs. Just like me. You need to be able to fire me if I'm not doing my job. And it needs to be effective."""
"2021-09-08","Full text: People should find time to go out and vote in the election unless they're too busy, says Minalini Mittal. Ahead of the upcoming federal election Monday, Sept. 20, two Timmins immigrants shared why they’re going to vote and gave some tips for first-time voters. Mittal, who moved to the city from Toronto a few years ago, encourages voters to do research beforehand and think about what issues they care about. “You should have some knowledge before you go out to vote. Please don’t vote blindly,” she said. “At least, listen to what the candidates are saying about what they want to do.” Mittal and her husband Deepak Datta voted in the 2019 federal election. She hasn’t faced any barriers or challenges except when her voter information card was mailed to her home address but her husband’s card didn’t arrive. When they went to vote, Datta was able to register on the spot. Overall, the voting process went “very well,” Mittal said. “As long as you can speak basic English language, you can go and vote,” she said. To decide which party to vote for, she listened to the election debates. “It was pretty surreal to vote, feeling that your vote will actually count and reach somewhere. And your voice will be heard,” she said. Mittal moved to Canada in 2008 as an international student. As her and Datta's lives became busier with work and children, they didn’t have a chance to vote until 2019. Mittal also once voted in the provincial election. According to Statistics Canada, five per cent of Canadians who didn't vote in the 2019 federal election said their reason for not voting was due to issues with the electoral process, including not being able to prove their identity or address, a lack of information about the voting process or issues with the voter information card. Almost half of the non-voters, 46 per cent, cited everyday life reasons for not voting, including being too busy, having an illness or disability or being out of town. Climate change, housing, immigration, supporting young families and seniors are some of the top issues for Mittal. She’s still making up her mind for whom to vote in this election and is eagerly waiting for the debates. Last time, she voted for the Liberal party. Mittal said she hasn’t heard anything about the local MP candidates and doesn’t know how to find more information about who’s running in Timmins and what they’re campaigning for. “That’s what matters to me. I’m living in Timmins, so what can we do about Timmins to make it more popular, to gain more tourism here? People should come and spend in Timmins,” she said suggesting the local candidates reach out more to the voters. “Just seeing the signs in the city is not enough. You may know the name of the candidate but not more than that.” Another Timmins resident Adarsh Neelam has been living in the city for the past seven years. He has recently received Canadian citizenship, so this will be his first time voting in the federal election. “I want to utilize my right to vote as a citizen,” he said. With his new passport, he received a paper containing information from Elections Canada. He checked to see if he’s on the list of electors and now he’s excited to be able to vote. He follows the election news and looks forward to the debates. Neelam, who’s the owner of Speedy Auto Service in Sudbury and Neelam Taxi in Timmins, wants to see a change in the city. For him, more housing options and more newcomers to fill the labour gap are needed in Timmins. “For the last seven years, I’ve hardly seen a change,"" he said. Neelam said he wants to see new faces and someone who has power with the government and can make decisions at the table. ""I want someone from the leading party in Timmins who will form the government,” he said. “That way, we can get more funds and more development.” He encourages voters not to wait until the last minute and to follow the COVID-19 protocols. Voting is important to get the right person to win, he said. “I wish the voting percentage will stay the same or increase, but not decrease because of COVID,” Neelam said. ""Hope we'll have a good percentage of people come out and utilize their vote."" For details on polling stations and voter information card, visit elections.ca. There are four candidates in Timmins-James Bay, NDP Charlie Angus, Liberal Steve Black, Conservative Morgan Ellerton and PPC Stephen MacLeod.

"2021-09-08","Full text: Truck driver, Jaspreet Singh, plans to vote for the first time in this federal election after arriving in Canada about six years ago. In his riding of Surrey-Newton, home to about 60,000 people where more than 60 per cent are South Asian New Canadians, all five candidates vying for the seat have South Asian heritage. “I haven’t made up my mind yet, but one key issue for me is who will stand up strongly for farmers rights in India,” he said. His family in Punjab are among the thousands in India fighting new farming laws passed last September, which they say will devastate their livelihoods and negatively impact ancestral land holdings. The Indian government says the reforms are needed to modernize the country’s agricultural industry. In the neighbouring Richmond-Centre, Ally Wang, who recently launched the website CCGTV.org or (Chinese-Canadians Go To Vote), is asking election candidates to publicly state their views on how they will respond to discrimination against the community, China-Canada relations, and what they will do if the English media vilifies the community. Wang believes these community-specific views will encourage the Chinese-Canadian community, which has a historically low voter turnout, to get out to the ballot box. The Richmond Centre riding, which has the second-highest population of Chinese-Canadians after Markham-Unionville in Ontario, had the lowest voter turnout in British Columbia in the 2015 federal election. Over in Quebec, which is home to some of the largest Muslim-heavy ridings in Canada, the Bloc Québécois has come out to condemn the human rights violations in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir, which has been claimed by both India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Constituents are asking what candidates will do if elected in order to ensure that Canada holds India accountable for its settler-colonization happening in Kashmir, a statement from the group Just Peace Advocates said. “Thousands of Canadians let the Canadian Government know this through petitions sponsored by three political parties, the Liberals, NDP and Conservatives, in the fall of 2021. Now the election is underway; we hope to hear from other federal political parties and their leaders regarding this matter,” said the group’s spokesperson Karen Rodman. In this election, where there seems to be no galvanizing subject other than the fact that three in four Canadians hate it, New Canadians are increasingly looking at how political candidates feel about issues in their homelands, say experts. Of 338 federal ridings in Parliament, 41 have populations where visible minorities form the majority, compared with 33 five years earlier. It is here where some of the key races are being held and where the New Canadian sentiment about issues pertaining to their home country could sway the vote, said Gurmant Grewal, a former Conservative MP, who represented the Surrey riding of Fleetwood—Port Kells from 2004 to 2015. “Candidates who can speak to and address issues affecting New Canadians in their homelands resonate with the ethnic communities,” said Grewal, who now runs an immigration consultancy in Surrey. “Here in Surrey, immigration policies have always been a big election topic…but the Conservatives here are not speaking to it because the Liberals have done a good job…so you are seeing candidates prioritize Canada-China tensions and the Indian farmer crisis to lure the ethnic vote,” he said. Andrew Griffith, a fellow of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute and the Environics Institute, said polling data suggests that New Canadians of South Asian heritage have a general tendency to vote Liberals or NDP while the Conservatives have fairly strong support from Chinese-Canadians. He agreed that candidates who can address issues pertaining to the homelands of New Canadians will resonate better with ethnic communities. “But we cannot assume New Canadians all vote the same way and think the same way about issues in their country of origin…that can backfire because the same polarizing values of an issue in the country of origin is also played out here. “Political parties have always taken demographic realities into account when selecting candidates,” he said. In an analysis of the 2015 election, Griffith found that all the main parties increased their numbers of visible minority candidates to attract New Canadian voters. “According to my analysis, 14.4 percent of candidates were from visible minorities, a figure close to the percentage of visible minorities who are Canadian citizens. The election resulted in 47 visible minority MPs (13.9 percent of MPs), a record number and proportion for Canada. While most of these MPs were elected in ridings with large visible minority populations, nine were from ridings with 20 percent or fewer visible minorities,” said the analysis which used the latest available data. “17 percent of all ridings, meaning that any path to a majority government requires winning these ridings,” said Griffith in his post 2015 election analysis. The new Canadian vote could be pivotal is some key battleground areas especially for the Trudeau Liberals, said a political analyst in Victoria who declined to be quoted because he works for the provincial B.C. government. Based on the latest polls and at this stage of the campaign, most expect an outcome that will be either a Liberal minority government or a Conservative minority government, he said. “I don’t think this is what most Canadians want and if the ethnic voter turnout is strong, it could change that,” he said.

In 1952, the CBC opened the first television broadcasting facilities in Canada. The first station was CBFT in Montreal, which was followed by CBLT in Toronto two days later. Both outlets originally broadcast 18 hours of programming a week. Following its mandate that ""television in Canada should be essentially Canadian,"" the CBC at that time ensured that 60 per cent of its programs were produced in Canada. There were only about 100,000 TV sets in Canada at that time. In 1953, 30 Canadians were released in the final exchange of Korean War prisoners. In 1957, former prime minister Louis St. Laurent stepped down as leader of the Liberal party. He served as prime minister from 1948 until his party's defeat in a general election three months before. In 1964, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson handed B.C. Premier W.A.C. Bennett a cheque for $273 million regarding the Columbia River Power agreement. In 1966, South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd was assassinated during a parliamentary session in Cape Town. The assassin was a drifter who claimed the government was doing too much for the non-whites and not enough for the ""poor whites."" In 1968, Swaziland became an independent member of the British Commonwealth. In 1975, more than 2,300 people were killed in an earthquake in eastern Turkey. In 1975, Czechoslovak-born tennis star Martina Navratilova requested political asylum in the U.S. during the U.S. Open in New York. In 1977, highway signs across Canada, except in Quebec and Nova Scotia, were converted to metric. In 1977, Canadian author Leslie MacFarlane died in Whitby, Ont. He was 74. He wrote the first 20 books of ""The Hardy Boys"" adventure series. In 1981, in Poland, the Solidarity union held the first independent labour congress ever staged in the Soviet bloc. Union leaders released statements declaring that revolution was under way in Poland. In 1987, SaskWest Television became the first television company in Canada to put out two simultaneous air signals in two different cities, Regina and Saskatoon. In 1990, one of Canada's biggest political upsets saw Ontario elect its first NDP government. Bob Rae's New Democrats ousted David Peterson's Liberals, winning 74 of 130 seats. The Rae government lasted only one term, losing the 1995 election to the Conservatives under Mike Harris. In 1991, the Soviet Union granted full independence to the three Baltic republics -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Another legacy of Communist rule also disappeared -- parliament voted to restore the pre-Bolshevik name of St. Petersburg to the country's second-largest city -- Leningrad. In 1995, Dudley George, one of a group of aboriginal protesters occupying Ipperwash Provincial Park on Lake Huron in Ontario, was shot dead by police. The protesters were claiming the park occupied a sacred burial ground. (A police officer was later convicted of criminal negligence causing death). In 1995, Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. eclipsed Yankee great Lou Gehrig's ironman record by playing in his 2,131st straight game. (Ripken extended the record to 2,632 games before sitting out a game against the Yankees on Sept. 21, 1998.) In 1997, about one million people lined the streets of London as the funeral procession of Diana, Princess of Wales, made its journey from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey. For the first time in history, the Union Jack flew at half-staff above Buckingham Palace to mark the passing of someone who was not a member of the royal family. In 1998, in the first dynastic succession in any Communist country, Kim Jong-il was entrenched officially as North Korea's supreme leader, heading the state, the military and the governing Workers party. In 2005, California’s State Assembly became the first legislative body in the U.S. to approve same-sex marriages, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger later vetoed the bill. In 2005, Eugenia Charles, former prime minister of Dominica, the world’s first black female head of a country, died at age 86. In 2007, Italian Opera legend Luciano Pavarotti died after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 71. In 2009, Maj. Yannick Pepin, 36, and Cpl. Jean-François Drouin, 31, both members of the 5 Combat Engineer Regiment who were stationed in Valcartier, Que., were killed when a roadside bomb hit their armoured vehicle in the Dand district southwest of Kandahar city in Afghanistan. In 2011, Germany's top criminal court threw out the tax evasion conviction of former arms-industry lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber and ordered a retrial after saying errors were made in the 2010 process. The German-Canadian former arms industry lobbyist had been extradited to Germany after an Ontario court denied his bid to stay in Canada following public hearings into his controversial financial dealings with former prime minister Brian Mulroney. (In late 2013, he was again found guilty and sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison.) In 2011, former media baron Conrad Black returned to a low security Miami prison to complete the last 13 months of his sentence. He had been free on bail for about a year after an appeal court reversed two of his three fraud convictions. In 2011, a man with an AK-47 assault rifle shot a group of five uniformed National Guard members eating breakfast at a Nevada restaurant, killing three of them and another person. Seven others were wounded. The suspect shot himself and later died at a hospital. In 2014, former federal cabinet minister Jim Prentice won the Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership race to become premier-designate, replacing Alison Redford who had resigned amid a travel expense scandal. On Oct. 27, Prentice won a seat in the legislature as his party won four provincial byelections. (In May 2015, the NDP won the Alberta election, toppling the PC dynasty and driving Prentice from politics.) In 2017, the Bank of Canada raised its overnight lending rate to 1.0 per cent, its second quarter-point increase since July. In 2017, Category 5 hurricane Irma, the strongest Atlantic Ocean hurricane ever recorded with wind gusts of 298 km, made landfall as it passed the Caribbean islands of Antigua and Barbuda. Its 640-km path continued over Puerto Rico and Cuba before slamming the Gulf Coast of Florida as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 10 and weakening to a tropical depression through the U.S. southeast. Irma killed 38 people in the Caribbean and another 36 in the U.S. In 2018, India's Supreme Court struck down a colonial-era law that made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a landmark victory for gay rights that one judge said would ""pave the way for a better future."" In 2018, film and TV star Burt Reynolds died at age 82. Reynolds enjoyed a prolific career with a mix of critically acclaimed roles including ""Deliverance"" and ""Boogie Nights"" and commercial hits such as ""The Cannonball Run"" and ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He won an Emmy for the TV series ""Evening Shade."" In 2018, a powerful earthquake on Japan's main northern island of Hokkaido triggered dozens of landslides that crushed houses under torrents of dirt, rocks and timber. After days of searches, Japanese authorities said 41 people had been killed and more than 650 were injured. In 2018, a Dallas police officer shot and killed a 26-year-old man in his own apartment. Amber Guyger said she mistook his apartment for her own home and believed he was a burglar. Guyger was charged three days later with manslaughter and was fired on Sept. 24. In 2018, a computer programmer who was working at the behest of the North Korean government was charged in connection with several massive cyberattacks, including the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 and the WannaCry ransomware attack that affected hundreds of thousands of computers. In 2019, Robert Mugabe, who governed Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced to resign in 2017, died at 95. Mugabe took a country shining with the promise of independence and left it economically shattered and in the grip of repression. There was mixed reaction in Zimbabwe to the news of his death, with some blaming him for the country's economic turmoil and human rights violations and others saying life got worse after he left office. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Explorers; Earthquakes; Lobbyists; Assassinations & assassination attempts; Political leadership; Prime ministers"
"2021-09-08","Full text: Gun policy, China dominate election campaign trail OTTAWA - Canada's party leaders entered the fourth week of the federal election campaign expressing support for the families of two men who have been detained in China for 1,000 days. Sunday also saw the Liberals escalate their attacks against Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole over his apparent flip-flop on a platform promise to repeal an ""assault-style"" firearms ban introduced last year and subject it to a review if he forms government after the Sept. 20 election. Hours before O'Toole, who has faced days of questions over his firearms policy, made his remarks, Trudeau hit on the issue by championing his government's action on gun control in the Greater Toronto Area. He promised to tighten measures imposed last year even further by limiting the number of rounds high-capacity gun magazines can hold and providing $1 billion for provinces wishing to ban handguns. But Trudeau first opened his remarks in Markham, Ont., by acknowledging Sunday was a difficult one for the relatives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor as they marked the thousandth day of their incarceration in Chinese prisons. ""I can assure you that this government over the past 1,000 days has put forward all the different range of tools that we have to put pressure on the Chinese government to return Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, on our allies to influence them and to have them advocate for us,"" said Trudeau. ""We've been significantly more successful than the previous government was because we use all the tools at our disposal, usually not shouting in the public square. We usually lean in, and put pressure on those countries in various ways to ensure that we can get Canadians home in a way that is quiet and effective."" Chinese officials detained the men out of what Canada believes to be retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 while she travelled through the Vancouver airport. She was arrested on an extradition request from the United States, where officials want her to be prosecuted for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. On Sunday, New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh renewed his calls for Canada to work with its international allies to do everything possible to free the men who have come to be known as ""the two Michaels."" ""I can't even imagine what that's like for Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor, for their families, for their loved ones,"" he said from Ottawa, where he pledged to boost vaccination rates against COVID-19 and change the Criminal Code to provide better protections to health-care workers. ""One thousand days in conditions that have been pretty horrible, not having access to human rights, not having access to the same dignity that you would expect in a criminal justice system here in Canada."" The Liberal government has faced criticism from some over its handling of Kovrig and Spavor's ongoing detentions. The Conservatives, in particular, have said the Liberals have been soft on their policy towards a more authoritarian China, and promised to take a tougher approach if they win the election. In his election platform, O'Toole pledges to negotiate new trade agreements with nations in the Indo-Pacific and Africa so Canada doesn't have to rely as heavily on China, as well as work with international allies in hopes of ""decoupling"" their supply chains from the Chinese regime. The Conservatives also promise to ban Huawei from Canada's 5G infrastructure and advise universities against partnering with Chinese ""state-controlled"" companies. ""I've often said China might be much larger in terms of population and economy, but they can learn a lot from us with respect to engagement for human rights, dignity and the rule of law,"" O'Toole said at a campaign stop in Vancouver. ""Our sanctions would be meant to highlight the fact that the two Michaels are in prison as diplomatic pawns. That is unacceptable for a country that projects itself as a world-leading country. We'd like to push the communist regime to do better."" While campaigning in British Columbia on a promise to put more RCMP officers in communities to combat gangs and drugs, O'Toole clarified that if he forms government, a 2020 ban the Liberals placed on some reclassified firearms would remain in place. In May 2020, Trudeau's government banned some 1,500 firearm models, including the popular AR-15 rifle and the Ruger Mini-14, used in some of the country's deadliest shootings. O'Toole had promised to repeal the order-in-council that instituted the ban, but after several days of attacks from the Liberals about striking a deal with the country's gun lobby, he clarified the ban would stay in place. He pledged, however, to conduct a review of Canada's system for classifying firearms if voted into office. The Liberals seized on that promise, saying it offers a wink and a nudge to groups representing gun owners that he intends to keep his commitment to repeal the existing legislation.

O'Toole says his government's major aim would be to get Canada's vaccination rate up to 90 per cent.

"2021-09-07","Full text: Parties battle over guns, COVID-19 on Day 21 The three main federal parties traded fire Saturday over their responses to gun violence and to the resurgence of COVID-19 on Day 21 of the federal election campaign. Liberal candidate Bill Blair, a former Toronto police chief, unloaded on Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole's response to the Liberal government's ban on some 1,500 firearm models, including the popular AR-15 rifle and the Ruger Mini-14 used to kill 14 women at Montreal's Ecole polytechnique in 1989. The ban means they cannot be legally used, sold or imported. The Conservative election platform promises to scrap the May 2020 order-in-council that banned the wide variety of guns and review the Firearms Act with input from police, gun owners, manufacturers and the public. But O'Toole seemed to backpedal on the pledge on both Thursday and Friday by saying the party would ""maintain the ban on assault weapons"" when pressed about his platform pledge. A party spokeswoman later said in an emailed statement that O'Toole does promise to repeal the May 2020 ban but not the prohibition of full-fledged ""assault weapons"" — distinct from what the Liberals call ""assault-style"" weapons. That ban has been in place since 1977. Reporters pressed O'Toole on the matter during a campaign stop in Coquitlam, B.C., repeatedly asking whether he would repeal the ban on specific weapons used in mass shootings in recent years. ""We will maintain a ban on assault weapons and we will also have — it's in our policy — a transparent and public review of our classification system,"" O'Toole said, accusing the Liberals of divisive tactics. ""We will have that review, focusing on public safety and getting guns out of the hands of criminals that are being smuggled in from the United States."" Blair accused O'Toole of ""pretending that he had not made a commitment"" to maintain the Liberal ban, as well as of being beholden to the gun lobby. ""I think overwhelmingly Canadians recognize that there is no place for these guns in our country,"" he said at a news conference in Toronto. ""Mr. O'Toole is having difficulty admitting to Canadians that he's made that unholy pact with the gun lobby. He needs to be held to account."" Blair linked O'Toole's stance on gun violence to what he said was the previous inaction of the former Conservative government led by Stephen Harper, in which O'Toole served as a minister. Blair said he went looking for help on dealing with rising gun violence from the federal government while he served as Toronto's police chief, but said he got ""no help whatsoever from the Harper government."" Earlier Saturday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh accused the Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau of taking a hands-off approach with the provinces by not doing enough to encourage people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Singh levelled the accusation against Trudeau as he and O'Toole campaigned on opposite sides of the country. ""We have always said that the federal government has not played its role to provide national leadership with the changes in each province,"" Singh said Saturday in St. John's, N.L., where he was making an announcement on how his party would improve dental care. ""It's a global pandemic. It's a national pandemic. It impacts the entire country, so the approach of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been a little laissez-faire, too much washing the hands, saying: 'It's not my responsibility. I have done one thing, the rest is the responsibility of the provinces.'"""

"2021-09-06","Full text: Four Westport residents have filed nomination papers to be candidates in the upcoming byelection for a seat on the local council. The deadline for the Westport byelection came to a close at 2 p.m. Friday. The four residents are Mark Parliament, Frank Andrew Huth, Ami Carty and Rene Reynen. Currently, these candidates have not been certified to run for local office, but Paul Snider, the village's chief administrative officer and clerk, is expected to confirm their candidacies on Tuesday. The byelection is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 18, with an advance poll on Wednesday, Oct. 13. ""There are a number of things I have to do,"" said Snider. After confirming the candidacies of the four residents next week, Snider will have to complete and certify the electoral roll, calculate the spending amount for each of the candidates, advise residents of the local election, including who is officially in the running and when the election is to be held, get the voting polls ready and more. ""The byelection is simply because there was a resignation from council,"" said Snider. Following the resignation of former Coun. Melissa Sullivan in May, the council had three options to fill her place. They could have chosen to appoint someone to the position from the list of candidates in the last election in 2018, advertise an open position on council or hold a byelection, explained Snider. ""The council members thought they would rather see the electorate choose their representative on council and they opted for the byelection,"" added Snider. The decision for the byelection was agreed upon during a June meeting. Currently, the cost of the byelection is still unknown, but Snider says he has proposed a budget to council in the $2,000 to $3,500 range, similar to the previous elections he has held. Whoever wins the byelection will only serve one year. The next municipal elections will be held across Ontario on Monday, Oct. 24, 2022. Subject: Local elections; Councils"

"2021-09-06","Full text: Wheatland County Council voted to approve the use of special ballots in the 2021 municipal election during the regular council meeting held on Aug. 24. Special ballots for Siksika Nation had previously been discussed and approved, due to also hosting the votes regarding the Senate and Referendum election for the nation. “Normally in municipal elections where there would be an acclimation in a division, the county wouldn’t be responsible for holding an open voting station,” said County Reeve Amber Link. “Because of the provincial referendum questions and Senate vote, we’ll need to set up voting stations in each division in the county and so there will be an additional cost to municipalities across Alberta to host those votes for the province.” The province had previously agreed to provide a grant to cover the extra expenses of hosting the Senate election and Referendum vote for Siksika Nation. “They are compensating additionally for that, recognizing that there is a larger cost to the municipalities,” added Link. According to Section 77.1 of the Local Authorities Election Act (LAEA), special ballots are used when an elector is unable to vote due to a physical disability, absence from the jurisdiction, or for an election worker, candidate, official agent, or scrutineer located at a voting station. This will mark the first time special ballots of this nature will be provided to electors in the county. Those who choose to vote via the special ballot will be required to provide a photocopy of an authorized identification such as a driver’s license or Alberta Identification Card. Also noted on the ballots, Albertans will find questions regarding their input on topics in addition to the municipal elections. “At the same time that people will vote for councilors in the municipalities, they are going to vote on daylight saving time [and] equalization payments,” said Link. “The province deemed it more efficient to have voters go to the polls for the referendum and the municipal elections at the same time.” During the discussion, Division 7 Councillor Ben Armstrong asked county administration how the questions regarding equalization and daylight savings would be worded on the ballots. This was determined to be information administration would have to return to council to present. Those questions would be provided and worded by the province and will be consistent across Alberta. Special ballot packages will be made available on Sept. 29 and will have to be returned to the Wheatland County Administration office prior to the end of day on Oct. 18.

As of Thursday, the average daily number of new cases over the last week was almost 3,500, up from 2,900 a week ago, and just over 700 at the beginning of August. The number of people in intensive care units has also gone up during that time, to 241 from 199, and hospitalizations too are up to 559 from 419 — although the figures are far below the more than 1,200 people in intensive care and 4,500 hospitalized at the peak of the third wave over April and May. The Public Health Agency of Canada on Friday warned Canada could see more than 15,000 new cases a day by October under current transmission rates with the ramp up running through election day in two weeks' time. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters in Quebec City that the figures were a reminder of why it was problematic for Trudeau to pull the plug on his minority government and ""call a selfish summer election."" ""People are frustrated, people are upset. It's been a long pandemic and it's been a long and difficult time,"" Singh said after unveiling his party's promises to Quebecers. ""We can't now let down our guard and throw away all that sacrifice that was made. And so we need to make sure we're very careful and vigilant and prudent about how we move forward."" Singh, like Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, said he is prepared to fight an election virtually if public health officials demand renewed restrictions, although didn't detail his party's contingency plan. Speaking in Montreal, O'Toole pointed to a broadcast set the Conservatives created in a downtown Ottawa hotel as an avenue for him to make announcements and do call-in town halls with voters, which he has done at times since the campaign kicked off. He also noted Trudeau's suggestion after Thursday night's French-language debate that another minority government could send voters to the polls in another 18 months. ""We should not be in a campaign. Only Mr. Trudeau wanted this campaign for his own personal interest,"" O'Toole said. ""And last night, he threatened another election if he doesn't get his way with this one. Canadians deserve better than that.""

Green party Leader Annamie Paul said she's hearing from concerned voters about the health and safety of their families, including children heading back to school, many of whom are too young to be eligible for a vaccine. Added into the mix are concerns about the way politics is conducted in this country and how partisanship seems to have overtaken good public policy, Paul said. ""They're dismayed that we have this election for that reason,"" she said after calling for a national database to track police use-of-force. ""If there's one thing that people are hoping for, beyond the specific issues of concern, it's just that we will find more ways to get along with each other, to work in co-operation so that we can help people in a meaningful way.""

"2021-09-05","Full text: The New Democratic Party candidate Dan Gelinas is ready to ensure Chatham-Kent–Leamington has a strong, progressive voice in Ottawa. Gelinas has been a political organizer with the NDP since the late 70s and has organized 42 federal, provincial and municipal elections across Canada. An experienced worker in the auto sector, he has spent his entire life fighting to help make his community a better place for everyday people. He believes Canadians need a government in Ottawa that will make life more affordable and support our communities. Gelinas said he is ready to fight by protecting jobs for workers in the agricultural and auto sector. He believes we must invest in good local infrastructure, including high-speed internet connectivity and good health services at home. A proud father of 7, Gelinas has served on the Windsor Emancipation Committee Board Member and supported the LGBTQI2S+ community. He believes he can help build a future where racism, discrimination, homophobia, and transphobia have no place in Canada. Gelinas said when it comes to recovering from the effects of a global pandemic, small and medium-size businesses will need all the help they can get from governments in their effort to recover. “Recovery is dependent on getting women back to work, but without good childcare, it won’t happen,” said Gelinas. “The NDP will invest $20 Million over four years to make Universal Health Care a reality.” He added that the NDP would put a long-term hiring bonus in place to pay the employer portion of EI and CPP for new and rehired staff. “The NDP forced the Liberals to agree to an enhanced sick leave benefit and an extension of CERB with an increase from $1000 to $2000. Wage subsidies were also increased from 10 percent to 75 percent. We are committed to doing all we can to assist in a successful recovery. As part of his plan, Gelinas added he is ready to make life more affordable by ensuring everyone can access dental care, vision care, and prescription medication with their health card, opposed to their credit card. He added he and the NDP would fight for good change and make sure they are building more compassionate communities where no one is left behind. “As your NDP MP, I will make sure Chatham Kent Leamington gets all the necessities needed to recover,” said Gelinas.

"2021-09-05","Full text: Ontario legislature prorogued until October TORONTO, Kan. - Ontario's Progressive Conservatives have prorogued the legislature until after the federal election, a move the Opposition called an ""abdication of responsibility"" as the province fights a fourth wave of COVID-19. The government said Friday that the legislature will return on Oct. 4, two weeks after Canadians head to the polls. ""With a federal election underway, during which each party has put forward dramatically different policies and funding commitments that will have a direct impact on our government's legislative agenda, we have made the decision to prorogue the legislature,"" government house leader Paul Calandra said in a statement. Calandra said the results of the election will offer more certainty so the province can plan its fall legislation. Politicians had been on summer break since early June, and were due back Sept. 13. The prorogation – the first for the Tories since they took power in 2018 – will give Premier Doug Ford's government a chance to reset their priorities ahead of next year's provincial vote. The opposition parties decried the move. ""In the face of alarming Science Table data that shows the fourth wave of COVID-19 rising, Doug Ford’s decision to prorogue the legislature for three weeks is an unprecedented abdication of responsibility during a crisis,"" NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said in a statement. ""It's bad enough that Doug Ford has gone into hiding for over a month, now he is choosing to hide his entire government."" Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca also suggested the prorogation was part of a recent trend for Ford, who on Wednesday held his first news conference in over a month to announce a long-demanded vaccine certificate system. ""Everyone knows that Doug Ford has been hiding for the past two months,"" Del Duca said. ""He needs to go back to work now in order to deliver a real vaccine certificate, a better plan to reopen our schools and to help families get through this lingering public health crisis."" Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, meanwhile, characterized the decision as ""irresponsible."" ""Right now Ontarians need leadership. Instead they are stuck with a premier that is running from accountability and responsibility,"" he said. While it's not unusual for premiers to prorogue the legislature and start a new session, political science professor Cristine de Clercy said the timing of Ford's decision leaves him open to such criticism. ""His critics could rightfully charge that he is not at the forefront of Ontario's leadership right now, while the house is recessed,"" said de Clercy, who teaches at Western University. She also questioned the government line that the federal election is the reasoning behind the prorogation. ""I have been scratching my head trying to think about the last time I heard a provincial legislature proroguing because of a federal election, and I can't really recall such an incident,"" de Clercy said. ""So I think it is a little bit of an unusual circumstance."" The move to prorogue the legislature comes as COVID-19 infections have been rising in Ontario. The province's science advisers predicted this week that the highly transmissible Delta variant will see more unvaccinated people hospitalized this fall, with intensive care occupancy possibly exceeding the third wave. The COVID-19 Science Advisory Table said more than 85 per cent of the eligible population needs to be vaccinated against the virus and contacts need to be reduced to 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels to avoid a lockdown in the fall. The latest data shows 83.3 per cent of Ontarians aged 12 and up have had at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 76.8 per cent are fully vaccinated.

"2021-09-05","Full text: One reason Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau’s campaign may be flagging in his preferred stomping grounds in British Columbia, especially with young voters, is in part because he’s failing to push hard enough on climate change as a key election issue, one pundit suggests. The Liberals continue to wobble as the Tories maintain the lead in the polls this week — with Erin O’Toole’s Conservatives at 32 per cent of the decided popular vote, while the Liberals have dropped two points to 31 per cent. Meanwhile, the NDP and Leader Jagmeet Singh inched up two points to 23 per cent, according to an Ipsos poll released Wednesday. Climate change is a key issue this election, and not surprisingly, as hundreds died on the West Coast during a record-breaking heat wave at the end of June, and drought and wildfires continue to ravage the B.C. Interior. Given its significance, it’s puzzling the Liberal leader hasn’t focused more on climate change while courting B.C. voters, particularly in the Lower Mainland where Trudeau traditionally has traction, said Hamish Telford, a political science professor at the University of the Fraser Valley. Not to mention the issue’s import to millennial voters (those in the 25 to 40 crowd) whom the Liberals have to compete against the NDP for in urban ridings in the Lower Mainland, he said. “What has been surprising to me in this election campaign is that Trudeau has not really pushed his advantage on this issue,” Telford said. “If he were going to get a majority, it was almost certainly going to come from getting about 10 seats in Quebec and five seats in B.C., and climate change would be key to both of those provinces.” Across the board nationally, regardless of age and gender, almost one in five Canadians (18 per cent) say climate change is the primary single issue on which they’ll vote for a party, according to recent Angus Reid polls. That importance only mounts in B.C., where 24 per cent of those polled identify climate change as the top issue, a trend also seen among voters in Quebec (24 per cent), and in Ontario (18 per cent). In British Columbia, there’s pretty much a three-way tie between the top three parties, which are within five points of one another, with the NDP currently nursing a small lead. But B.C. is very regionalized when it comes to the vote on the ground, Telford notes, with much of the Interior and north of the province safe Conservative country, while Vancouver Island is largely an NDP stronghold with pockets of Green support. As such, voter priorities vary from riding to riding, with resource development being favoured in the north and the Interior, while climate change, housing affordability, and child care are the top concerns in Metro Vancouver, particularly for younger voters. But in some Lower Mainland ridings, it can be a three-way race, and the NDP is running a strong campaign, which might pull voters away from Liberals, giving an advantage to Conservatives in tight ridings, he said. Trudeau, who generally presents as fairly green, should be pointing to his record and commitments around climate and that he needs a mandate to see them through, Telford said, especially in light of the recent dire report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the subsequent importance of the UN climate summit, COP-26, this fall. “He could have said, ‘Look, we've just dealt with a pandemic, and now we have a climate change emergency that we need to deal with,’” Telford said “He may still do that in the closing days of the campaign, but it seems to me that he's missing a huge opportunity to press (his) advantage on that issue.” One stumbling block the Liberals have overcome when pitching climate plans in B.C. is the legacy of bad feelings from those opposed to the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline (TMX), said Kathryn Harrison, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia. “The Liberals have a challenge among climate-concerned voters in British Columbia because many of those voters feel very strongly opposed to the Trans Mountain pipeline,” Harrison said. “They bought that pipeline. They’re building that pipeline and the Liberals can’t escape that.” However, TMX is less of an issue in this election than in 2019, when the Liberals retained seats in ridings where the project was expected to be a particularly contentious issue, Harrison said. The Liberals released their climate plan on Sunday, promising cuts to the oil and gas sector’s emissions with five-year reduction targets starting in 2025 and to pick up the pace of Canada’s transition to zero-emissions vehicles. “I was surprised that the Liberals didn't come out with their climate plan earlier than they did, sort of two weeks into the campaign,” she said. “That may have disadvantaged candidates in British Columbia, who haven't been able to say what's in there in the first couple of weeks on the campaign trail.” However, the climate plan, and the full platform released Wednesday, have come out almost three weeks in advance of the vote and before the televised leaders’ debates, an arena where Trudeau has excelled in the past, Harrison said. “I think they gave their candidates something to work with,” she said. “It's increasingly clear that the Liberal Party's climate platform is much stronger than the Conservatives’.” Both the Liberals and the NDP have taken significant steps forward on climate change, but Trudeau has offered more specifics on issues, such as carbon pricing, she said. Waiting to release the climate plan may have been a strategic move on the Liberals' part, Harrison said, noting it provides the party the opportunity to beat or match the NDP’s commitments, like the five-year target set for the fossil fuel industry. However, in B.C. — where the election plays out with some narrow margins on a riding-by-riding basis — pushing climate policy at the expense of other top issues, such as affordability, housing, child care, and health, might be risky. “In ridings where the Liberals are competing with a Conservative candidate, the voters in between those two parties are less likely to be the ones where climate is the strongest motivating issue,” Harrison said. And while Trudeau might well capture millennial and some younger Gen Z support by honing in on climate change, those demographics can be fickle about turning out at the ballot box, Harrison said. “The big challenge with the youth vote is that the youngest voters tend to be especially concerned about climate change, but are the least inclined to vote.” Rochelle Baker/Local Journalism Initiative/Canada's National Observer None Subject: Polls & surveys; Child care; Environmental policy; Climate change; Pipelines; Elections"

The debate, which is in partnership with the Dufferin Federation of Agriculture and the Canadian Federation of University Women (CFUW) Orangeville & District, is scheduled to be a two-hour event broadcasted and streamed lived on Sept. 8 at 7 p.m. The debate will be moderated by DBOT treasurer Doug Harkness, and will address questions brought forward by the community. “Our main goal is to help local businesses thrive and one of the ways in which we help them thrive is through advocacy. We act as the voice of businesses in Dufferin County and bring concerns of our local businesses to those in power whether it be municipal, provincial, or federal leaders,” said Diana Morris, executive director of DBOT. “We find it important to ensure that the needs of the business community are front and centre during an election and we also find it important that we give the candidates the platform that business leaders, and members of the general public can hear from the candidates; and make informed decision before they vote.” “Our community needs to vote, it is imperative that everyone gets out and votes, and it makes sense to vote educated. To know the local candidates, to know their policies, their platforms, and their views so that you can vote for whom you truly believe will do the best representing our riding at the federal government.” The DBOT hosting an election debate has been a long standing tradition in the community, and in previous years they’ve been held at local high schools in Orangeville and Shelburne, with an attendance of around 300 people. Morris said given the social distancing restrictions, the local non-profit made the switch to a fully online debate. As part of their goal of informing residents on the various candidates, DBOT is also sharing completed bios of each candidate on their website and will also have a meet and great booth for the general public at the Think Local Market at Fiddle Park in Shelburne on Sept. 14. Voters will take to the polls for Canada’s 44th federal election on Sept. 20. The federal election comes after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Liberal) met with Gov. Gen. Mary Simon in mid-August, to request the dissolving of Parliament, which was approved. Canada’s next federal election was originally dated for October 2023.

"2021-09-05","Full text: To vote or not to vote? That is the question Indigenous people face every federal and provincial election. On Aug. 31, when the Assembly of First Nations released its five-priority platform for the federal election, National Chief RoseAnne Archibald weighed in. Like her predecessor Perry Bellegarde, Archibald encouraged people to vote. “First Nations voters can and will make a large impact on the results on election night,” said Archibald. The Native Women’s Association of Canada launched an aggressive campaign entitled “We’re done asking, we’re voting,” which aims to “activate Indigenous women from coast to coast to coast to get to the polls and have their voices heard,” said the news release. Both the Manitoba Metis Federation and the Métis Nation of Ontario are encouraging “all of our citizens” to vote. Despite these pushes by Indigenous organizations to get people to mark their ballots, Courtney Skye, research fellow with the Indigenous think-tank the Yellowhead Institute, says voting is a “contentious issue.” Some Indigenous people believe that Canada has long had policies of assimilation and “voting is another step along that way of assimilation and indoctrination,” said Skye. “The issue is, do you vote for your own oppression? Because Canada is a state that is invested and continues to be invested in the oppression of Indigenous peoples, the suppression of Indigenous rights and the denial of those rights in every aspect of the country,” said Niigaan Sinclair, an assistant professor in Native Studies at the University of Manitoba. “We continue to have a country in which Indigenous peoples are seen as second tier, are seen as lesser than, are deemed as not as important or an option for political parties to decide to deal with at some point. In that environment the fact is that it is very difficult to justify voting because if all the parties suck, why would you participate in any of it?” he said. Skye also brings attention to the existence of pre-Confederation treaties with the British Crown, including those held by her Haudenosaunee people. “If we expect the Crown to respect our nationhood and our autonomy over our affairs then we have to extend that back out of mutual respect, and so, for a lot of Indigenous people who consider themselves treaty people and expect the Crown to honour these treaties, then they follow through with that in their own conduct and they don’t vote in elections,” she said. For those who do choose to vote, Sinclair says it’s a matter of making a choice between “lessen(ing) the damage of voting in the party that will do the least amount of damage or you choose the party that will be complicit in your own oppression.” Skye isn’t as cynical as Sinclair. She says those who choose to vote are often “driven by frustration of the status quo and not necessarily (by) being indoctrinated into another system” and want to have Indigenous voices in the House of Commons. “Indigenous people make that choice for themselves, informed by their own history, their own treaty agreements, their own view, what riding they’re in, whether or not there’s a (good) candidate in their riding, whether they view their riding as close or not. There’s a lot of different things I think that go into Indigenous people making the choice of whether or not they’re going to vote in the upcoming election,” said Skye. She also points to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which “entrenches the human rights of Indigenous peoples and collective groups to participate in elections of the state without losing any of their rights and entitlements of Indigenous peoples.” Skye says it makes sense that the AFN would encourage its members to vote as “the AFN itself is a colonial construct … It’s a representative body of Indian Act band councils. They don’t represent nations; they represent First Nations as creations of the federal government. They are people who are trying to affect change within the system. I get where they’re coming from.” “Getting out the vote is a standard practise of all national chiefs,” said Sinclair, adding he believes that push goes back as far as Phil Fontaine who served as national chief from 1997 to 2000 and again from 2003 to 2009. “The AFN has to deal with the federal government and so if there’s a brown face in that government, naturally, they think that will evoke change,” he said. Skye observes that Inuit have a much different relationship with Canada than do the Haudenosaunee people. That difference became clear with the positive reaction from Inuit organizations when Inuk woman Mary Simon was appointed the new Governor General, the first Indigenous person to hold that position. In an earlier interview with Windspeaker.com, Aluki Kotierk, president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., said that having an Indigenous person representing the Queen was not a conflict, especially an Inuk, as “the experiences that we have had are quite different from First Nations and Métis.” As for the Métis, Sinclair says they are pleased with Trudeau’s Liberal government. While the Métis do have “longstanding issues … the fact is the Métis have been able to justify many of the policies that the Liberals addressed and they’ve found a very willing dance partner.” “While we believe that Justin Trudeau’s government has developed the strongest relationship with the Indigenous community in Canadian history, we are willing to work with any party that wins the election,” said Manitoba Metis Federation President David Chartrand in a news release. He also said the Red River Métis would be “actively participating” in the election. Skye believes the number of Indigenous voters has slowly increased over the years, but she is not counted among those numbers. Skye has never voted nor will she be this time around. “For me I make the personal choice to invest in our own communities, participate in our own governance structures and revitalize our traditional systems over leveraging power from the state to affect change,” said Skye. Sinclair, who is Anishinaabe, has voted in the past although not often. He’s more inclined to vote in provincial elections, he says, because that can influence policies that pertain to his career as a teacher. He is uncertain whether he’ll be voting federally this month. “Often for me it’s a determination of will my vote matter? Frankly, my vote never matters in the area I’ve lived,” said Sinclair. The federal election is Sept. 20.

Ten candidates, including Conservative incumbents Alice Wong in Richmond Centre and Kenny Chiu in the Steveston-Richmond East riding, are vying for your support in the two Richmond ridings during a 36-day campaign, the minimum campaign period under Elections Canada rules. Electors must be registered at their current address and can register through Elections Canada’s online service. Given the current pandemic, Elections Canada is strongly encouraging electors to take advantage of its online services. They can also contact the elections office in their riding or call 1-800-463-6868 for more information. Elections Canada will mail a voter information card to all registered electors by the first day of advance polls on Sept. 10. Advance polls will continue to be open through Sept. 13 from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. each day. The deadline to apply to vote by mail is 6 p.m. on Sept. 14 at any Elections Canada office or online at electionscanada.ca. And if you have applied to vote by special ballot, you cannot change your mind and vote at advance polls or on election day. Canadians who are 18 or older on election day, and able to provide accepted identification and current address, are eligible to vote. Turnout in the 2019 federal election on Oct. 21 was 67 per cent, down slightly from the 2015 election when just over 68 per cent of the 26 million registered voters cast ballots. The last time more than 70 per cent of registered voters cast ballots was in the 1992 fall election when 71.8 per cent exercised their democratic right. The Richmond Centre electoral district was created in 1987 and first contested a year later. Conservative Tom Siddon was the first Member of Parliament to represent the riding in the House of Commons, followed in 1993 by the election of Liberal Raymond Chan. Chan was re-elected to serve a second term from 1997 to 2000 when he was defeated by then-Alliance Party candidate Joe Peschisolido who, after crossing the floor, served as a member of the Liberal party from 2002 to 2004. Chan returned to Parliament in the 2004 election and was re-elected again in 2006. Chan was then defeated by Conservative Alice Wong in the 2008 election. Wong has remained the riding’s incumbent MP since. The Steveston-Richmond East riding was created by the 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution and first contested in 2015 with the election of Liberal Joe Peschisolido who defeated Conservative Kenny Chiu by fewer than 3,000 votes. The current incumbent, Chiu defeated Peschisolido by a similar margin in the 2019 election. Richmond Centre 2019 election recap • Conservative: Alice Wong (incumbent), 19,037 votes (49.04 per cent)"

Former Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is seen as losing the 2019 election because of a shaky performance in a French debate. Today, N-D-P Leader Jagmeet Singh spoke to reporters in Montreal in advance of the debate on T-V-A.

"2021-09-05","Full text: At the South Algonquin Human Resources/Administration/Public Relations committee meeting on Aug. 25, Bryan Martin, the CAO/clerk-treasurer, provided an update on the ongoing search and selection process to fill the Dickens Ward vacancy left by former Councillor Joe Vermaire, who resigned on July 27. So far, they have three applicants for the position and will be determining how they interview them, in an open or closed session, before selecting a candidate after the Aug. 31 deadline. At their Aug. 4 council meeting, South Algonquin council voted to select a replacement for Vermaire, instead of holding a by-election. It was felt that avoiding a by-election with only 16 months to go before a general municipal election would be more cost effective and more expedient than having a by-election. At the Aug. 25 HR/Admin/PR meeting, Councillor Sandra Collins, the chair of the committee, asked Martin for an update on the vacancy in Dickens ward and what sort of response they had gotten toward filling the vacant seat. “I know there’s been a letter from the president of the Aylen Lake Community Association [Sandra Gates] that requested that the person selected lives in the area because only people living there seem to know what’s going on,” she says. Collins then passed the floor over to Martin for his update. He said he’d had three applications to date and all three were from Dickens ward, to the best of his knowledge. “The legislation does not prohibit anyone from outside Dickens ward putting their name forward. The selection process is up to council. I did send out a bit of a questionnaire that you could use. However, if you didn’t want to, and council just wanted to pick a couple of questions to ask the individual, that would alright as well,” he says. Martin said they needed to set up a specific time and place for doing this interview, and due to it being a councillor and not a member of staff, it could be done in a public forum, versus in a closed session. Councillor Richard Shalla suggested going with the selection process based on the applicants’ cover letter and CV and that it might be better in the long run. “I’d feel more comfortable if council was aware we reviewed what was submitted and select them based on that and I think that’s how it was done in the past,” he says. Councillor Bongo Bongo said he loved the idea of having the interviews public on Zoom where the public can see the applicants and who they are. “If this could be done in a public forum, I think that would be fantastic. And we’d see how the candidates perform on this technological forum we use. I think that would provide us a lot of information on the candidates’ competency being public speakers,” he says. Bongo said he fully respected Shalla’s assertion that the cover letter and CV would be enough to select a new councillor, but he said he’d be more comfortable and confident making an appointment decision if they could have both of those things; the cover letter and CV and the public interview process. “I would want to set that up as soon as possible so long as the majority of council agrees,” he says. Collins said she agreed with Bongo somewhat, but wasn’t sure she wanted to subject the applicants to a public interview, nor was she sure they’d want to partake in such a public forum at this point. “When you apply for a job, you don’t want to let everyone know you didn’t get the job. I think it’s a little bit of a difficult situation,” she says. Mayor Jane Dumas agreed, saying a public interview could be quite intimidating to some people, and they should be respectful of that. She said that some applicants may not want people to know that they’ve applied at this point, as they may want to run in the 2022 municipal election. “I’m a little leery of putting people in that situation of being part of an interview that is recorded on YouTube and open to the public. I don’t know that I would support that process,” she says. In response to Shalla’s query, Collins recalled that she’d been selected by council for her seat by an interview. “I believe I was selected by my submission letter and there were 10 people overall, and that was obviously discussed at council and I was selected and interviewed,” she says. Dumas confirmed Collins’ recollection of her selection to council. “I think time is of the essence and we’d like to get someone at the table as soon as possible. I would recommend that we do as [Shalla] suggested and get the cover letter and CV, select a date and hopefully have a decision by the end of next week or the following week after the long weekend,” she says. Bongo said that if they didn’t do the public interviews, then he strongly suggested doing them privately, as he would feel more confident having both the cover letters and CVs and the input from the interviews to make an informed decision. “I really hope that’s what we decide to do. And I’m sure we can organize that in a pretty timely fashion as well,” he says. Martin told Bancroft This Week on Aug. 26 that once he gets clarity from council on the process, he’ll be able to divulge more information on the type of interviews they’ll be conducting. “At the moment, they may be dealt with in a closed session, in which case I will be providing the name of the successful individual [who’ll be the new councillor for Dickens ward]. Stay tuned,” he says. “I’ll advise as soon as I know more.” Subject: Committees; Local elections; Councils; Special elections; Interviews"
"2021-09-05","Full text: As housing prices continue to rise, residents – and potential residents – of the community have also pointed to a lack of other forms of housing stock, including rental options. In the second week of the 2021 Federal Election Campaign, party leaders agreed that housing is indeed a crisis in this country, and offered up their own solutions on how to address the problem. In order to get a local perspective on the matter, The Auroran asked confirmed candidates this week on how their party will address the housing crunch and what opportunities they see locally to make a difference. NEWMARKET-AURORA Conservatives, according to Newmarket-Aurora candidate Harold Kim are “well aware of the critical housing crisis in Canada” and agree that the cost of housing continues to “rise out of reach” for many, making it “nearly impossible” for first-time home-buyers to enter the market. “The Liberals’ Housing Strategy provided little relief for new homebuyers as most Canadians did not meet the complex criteria to access a shared equity mortgage which often required a high income, significant down payment, and was based on unrealistic house prices of less than $500k,” says Mr. Kim. “Clearly, Justin Trudeau does not understand what it is like to be a first-time homebuyer. The Conservatives get it. Under Erin O’Toole, a comprehensive housing plan will be implemented that sees an increase in home construction that keeps pace with Canada’s growing population. “We know there is a lot of foreign money – sometimes money laundering, money from proceeds of crime, or simply foreign investors buying up homes and sitting on them vacant – driving up prices and putting homeownership out of reach.” Conservatives, he says, will build one million homes over the next three years, release 15 per cent of government real estate to build homes and “encourage foreign investment in affordable, purpose-built rental housing.” Partnerships will be developed with both municipalities and the private sector, he adds, to bring new rental units to the housing market, in addition to tax incentives for new rental units. Seven to ten-year mortgages will be encouraged to “reduce the need for mortgage stress tests,” he adds. “Almost every street in Newmarket has at least one house that has been sold and left vacant, creating an eyesore for neighbours and impacting our tightly-knit communities,” says Mr. Kim. “Foreign investors buying homes and leaving them vacant, only to ‘flip’ them a year later for massive profits not only drains money out of Canada but increases housing prices exponentially for residents of this riding, well beyond the reach of our children who may wish to continue to live here as adults. Providing a ban on foreign investors who have no plans to move here relieves this serious problem and also tackles potential money laundering.” The Liberal plan also tackles the issue of foreign buyers and, says candidate Tony Van Bynen, a temporary ban on new foreign ownership of homes will be in the offing if his party re-forms government. “Our housing plan will build, preserve and repair more than $1.4 million affordable homes over the next four years, and it includes a number of measures that will make it easier for people to buy their first homes, such as a rent-to-own plan,” says Mr. Van Bynen. “We’ll also ban blind-bidding and introduce a temporary ban on new foreign ownership of homes. “As something that can be done almost immediately [locally], I think banning blind bidding will make a big difference. If you’re buying a home, you should be able to know what other bids have been placed. I’ve often heard a lot of stories from people who bid far more than would have been required to buy their home simply because they were under the impression that it was necessary to be able to beat other bidders.” The issue of housing is a top-of-mind concern for NDP candidate Yvonne Kelly and one she says is top-of-mind for most people she encounters. Her party, she says, will create “at least 500,000 units of quality, affordable housing” over the next 10 years and establish Fast-Start-Funds to encourage the construction of co-operative, social and non-profit housing, areas she says have been unable to access funding in current strategy and funding programs. “We will convert unused and under-used Federal lands into vibrant communities,” she says. “We will also waive the Federal portion of the GST/HST on construction of new affordable rental units. And for Canadians who are interested in new home ownership options, the NDP will invest resources to facilitate co-housing and new models of co-ownership along with easing access to CMHC-backed co-ownership mortgages. This will offer new and more accessible opportunities for individuals and families to afford housing.” An NDP government, she adds, will fight money-laundering and end speculation that is fuelling high housing prices by implementing a 20 per cent foreign buyers’ tax. “Because we have 12-year waiting lists for housing subsidies and deeply affordable housing in York Region and Newmarket-Aurora specifically, the move to streamlining access to federal funding for the construction of co-ops and not-for-profit homes has the potential to drastically increase the availability of new affordable options for families in the riding in the near future,” she says. “The creation of 500,000 new affordable units across Canada, half of which will kick-start the economic recovery while building the homes that residents of Newmarket-Aurora and elsewhere need and can afford.” Green Party candidate Tim Fleming says affordable housing is a fundamental right for all Canadians and permanent residents and suggests a dedicated Minister of Housing tasked with steering a National Housing Strategy in collaboration with the provinces. “New unit quantification would be financially supported through an expanded co-investment fund built by the needs and standards developed with the provinces,” he says. “Tax incentives would be expanded for purpose-built affordable housing and examine the relief potential for GST for same. There are significantly more changes that could be implemented but it is paramount that the programs be built with inclusive access to all, including the Indigenous fellow Canadians who have a deep need. “The needs of Newmarket-Aurora would be included in any assessment with the federal, provincial and regional and Town governments working quickly together towards an action-driven agenda and fixed deadline before 2023.” AURORA-OAK RIDGES-RICHMOND HILL Canada has a housing crisis, says Conservative candidate Leona Alleslev, with the lowest number of houses per capita in the G7 leaving Canadians finding it “increasingly difficult” to find affordable housing. Money laundering and proceeds from crime, she added, are driving up prices while, at the same time, are “putting homeownership out of reach for more and more Canadians.” “A Conservative government will focus on building a million homes in the next three years,” says Ms. Alleslev. “We will work with our municipalities to build more high-density housing near publicly-funded transit. Our plan will also address unfair practices that have driven the price of houses up, such as money laundering, while also banning foreign investors from buying homes that will be left empty because they have not chosen to move to Canada. “We know the GTA has some of the highest housing prices in Canada – our review of the mortgage stress test will ensure it is fair to all regions of the country. We will also bring new emphasis to the rental market, increasing supply to ensure a stable rental housing market. Under this plan, Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill would see immediate benefit from a Conservative government partnering to invest in high-density homes near our publicly-funded transit stations and through currently vacant foreign-owned homes being made available for owners and renters in our community to live in.” While Liberal candidate Leah Taylor Roy says Aurora is a “great place to live, work and raise a family,’ she says many people, especially young people and families, despite working hard at good jobs, can’t afford a home here. “A re-elected Liberal government will continue to work to make housing more affordable and help more Canadians achieve their dream of owning a home,” she says. “We are already the first government to have a National Housing strategy and have introduced initiatives to help first-time home buyers, but we need to do more.” The party’s plan, she says, includes a new rent-to-own program to help renters become homeowners, help Canadians under 40 save up to $40,000 towards their first home with a tax-free First Home Savings Account, building and repairing 1.4 million more homes over four years, and introducing a buyer’s bill of rights. Asked for quick wins for Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill, she too points to the limits on foreign buyers. “This will help lower inflated prices and give the people of Aurora a fair shot at homeownership,” she says, referring to the “ban on foreign speculation. “We need purpose-built rental housing and planned communities. There are areas on the Yonge Street corridor where new low-rise buildings and communities could replace vacant or old strip malls and provide housing with access to public transportation, essential services and green spaces.” Subject: Conservatism; Bans; Investments; Funding; Profits; Housing prices; Mortgages; Money laundering; Canadians; Tax incentives; Rentals; Affordable housing; Home ownership; Elections"

"2021-09-05","Full text: The Latest: French-language election debate on TVA MONTREAL - The Latest on the French-language leaders' debate airing on TVA among Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet (all times eastern): 10:55 p.m. Taking his turn at the podium, Trudeau sought to clarify his position on whether Canadians would be heading back to the polls quickly should the Sept. 20 election result in a minority government. During the debate, Trudeau said there would likely be another vote in 18 months if Canadians don't elect a majority. But after the televised event, Trudeau said he simply meant that 18 months is the average life span of a minority government, and noted his party has surpassed that milestone. --- 10:40 p.m. O'Toole was pressed on his stance regarding Canada's public health-care system in a news conference after the debate. He highlighted — in both French and English — his proposal to boost health transfers to provinces with no strings attached. O'Toole also vowed to convene the country's premiers within 100 days of his party forming government, in an effort to address health-care gaps exposed by the pandemic. --- 10:35 p.m. Singh says he's against Quebec's secularism law but in favour of the separation of church and state. Singh was asked after the debate how he would overcome the law — which prohibits some public sector worker from wearing symbols such as hijabs and turbans at work — to win over Quebec voters. He said he understands why Quebec wants to limit the influence of religion but doesn't believe in discriminating against people for what they wear. --- 10:15 p.m. Blanchet suggests his party would more effectively represent Quebec's interests in the House of Commons under a minority government. Speaking to reporters after the debate, Blanchet says many of the gains and victories his party achieved since the last federal election were because the Liberals — and to a lesser degree, the Opposition Conservatives — had to compromise. He also suggested the Bloc would have done even more if an election hadn't been called so soon. --- 10 p.m. The four leaders made their final pitches to voters after a debate that sparked heated discussions over the pandemic and key issues such as health care and climate change. Trudeau painted his party as experienced and ambitious, and ready to continue the work of pulling Canada out of the COVID-19 crisis. Singh vowed to tackle the housing and climate change crises, which he said had worsened under the Liberals, and to make life more affordable for Canadians. O'Toole, meanwhile, emphasized his willingness to respect provincial jurisdiction on matters such as immigration, and his plan to boost health transfers. Blanchet most pointedly targeted a Quebec audience with promises to defend the province's interests in Parliament. --- 9:40 p.m. Trudeau defended his record on climate change as it came under fire from Singh and O'Toole, who noted Canada has missed its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Liberals. The NDP leader added that Canada has the worst results on emissions of all the G7 countries, and accused Trudeau of not delivering on his environmental promises. Trudeau pushed back, saying the measures implemented under his watch will lead Canada to exceed the targets set under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. He then turned the tables on O'Toole, accusing him of seeking to roll back the country's progress by reverting back to the targets established under Harper. --- 9:15 p.m. Speaking directly to the camera, O’Toole accused Trudeau of a lack of leadership when it comes to protecting female members of the Canadian Forces from sexual harassment. O’Toole says Trudeau’s office ""camouflaged"" allegations that former chief of the defence staff Jonathan Vance acted inappropriately towards female subordinates and asked Trudeau if he regretted giving Vance a salary increase after the allegations were made. Trudeau responded that his government is following the processes in place and that investigations need to be handled independently. Trudeau has said he did not personally know about a complaint against Vance that was disclosed to the Prime Minister's Office in 2018, and his staff did not know the details of the allegation. Vance was charged with one count of obstruction of justice last month following an investigation into allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. He has denied any wrongdoing and not been charged in connection with those allegations. O’Toole says there needs to be zero tolerance for harassment and sexual misconduct by senior military officers. --- 9 p.m. The debate has revived a year-old dispute between Singh and Blanchet over the NDP leader calling a Bloc MP a racist. Singh was removed from the House of Commons for the remark in June of last year, which came after Alain Therrien blocked a New Democrat motion to recognize systemic racism in the RCMP. The Bloc has said it was already supporting a study of systemic racism in police forces, including the RCMP, at the Commons public safety committee and did not want to draw conclusions before the work had even begun. Blanchet pressed Singh to apologize for the comment during the debate, prompting Singh to launch into an explanation for his actions. The pair spoke over each other repeatedly, with Singh saying Therrien had made a dismissive gesture. Blanchet said he took issue with someone being accused a racist for disagreeing with a motion in a Parliament specifically created for debating motions. --- 8:50 p.m. An animated Trudeau repeatedly pressed O'Toole about whether he would expand private heath care in Quebec. It's a familiar attack from the Liberal leader who has criticized his Tory opponent during the campaign for saying he supports provinces giving patients choice. Last week Liberal Chrystia Freeland tweeted an edited video from O'Toole's leadership run in which he talked about his support for private, for-profit medical services within Canada's public health care system, but cut out his proviso that universal access must remain ""paramount.'' The Conservative leader defended himself from Trudeau's attacks by saying the video in question was flagged by Twitter as manipulated media and he's promising to spend billions more on universal health care. --- 8:40 p.m. Trudeau is once again facing accusations of interfering in provincial matters as the leaders face off on their plans for long-term care. Nursing and seniors' homes bore the brunt of the first and second waves of the pandemic, accounting for most of the country's deaths and prompting Ottawa to send in the military to homes in Ontario and Quebec. When asked whether he would support national standards for nursing homes, Blanchet says he disagrees with the belief that rules coming out of Ottawa are better than those created in Quebec. Trudeau says he wants to work in partnership with the provinces while respecting their jurisdiction over health care. O'Toole, meanwhile, touted his campaign promise to increase health transfers to provinces with no strings attached. He says Trudeau's approach, which includes targeted health funding, is paternalistic — not a partnership. Singh says he wouldn't stand idly by as residents in long-term care suffer. --- 8:20 p.m. Federal party leaders traded barbs over mandatory vaccinations early in the debate. Trudeau says he's not interested in forcing people to get vaccinated, but limiting the privileges of those who choose not to get the shot. He attacked Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole for not requiring his candidates to get vaccinated. O'Toole says he believes the country can find reasonable accommodations for those who are unvaccinated, like rapid testing and social distancing. O'Toole talked about how he and his wife, Rebecca, contracted COVID-19. The Tory leader says he respects Quebec Premier Francois Legault's decision to introduce a vaccine ""passport"" QR code to allow those who are immunized access to non-essential businesses. --- 8:10 p.m. The pandemic is the first theme of the debate, with Blanchet pressing Trudeau on his reasons for triggering an election as the fourth wave gained momentum. Blanchet raises the risks of campaigning at this time, and suggests Trudeau has been breaching public health measures while taking selfies in close quarters with members of the public while out on the hustings. He asks whether Trudeau would have sent voters to the polls at this time if he had a majority government. Trudeau says now is the time for the federal government to make big decisions and Canadians need to be given the chance to weigh in — a similar answer to what he's given throughout the campaign when pressed on this issue. --- 7:40 p.m. The four leaders taking part in tonight's debate have arrived at the TVA studio, where they were welcomed by several dozen protesters and a heavy police presence. Most of the demonstrators were carrying flags for the Unifor and CUPE unions, though they were also joined by protesters from environmental groups. As they walked in, the leaders were greeted by Pierre Karl Péladeau, chief executive of Quebecor, which controls the network's owner Groupe TVA. The debate, which is the first of the election campaign, is set to begin at 8 p.m. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 2, 2021.

"2021-09-04","Full text: With the federal election fast approaching, Town & Country News spoke with the candidates in our Grande Prairie-Mackenzie riding. New Democratic Party of Canada - Jennifer Villebrun Jennifer Villebrun has put her foot into the race as the NDP candidate for Grande Prairie-Mackenzie. Villebrun, a long-time Valleyview resident, has worked as a lawyer and is now a school teacher in High Prairie. “I've always been interested in politics right from the time I was a young girl, and I think one of the things that has drawn me to it, is that I see so many opportunities where I feel our government could be doing better,” she told the News. Villebrun is no stranger to politics as she ran for office in the Peace River-Westlock riding in 2019, under the NDP banner and lost to CPC candidate Arnold Viersen. She has also worked with non-profit organizations advocating for government resources and with groups such as Habitat for Humanity. “Many people I encounter in our region are struggling to live affordably (with) the cost of housing, the cost of childcare … all of those things are really putting a financial burden on the people and then it's only been amplified over the last 18 months with a pandemic,” she said. “The policies regarding housing support, childcare, pharmacare, things like making sure that workers have paid sick leave, to me, those are hugely important things that need to be emphasized in this area.” She said the NDP also wants to help rebuild the economy. “I think that the NDP has some really great ideas. ""They want to focus on rebuilding manufacturing industries and attracting industries, such as the auto industry back into Canada and helping build those so that we have a diverse economy.” She noted that oil and gas and the forestry sectors are crucial parts of the economy but said she hopes to see those expand so that new possibilities can happen in the area. If elected, she wants to have a more hands-on approach to representing the community, something she says is missing. “I want to meet with the people,” said Villebrun. “I want to know what their concerns are at the end of the day. “I really do think that Jagmeet Singh (NDP national leader) is someone who has done a lot for Canadians in the past few years, through his role in the House. “The NDP pushed hard to increase access to CERB and wage subsidies over the last 18 months. “They really focused a lot on the reality that people in our communities need help with affordability and the policies that the NDP developed really reflect the real lives of people.” In a previous issue of Town & Country News, we spoke with Grande Prairie-Mackenzie candidates: CPC candidate Chris Warkentin, PPC candidate Shawn McLean and Maverick candidate Ambrose Ralph."

The French debate on T-V-A, one of Quebec's most-watched networks, could prove crucial to the outcome on September 20th. The T-V-A debate was seen as pivotal for the Liberals in the 2019 campaign when then-Conservative leader Andrew Scheer avoided issues of abortion and medical assistance in dying.

The chamber says Canada is missing a ``major opportunity'' to be a world power in producing the minerals and rare-earth elements that power everything from cellphones to electric cars. So far, the federal election campaign has been devoid of any serious discussion about the issue.

The province reported 13-hundred and 15 new COVID-19 cases yesterday, the highest one-day total since mid-May, along with eight more deaths. Alberta has been averaging more than one-thousand new cases a day for the last week. Premier Jason Kenney's government has been silent for weeks on what -- if anything -- it will do, but said earlier this summer that rising case numbers were to be expected.

The province's chief public health officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, says residents of long-term care and community care facilities are at high risk of serious outcomes related to the novel coronavirus. Morrison says although the vaccination rate among residents is high, there are some facilities in which the staff vaccination rate is too low.

The suspects, all German men aged 22 to 27, are accused of breaking into the Green Vault Museum and stealing 21 pieces of jewelry with a total insured value of at least 135-million dollars. Searches so far have not yielded the missing treasures. The Green Vault is one of the world's oldest museums and contains the treasury of Augustus the Strong of Saxony, comprising around four-thousand objects of gold and precious stones.

"2021-09-04","Full text: On Sept. 8 and 9, up to 100 debates on the environment will take place across Canada, giving voters a chance to see where their candidates stand on environmental policy. 100 Debates for the Environment, organized by GreenPAC, aims to facilitate as many non-partisan all-candidate debates as possible to draw attention to environmental issues. So far, there are 75 confirmed debates in eight provinces. The snap election has made organizing more challenging, but GreenPAC executive director Sarah Van Exan said if anything, the number of debates organized on such a short timeline shows how much Canadians want to see climate and environment taken seriously this election. “I think Canadians have tuned into the fact that there's an urgency to solving the climate crisis,” said Van Exan. “This election is one that cannot be wasted in terms of driving good leadership on that front.” This will be the second time the 100 Debates event has run. During the 2019 election, GreenPAC and Équiterre partnered to put on 104 debates with the participation of over 400 candidates — 87 of whom were elected to office. (This year, Équiterre is not involved.) The event was “a game-changer,” said Van Exan. Having 87 officials elected in 2019 who understood that a segment of their constituents expected environmental leadership and were prepared to be held accountable was a victory, she explained. “It broke through the noise of that election campaign, it forced parties and candidates to stop and spend time preparing for these local conversations.” This year, some of those candidates elected in 2019 will be partaking in the debates again, including incumbent Liberal candidate and Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who will participate in a debate on Wednesday. “GreenPAC, essentially, is about highlighting some of the key environmental issues that are facing this country, which I think are a concern to the vast majority of Canadians,” Wilkinson said. Providing a forum for voters to make informed decisions and for candidates to clearly communicate their policy plans are key, he added. Laurel Collins, another returning debate participant and the NDP's environment and climate change critic, said hundreds of people attended the 2019 debate in Victoria, B.C. “It was such an important conversation for community members to hear from candidates about this critically important issue,” said Collins. “It's so critical that candidates hear from community members about the issues that are most important to them.” Fifty-two per cent of Canadians are extremely concerned or quite concerned about climate change, according to a recent national public opinion survey from Abacus Data. Julia Levin, senior program manager for climate and energy at the advocacy group Environmental Defence, says events like these can help bridge the gap between voters and candidates. “It can be hard for voters to distinguish between climate platforms, and it's really important for voters to have ways to let parties know what their expectations are,” said Levin. “These debates can do both of those things.” According to Van Exan, there are still organizers trying to set up debates in their ridings before Sept. 8. It’s not yet clear how many candidates from each party are participating in 2021. In 2019, 96 candidates were from the Green Party, 94 were Liberal, 89 were NDP, and 20 were Bloc Québécois. Only 42 Conservative candidates participated in the debates, compared to 45 candidates from the People's Party of Canada (PPC), which continues to deny the existence of climate change. This year, the PPC does not qualify to participate under the policy direction of the federal leaders' debates commission, but Van Exan said individual organizers “may decide to invite the PPC, independents, or candidates from other parties at their discretion.” Canadians can watch the debates virtually and view a full list of participating ridings. Right now, the number one thing individuals can do to tackle the climate crisis is to get involved and push for political action, said Levin. “The fact that you can have 100 ridings — or however many they're at — across the country talking about the climate crisis is a really powerful message,” she said. “When we see people mobilize as a community, that's powerful, and that's exactly what we need to let decision-makers know that they'll be held accountable, they can't get away with weak climate plans, and that this is a key issue for Canadians.” Subject: Canadians; Community; Debates; Climate change; Public opinion surveys; Elections"
"2021-09-04","Full text: St. John's municipal candidate faces death threats ST. JOHN'S, N.L. - Non-binary Canadian politicians past and present are speaking out against death threats and harassment faced by a transgender woman running in the St. John's, N.L., municipal election who, if elected, will make provincial history. Ophelia Ravencroft is running in the downtown St. John's electoral district of Ward 2, after finishing second in a byelection last October for the same seat. But this time, her campaign looks much different. Though she had been widely known for her social media posts about policy, accessibility, affordability and inclusion in the city, Ravencroft's Twitter and Facebook presence has been muted in the past months. And unlike in October, there are few of her signature purple-and-black lawn signs around the city. On Monday, she and her campaign manager, Shaye Murray, made a post on Twitter explaining why. Ravencroft, her campaign and the larger transgender community had been the target of ""very graphic"" death threats, both online and in person, to the degree that she was worried her supporters would be targeted, too, she said. ""We felt that our current and prospective supporters deserve to have a sense of what was going on,"" Ravencroft said in a recent interview. ""It's been a couple of months of this now. I'm trying to take my life back, and I'm trying to take my campaign back, and I'm here for the people of the ward. I'm committed to this the same way that I was when I declared for the byelection … that dedication hasn't gone away."" A spokesperson for the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary confirmed Wednesday that an investigation into the threats is ongoing. Ravencroft works in public policy and said she first decided to run for municipal politics because she wants the city to better serve its residents. ""I was annoyed that I couldn't walk around in the winter,"" she said. ""I was annoyed that my friends who have accessibility needs, not having those needs met … I was annoyed that we had an affordable housing crisis."" She lost a byelection for the Ward 2 seat in October by 306 votes to Shawn Skinner, a former cabinet minister with the provincial Progressive Conservatives. Skinner isn't running again. If Ravencroft wins on Sept. 28, she'll be the first openly transgender and openly non-binary elected official in the province, and one of just a few openly non-binary people elected to public office across Canada. Uzoma Asagwara, an openly non-binary elected official in the Manitoba legislature for the NDP, says people from marginalized communities and genders need to be supported by those around them who have more power and privilege. Elected officials in Newfoundland and Labrador — at the municipal or provincial level — need to speak up and condemn what's happening to Ravencroft, Asagwara said. ""These situations are a literal matter of life and death,"" Asagwara said in an interview Wednesday. ""When people — especially people in positions of power and privilege and platform — are silent, that is clearly communicating permission for those who are inflicting violence on others to continue doing so. Silence actually sends a very clear message."" Estefan Cortes-Vargas was elected to the Alberta legislature in 2015 with the NDP and came out as non-binary after winning. ""We as trans and non-binary individuals belong in a political space just as much as everyone else,"" Cortes-Vargas said in an interview Wednesday. ""We are here, and we will continue to be here … and every political level should affirm that."" The City of St. John's posted a statement to its social media platforms on Wednesday condemning the harassment. ""We need people to run for council and they should feel safe in doing so,"" the statement said. ""We must all stand together to end this behaviour."" Mayor Danny Breen did not respond to a request for comment. Deputy Mayor Sheilagh O'Leary said she responded to Ravencroft's social media post, offering support. Cortes-Vargas, who uses they/them pronouns, said they had the support of their party when they ran. They added that the threats made against Ravencroft could provide an opportunity for St. John's and other cities in the province to figure out how to better support and protect candidates in municipal elections. Ravencroft said though the harassment has impacted how she has chosen to run her campaign, she said she hopes things will change, especially after the massive swell of community support that arose when she went public. ""Please don't let this dissuade you,"" she said to queer, transgender and non-binary people hoping to follow in her footsteps. ""Look at how many people spoke out in support of me when they realized what was happening, and then understand that no matter where you are, you will have an army like that behind you, too.""

"2021-09-04","Full text: The latest federal election didn’t come as a surprise to Omar Alghabra. The Mississauga Centre candidate is Peel’s most senior federal incumbent and was a key member of Justin Trudeau’s cabinet. Until February, he sat on the procedure and house affairs committee, which dedicated hours to gaming out the possibility of a pandemic election. Alghabra was raising the idea of a snap poll as early as October 2020. Speaking in a debate, the Liberal teased a snap election as the consequence of not supporting his party and government. “If the opposition sticks to the fact that it has no confidence in the government, it will lead to an election,” Alghabra said. “What holds more accountability than an election? We do not want an election, but the actions of the opposition have consequences.” The democratic process was a theme that ran through Alghabra’s speeches and contributions to Canada’s 43rd Parliament. If, as he threatened in his comments, the election had been called at the end of 2020, Alghabra would be seeking reelection as a backbencher. Instead, he is knocking on doors in Mississauga with a much higher profile, as the latest transportation minister. The Mississauga Centre candidate has, through several speeches in Parliament, cleverly matched the city he represents with his new portfolio. As transportation minister, Alghabra has been in charge of railways, ports and the aviation sector. His portfolio has bled into health during the pandemic, infrastructure, city building and even housing. All are issues his riding has been grappling with for more than a year. Mississauga is also home to Toronto Pearson Airport, Canada’s busiest international travel hub and hosts thousands of aviation and transportation-related jobs located in the surrounding area. Many of those jobs felt the impacts of COVID-19, as industries grappled with travel restrictions and global closures that decimated the demand for leisure and business travel. “Mr. Speaker, as the member of Parliament for Mississauga Centre, where many employees of the aviation sector live and work, I am very much in touch with them, and the anxiety they are going through today due to the COVID pandemic,” Alghabra said in February. His February speech was one of only a few times he mentioned his home city by name. According to records on the House of Commons website, Alghabra only made 62 interventions in the parliamentary chamber over the past two years. He made 165 interventions in committee. The Pointer found few direct references to Mississauga Centre in his Hansard records, which show the MP speaking in his cabinet post and as a Liberal Party member more than as a representative of residents in Mississauga Centre. Mississauga Centre is being contested by Teneshia Samuel for the NDP and Kathy-Ying Zhao for the Conservatives. Craig Laferriere is the Green Party candidate and Elie Diab will represent the People’s Party of Canada. Alghabra’s party loyalty plays out in his uniform voting record. Even at times when multiple Liberal MPs chose to vote in favour of opposition motions or legislation, Alghabra stuck with the direction of his party. In May, for example, Marilène Gill (Bloc Québécois) saw the second reading of her legislation to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act pass with the support of the Green Party, NDP, Bloc, Conservative Party and independents. While 139 Liberals voted against it, 10 opted to vote in favour. Alghabra was not one of those to break ranks. This loyalty cuts to the heart of how Alghabra views the role of an MP. He does not see public dissent as a constructive approach to representation, preferring to hash out policy debates in private. “My job is to carry the voice of my constituents to Ottawa and to our government and to be the voice on behalf of my constituents at the table,” Alghabra told The Pointer at a recent event in Mississauga-Streetsville. “There are a lot of the discussions that happen at the table that are not reported on publicly because that’s the way we need to be able to have an honest conversation internally, and to be able to debate and to figure out the right policies.” Alghabra’s elevation to cabinet capped off a varied resume, where he has gained increasing importance behind the scenes. During the 2015 and 2019 Liberal majority, he worked as an assistant to the minister of foreign affairs for three years, before assisting the minister of international trade diversification from 2018 until parliament was dissolved. He worked as the parliamentary assistant to the prime minister on public service renewal from December 2019 during the most recent Parliament, until he was given his own cabinet mandate. His interest in national and international issues, moving beyond the detail of public local advocacy, is reflected in the words Alghabra utters in parliament. Early in 2020, he spoke several times about international trade, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Chinese-Canadian relations. In April and May, his focus moved to committee discussions around how parliament might operate virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic. He was central to pandemic election conversations the following November. Alghabra’s focus shifted noticeably after his appointment to cabinet. He relinquished his position on the procedure and house affairs committee, throwing himself into transportation. Under his watch, the government negotiated a deal with Air Canada to help refund passengers whose flights were cancelled because of the pandemic and navigated the thorny issue of land and sea ports in a world dominated by COVID-19. “We understand that the pandemic has been hard on everyone,” Alghabra said in his last speech before Parliament was dissolved and an election called. “This is why we made significant progress in securing refunds for Canadians. My colleague knows about the deal that we have signed with Air Canada and Air Transat, and we are working on signing other deals with other airlines to ensure that passengers receive the refunds they deserve. We are committed to Canadian passengers.” Alghabra also spent tens of thousands of dollars on expenses during the past Parliament. The $44,340.63 he spent on contracts between January and March 2021 was in the top 20 percent of contract expenditures for all MPs. A regular expense incurred by Alghabra over the past two years has been for a “subject matter expert” from Fadi Younes Consultancy LTD at around $2,000. On January 25, the MP’s office also hired a communications officer from the same agency for $5,000. He spent a lot of the past two years dealing in public with the big picture. He waited until the dying days of the Liberal minority to announce a plan with the potential to transform his Mississauga community. Likely cognisant an election was imminent and keen to motivate residents to send him back to Ottawa, Alghabra promised the funds to bring subway-style service to the Milton GO Train line. The route, which runs through multiple areas in Mississauga, is owned by Canadian Pacific Railways and only runs a handful of commuter trains per day. The cost of increasing the frequency of service has, in the past, been pegged at billions of dollars. On August 10, Alghabra made an announcement in his dual role as local member of parliament and transportation minister. He said the federal government would fund 50 percent of the cost of two-way, all-day GO on the line. The details are yet to be ironed out, including a finalized proposal from Ontario transit agency Metrolinx and support from the Province, but Alghabra values the project at around $1 billion, and says Metrolinx plans to build an additional track alongside CP Railways’ line. Just two days later, and three days before the election was officially called, Alghabra was campaigning using the announcement. He stood at Erindale GO station in Mississauga with a team of Liberal campaigners, promoting the newly announced federal policy as a reason to support the Liberal Party of Canada. With one eye on an election most suspected was coming, Alghabra is teasing the benefits of his most ambitious promise, a transformative legacy project, as something that will only be delivered if voters return him and the Liberals to Ottawa. It’s a quid-pro-quo to convince constituents he, and his government, deserve a third chance to deliver. “The only way I see this not coming is, well, I mean if we change government too at the federal government during this election or if the Province of Ontario doesn’t come through,” he said.

"2021-09-04","Full text: Is it just me, or is this federal election bumbling along as if more than 30,000 people haven’t died of COVID-19, toxic drugs and a historic heat wave in the last 18 months? We know paying people to stay home when they’re sick saves lives. There is a mountain of evidence that providing regulated drugs to replace the criminalized supply stops drug poisoning deaths. And heat waves don’t have to be fatal if emergency management mobilizes to support the most marginalized, who are the most endangered by extreme heat. But over the years, governments have dragged their feet on solutions. A couple of months ago, drug user activist and journalist Garth Mullins offered an interesting framework to understand the government’s response to increasing overdose deaths — Necropolitics. It’s a concept coined by philosopher Achille Mbembe to describe the political and economic calculations that make some lives disposable and others not. Governments assign more value to some human lives than others, and that calculus determines the policies they implement (or don’t). The pandemic made these calculations clear. The people who are dying of COVID-19 are overwhelmingly elderly, disabled, poor, people of colour and Indigenous people and racialized essential workers. Their deaths are often tagged as “tragic” and “heartbreaking.” They’re talked about as if they’re inevitable — but they aren’t. These deaths were the results of choices. Our federal parties and politicians need to make better ones. Provincial leadership aside, federal powers under the Emergencies Act could have saved lives by keeping people home, or at least stopped wealthy Canadians who escaped to sandy beaches from bringing the virus home. Ottawa could have limited mobility as people continued to travel within Canada and spread the virus, or declared minimum national rules for pandemic controls like masking, testing and isolating. But the prime minister refused. This election, I’m watching for promises that recognize the power the federal government has to save lives. That would include serious spending to ensure access to the social determinants of health that keep people safe and well long before there is a crisis — affordable housing, good employment, preventative health care, freedom from racism, queerphobia, sexism, ageism and ableism. Both the NDP and the Greens want to expand public health care to include prescription drugs and more extended health services. The Conservatives also say they will spend more to support provinces with more mental health services and offer incentives for employers to provide mental health coverage. Ten paid sick days for federally regulated workers — barely more than six per cent of the workforce — as the Liberals have proposed, will also help keep people well as COVID-19 continues to surge in Canada, particularly among the unvaccinated. These are great first steps. But health and mental health are financial and social issues too. We need to see commitments to end legislated poverty and systemic racism, and to build accountability at all levels of government. You can’t therapy your way out of oppression and discrimination. Just like you can’t address drug policy deaths without naming the problem. It is clear from all the parties’ platforms that none understand the intricate reality of the toxic drug crisis when they’re still calling it an “opioid crisis.” Opioids aren’t the only poisoned drugs killing people, and bad drug policy is still much more to blame than the substances themselves. Decriminalizing drugs would begin to undo the racist and colonial underpinnings of Canadian drug policy, destigmatize substance use and save lives. But the Liberal government has failed to approve Vancouver’s relatively modest decriminalization proposal eight months after it was submitted. Providing a safe supply of regulated alternatives to the street supply, which the Greens and NDP want to do, would save lives tonight, and every night afterwards, because people would know what they are taking and how much. Treatment, which all parties have committed to expand, is important for those who would like to begin recovery, but it cannot bring back the dead. These are all paramount changes. And yes, none is a silver bullet (if you know of one, please let me know!). But the solutions are not as complicated as the last several years of federal handwringing would make you believe. The next government, like every government, has a chance to save lives. Ignoring that opportunity could be even more fatal next time. Additional readings reeled in from around the web. Reimagining Elder Care: Long-term care was in shambles long before the pandemic, and parties are all posturing about how to fix it. But that it was in such a sorry state in the first place signals how Canada fails elders and family caregivers alike, and the ableism and ageism the system is rooted in. André Picard’s book Neglected No More is essential reading on how we can reimagine elder care in Canada, beyond long-term care."

Local radio personality Bruce Wylie will be moderating the debate. 100 Debates on the Environment was launched by the non-profit group GreenPac in 2019. The purpose of this non-partisan project is to get candidates talking about environmental concerns and policy. This year, the environmental concern is coupled with how the country will continue to address and recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Across the country, there will be 100 Debates on the Environment events in, you guessed it, approximately 100 ridings. The questions will be focused on four topics: the link between environmental concerns and the pandemic; marginalized groups and a just recovery; the Canadian Environmental Protection Act; and indigenous rights and environmental solutions. At each local event, candidates are expected to respond to these questions in ways that are most relevant in their riding."

"2021-09-03","Full text: Liberals highlight policy differences with Tories OTTAWA - Justin Trudeau aimed Wednesday to distinguish the Liberals from Erin O'Toole's Conservatives with promises to enshrine abortion services in the Canada Health Act and toughen measures to ban an array of firearms. The pledges came in a Liberal re-election platform with $78 billion in new spending, more than three times the direct new revenues promised over the next five years. During a campaign stop in Toronto, Trudeau called the platform a detailed and responsible plan that would chart a course out of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""This is the plan that Canada needs to be even more ambitious,"" he said. ""These are the things that allow Canada to move forward, and that's the choice I'm putting forward to Canadians right now."" O'Toole and the NDP's Jagmeet Singh, meanwhile, chided the Liberals for making big promises but not following through with action. ""I want to remind folks the Liberals have taken this strategy again and again,"" Singh said. ""Why deliver on things when you can just campaign on it anyways? Why get things done when you can just promise it?"" O'Toole outlined a plan to build key infrastructure, end delays and get shovels in the ground for world-class public transit, roads and 5G telecom networks. He accused the Liberals of sitting on billions of unspent money. ""Justin Trudeau loves making promises,"" O'Toole said in Ottawa. ""He's had years of announcing and reannouncing the money he planned to spend. But six years later, he has little to show for it."" Trudeau accentuated policies that set him apart from the Conservatives, emphasizing the Liberal plan to work with the provinces toward $10-a-day child care and ensure federal public servants and people travelling by plane or train are vaccinated against COVID-19. The Liberal leader tried to put even more policy distance between himself and O'Toole with the new platform promises on guns and abortion. In 2020 the Liberals banned the use, sale and importation of more than 1,500 models of what they consider assault-style weapons. Legislation introduced last February proposed a buyback of these firearms, with owners allowed to keep them under strict conditions including registration and secure storage of the guns. The Liberal platform suggests the bill, which died at the election call, would be amended to make it mandatory for owners of the banned weapons to either sell them back to the government or have them rendered inoperable at the government's expense. The bill also would have given municipalities the power to ban handguns. The Liberals are now saying they would expand that authority to entire provinces or territories, a plan that still falls short for those who wanted a truly national ban to avoid a patchwork of handgun laws. The Liberals have earmarked $1 billion to help provinces that move to ban handguns in 2022. The Conservative election platform says the party would scrap the May 2020 ban on a wide variety of guns and review the Firearms Act with input from police, gun owners, manufacturers and the public. On abortion, the Liberals plan to leave no room for doubt it is a medically necessary procedure under the Canada Health Act by including it in a regulation. The promise comes after New Brunswick saw its health transfer payments clawed back by about $140,000 this year for charging fees for abortion at a private clinic. ""Canada is a country where we stand up for women's rights,"" Trudeau said. ""And I will not allow others to limit those rights."" Singh campaigned in Quebec, where his party is hoping to boost its seat count following a dismal showing in the last federal election.

"2021-09-03","Full text: Shields readying for fall election By Kenyon Stronski Local Journalism Initiative Reporter We’re nearing the halfway point of this short 36 day snap election call with politics heating up all over Canada. Martin Shields, Conservative Member of Parliament for the Bow River constituency commented on how it’s hard to get out and meet all the communities within his riding in such a short period of time. “The election is five weeks, which is very short and the minimum length it can be. I don’t really feel the stress because we’ve been out in the communities during the summer and are year-round. Although in a large rural riding with 60 communities, it is very hard to get to all the communities in this very short period of time. So that’s the challenge. We’ve been in those communities prior to the election being called and during the year, so it’s not new to us to get around but to get it all done in five weeks is a challenge. The Conservative Party has been closing in on the Liberal Party, and Shields believes that it’s because people have finally begun to see and listen to Conservative Party Leader Erin O’Toole. “They are listening to him. His message is very clear and he’s providing a very good one. He doesn’t wander off into extremes and he’s very straight-forward with this platform and people are beginning to see there are a lot of good things in the platform and I think people have begun to realize how well he speaks when presenting it.” At this point, the Liberals don’t currently have a platform, while the Conservatives have a thorough platform that has been out since the election started. Shields commented on how many people didn’t believe the election was good timing, as Canada is suffering from droughts, forest fires, and still the ever-present and steadily re-igniting threat of COVID. “There has been a lot of people that I have met that don’t understand why an election was called at this time.” Having such a short election time makes it hard for voters to know the ins and outs of all the parties running. However, Shields hopes that even within this short time frame people can see the differences between the Conservative and Liberal parties and still make an educated choice. Shields has plans to visit all 60 communities within the Bow River riding and appeared at Cornfest this past weekend. Subject: Political parties"
"2021-09-03","Full text: SDSG – Ottawa construction worker Trevor Kennedy has been chosen by the party as the local NDP candidate in Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry. The local NDP riding association had been struggling to select a candidate in the riding since the snap election call on August 15. Local riding officials had announced last week that they had selected a candidate and that person was undergoing the veting process by the national party. That process was stopped by the national party over the weekend. The riding association said on Facebook that there was a local candidate but the vetting and acclamation process could not be completed by the Elections Canada deadline. The candidate nomination period closed August 30 at 2 p.m. Any political party can override the local riding association and select a candidate to run for the party in a riding, a process that is called parachuting. The party said that Kennedy is a “huge Jagmeet supporter and wants to use his voice to support the NDP values and platform.” Kennedy is returning to school this fall in the construction trades.

"2021-09-03","Full text: On August 15, 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a snap election, to be held on September 20. Though many disapprove of Trudeau’s timing, the election is upon us. With just 20 days until voting day, it is time to get informed, carefully consider one’s options, and then participate in the democratic process. The federal election process in Canada can be broken down into six major steps. The first of these steps is, as we saw on August 14, dropping the writ. Justin Trudeau asked Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve Parliament. Her Excellency then directs the Chief Electoral Officer to issue the writs, triggering Elections Canada into action. The second step is the nomination and confirmation of candidates. Political parties choose candidates to run in each riding. Or, independent candidates with no party affiliation choose to run. Eligible nominated candidates must then collect electors’ signatures to be confirmed on the ballot. Each candidate must provide Elections Canada with at least 100 valid signatures from voters in their riding stating that they consent to their candidacy. Step three is perhaps the most visible step to voters: the campaign. Candidates attend debates, canvas by phone or foot, promote their platforms, take interviews, and so on. In this year’s federal election, this process is not only extremely fast paced, but limited due to ongoing concerns surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic."

"2021-09-03","Full text: Canada’s National Observer asked federal NDP environment and climate change critic Laurel Collins about key issues in the upcoming federal election, and how Canada can respond to the climate crisis. (This interview has been edited for brevity.) What is the No. 1 issue facing Canadians during this upcoming term? The issue I have been working on the most, and that is always top of mind for me, is the climate crisis and protecting the environment. Canadians are seeing record heat waves, smoke from climate fires, displacement, flooding, extreme weather, and it is terrifying. It is devastating to see the impacts on communities. What other issues are also going to be extremely pressing during the election? We need head-to-toe universal health care. Universal health care should include essential medication, dental care, vision, hearing, and it definitely should include mental health care. Canadians are wanting to see their government really put health care first, and that includes public long-term care facilities. We saw the devastation that happened in long-term care facilities, especially in privatized long-term care where our loved ones and many elderly folks who were dealing with horrible conditions died unnecessarily. We also think Canadians want their government to create a future where life is affordable and where the wealthiest pay their fair share. We are seeing completely unaffordable rents and housing prices and people can't afford to live in the community they grew up in. This is because of a lack of leadership from our federal government. We, as New Democrats, are committed to building 500,000 new affordable units and making sure those are green buildings. We've committed to a 20 per cent foreign buyers tax on top of provincial ones to ensure we're actually dealing with the root causes of high housing prices, one of which is speculative investment. And, I think, especially right now as this country has been rocked by the uncovering of mass graves at residential “schools” and where Indigenous communities are being retraumatized after every discovery, it is so essential that our federal government stops just talking about reconciliation and actually does the work. That means implementing the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. That means implementing the calls for justice from the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls report. It means actually investing in Indigenous communities, ensuring housing on reserves is safe and affordable, and that urban Indigenous folks have access to housing. We also have huge inequalities when it comes to racialized communities, which are disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis. When we are talking about climate solutions and investments in cities, we need to bring the lens of equity and justice. When it comes to climate, where should Canada concentrate its efforts coming out of such a disastrous summer? Right now, our targets are not ambitious enough. The IPCC report says globally we need to cut our emissions in half from 2005 levels by 2030, and Canada has refused to put our target in line with the top global scientists’ recommendations. The NDP would create a national crisis strategy and Climate Corps of young workers to help communities reduce and respond to climate risks. Another one of the big changes that needs to happen is to make sure we have carbon budgeting. This has worked in the U.K. and in New Zealand, year after year, to bring down emissions. We are the only G7 country whose emissions have risen since signing the Paris Agreement. We are clearly headed in the wrong direction, and our government continues to reassure us that we're headed in the right direction. What is Canada's path to net-zero emissions? The NDP has a plan to create one million new good jobs to help rebuild local economies, while at the same time supporting vulnerable workers. We need to be investing in green infrastructure projects, we need to be building green affordable housing, and we need to be investing in transit infrastructure. Buildings are the third-highest emitters of greenhouse gases in Canada after the fossil fuel industry and transportation, so building heating and cooling is one of the areas we can make a huge impact. We have a commitment to retrofit all buildings in Canada by 2050. Transportation is another area where we can create really good jobs, strengthen communities, and reduce our carbon emissions. We have committed to support transit by permanently doubling the Canada Community-Building Fund and building out a public intercity bus program. We are also setting a target of net carbon-free electricity by 2030 and to move to 100 per cent non-emitting electricity by 2040. Does non-green hydrogen produced from gas make sense to the NDP as a climate solution? I have deep concerns about the government providing money to invest in solutions that are oftentimes helping big oil and gas companies expand fossil fuel production. We need climate solutions that are truly on the path to net-zero, and I think there's an important potential in green hydrogen, but we definitely need to be cautious when it comes to the proposals to burn more emissions. What do you think about carbon capture? Is this something we need in our toolbox? I definitely am opposed to the subsidies that have been requested by oil and gas lobbyists for carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery. Until carbon capture is commercially viable, scalable, and directed towards taking carbon out of the atmosphere in a way that is not focused on expanding fossil fuel production, I think we have to be very cautious with relying on these kinds of technologies. How does nuclear energy fit into the equation for you? While we currently have nuclear power in Canada being used as a low-carbon energy source — and we are not proposing to shut those down — we are urgently needing to reduce our emissions before 2030, and many of these new projects require extensive consultation and years of approval processes. We have climate solutions that can reduce our emissions right now, and if we actually invested in retrofitting all of our buildings, invested in wind, solar, geothermal, building out our electricity grid, and creating interprovincial electricity transportation grids, we could make such a huge impact in this most critical decade. What is the most important and time-sensitive step you think Canada needs to take to address the climate crisis? We need our government to make bold investments in tackling the climate crisis — and that means ending fossil fuel subsidies. We spent $18 billion last year in support of the fossil fuel industry. Compared with the $15 billion committed over 10 years by the Liberal government in their climate plan ... the scale at which we are supporting the fossil fuel industry versus the scale at which we are addressing the climate emergency is shameful. Choosing to give out billions of dollars to the fossil fuel industry and profitable oil and gas companies is choosing not to invest money in the climate solutions we so desperately need right now. How does the Coastal GasLink pipeline factor into these issues you’re talking about? We have committed to ending all fossil fuel subsidies, and I think most of the pieces around Coastal GasLink are provincial. But when it comes to federal decisions, we need a federal government that takes the climate crisis seriously and isn't investing in expanding fossil fuel infrastructure and bankrolling big oil and gas companies. How will the NDP ensure working Canadians are supported while the country grapples with a rapidly changing climate and economy? We need a truly just and prosperous transition, and we need our government to be investing in creating good family-sustaining jobs in the low-carbon economy. And that includes all the things we've talked about, like investing in retrofits, investing in transit and transportation mode shifts, in green housing and green infrastructure. These are the kinds of solutions that create good jobs, take care of communities, support workers, and help us reduce our emissions. In 2019, this government promised they would implement a just transition act to support workers, and it was only two weeks before the election that they even launched a consultation about what would be needed for a just transition act. It honestly comes off as disingenuous. No wonder oil and gas workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba are skeptical of this Liberal government. We need a government that invests in climate solutions at the scale that matches the climate emergency. What makes your party best-positioned to tackle the challenge of climate change? The NDP is deeply committed to addressing environmental justice. We need to tackle the climate emergency, we need to protect our environment, and we need to do it in a way that addresses the inequities that exist in our world. Indigenous communities are best placed to lead the fight against the climate crisis, and we have a lot to learn from the knowledge that exists in Indigenous communities. It is key to ensure all of our climate plans are grounded in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. If we forget about fighting for justice and fighting inequality, we will not be effective in tackling the climate crisis. And if we forget about tackling the climate crisis and protecting the environment, we will not be effective in addressing inequalities ... Those two things go hand in hand.

"2021-09-03","Full text: A total of twelve candidates have announced their intentions to run for seats on Wheatland County council in the upcoming October 2021 municipal elections, including five incumbent parties. Current councillors for Division 2 (Reeve Amber Link), Division 3 (Donna Biggar) Division 4 (Tom Ikert), Division 5 (Deputy Reeve Scott Klassen) and Division 6 (Glenn Koester) are running for re-election for a second term in their respective divisions; meanwhile, the seven new candidates announced so far are vying for the soon to be vacant Division 1 and Division 7 seats. Current Division 7 Councillor Ben Armstrong announced earlier this year he will be retiring after 29 years of service. During his time on council, Councillor Armstrong has served as both Reeve and Deputy Reeve of Wheatland County, and is currently the longest serving member of council. With his seat soon to be vacated, two candidates, Einar Davison and Rick Laursen, have announced their intentions to run for Councillor Armstrong’s spot on council. In a press release, Davison, a longtime resident of the Hussar area, stated, “I am confident I can represent Division 7 ratepayers as effectively as Ben did.” Fellow Division 7 candidate Rick Laursen is a longtime resident and has been heavily involved in the community for many years, having plenty of experience, at both a local and national level, on various boards and committees. He currently serves as council president of Our Saviors Community Church in Hussar, and Vice Chair of the Canadian Standards Association committee. “With the retirement of current Councillor Ben Armstrong, I felt prompted to enter the municipal election for the first time and put my extensive experience to use as a councillor,” Laursen tells the Mail. Division 1 Councillor Jason Wilson gave an emotional farewell during the Tuesday, July 6 regular council meeting, thanking his fellow councillors for the privilege to serve with them over the course of his four year term. His fellow council members thanked him for his service to the county and expressed their appreciation for the perspective he brought as the youngest councillor. Wheatland County Reeve Amber Link also thanked him for representing Wheatland County. With Councillor Wilson’s announcement he will not be running for re-election, four new candidates have put their names forward for Division 1, Allen Grant MacLennan, Janet Kanters, Shmorong, Shannon Laprise, and Erich Hoff. MacLennan has prior experience working in previous election campaigns in Calgary, and is familiar with governance at both a local and ministerial level having been involved with developing a ministry project to maintain rural capability, and the community and livelihood of rural life. He says he has concerns with “government overreach” and protecting industry within the county. MacLennan shares there are many families in the area who have lived and worked many acres within the county for generations, and throughout the years numerous bylaw changes have been made which may have unforeseen impacts on these landowners. “This is where we live, and this is where we work,” MacLennan tells the Mail, adding he will have “a tremendous amount of work” ahead of him if elected. Ginette Motta is running for the Division 6 seat alongside incumbent candidate Glenn Koester. Koester was first elected to Wheatland County council in 2003 and, if elected, this term will mark his seventh term on council. The nomination period will remain open until Monday, September 20 at 12 p.m. Subject: Local elections; Councils; City ordinances"

"2021-09-03","Full text: ANTIGONISH – For the past five years, Betsy MacDonald (NDP) has been a communications and outreach officer for the NDP Nova Scotia Caucus, working with organizations, municipal leaders, businesses and other stakeholders in communities across the province. She ran in Central Nova in the most recent federal election in 2019, finishing third behind Liberal Sean Fraser (incumbent) and George Canyon (Conservative). The Journal recently spoke with MacDonald about this run for the federal seat in Central Nova. The NDP, she says, has “a plan that will require the very wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share in our COVID recovery, and in our path to addressing the climate emergency. I think that’s the biggest thing that distinguishes us from the other party.” MacDonald’s background includes working for the Antigonish Women’s Resource Centre & Sexual Assault Services Association and the Coady International Institute. She has also been a freelance writer, researcher and editor based in Antigonish. She holds a development studies and anthropology degree from StFX and a master’s in social justice and equity studies from Brock University. What are your top priorities and why do you think your party is the best choice at this time? “We need a government that's going to take the bold and committed action that’s needed to do our part to bring down global emissions. I feel the NDP has the best plan for ensuring that our recovery is about families and about workers and about the environment. “The difference between the NDP and the other parties – the difference between Jagmeet Singh and the other party leaders – is that Jagmeet does not answer to the rich and powerful. New Democrats do not answer to the rich and powerful. They answer to ordinary people. We have a plan that will require the very wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share in our COVID recovery, and in our path to addressing the climate emergency. I think that’s the biggest thing that distinguishes us from the other party. “Issues that are top priorities for the NDP in this election are universal pharmacare and housing. And so you can expect to hear Jagmeet talking a lot about these issues. And you can expect to hear a lot from me on them as well. “The NDP has a plan to build half-a-million affordable housing units across the country. And we also have a plan to expand our Medicare system to include pharmacare, as well as vision, dental and mental healthcare.” What are you hearing from voters? “I think a lot of people have had climate change on their minds. I think, in particular, a lot of parents are thinking about the climate, because it impacts their children’s future. And I'm one of those parents. I think relatedly there are a number of environmental issues in the riding or near the riding that have people thinking about the quality of our air and our water and our forests, and I'm hearing a lot about that as a candidate. Certainly, the Cochrane Hill gold mine proposal remains top of mind for many residents. As it stands now, we don’t support the project going ahead. It just poses too many risks to the local ecosystem. And there's a clear no from a critical mass of residents. Why are you running in this election? “The number one reason is the climate emergency. That was also my top reason for running last time. The emergency is here, and we’re seeing it in, in the BC wildfires and other extreme weather events around the world. “The other reason I’m running is that, of course, we are coming out of the pandemic. In Canada, we are still living the pandemic in Canada. But as we recover, we need to build a recovery that is people-centered and that creates the good sustainable jobs that are going to transition our economy away from carbon.” Subject: Local elections; Sex crimes; Climate change; Pandemics"

Robert Doucette, who is running for the New Democratic Party in the Saskatoon-West riding, aims to become the first Indigenous MP to represent an urban riding in Saskatchewan. Buckley Belanger, running for the Liberals in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, wants to be a voice on the inside of the government for his northern riding and Indigenous people. Both men are strong candidates with public recognition in the political field, although their choice of federal parties may come as a surprise. Doucette, who has been involved in Métis politics for 30 years, is the former president of the Métis Nation-Saskatchewan and presently is the executive director of the Saskatoon Indian and Métis Friendship Centre. In those positions, he has worked closely with the Liberal government and says he has “felt betrayed as an Indigenous person” by Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett. Doucette draws attention to the exclusion of Métis from the Sixties Scoop Settlement Agreement reached in 2017 despite, he says, Bennett’s promise to include Métis. The Liberals came to power in 2015. It took until this past July for the court to issue a certification order for a similar class action undertaken by Métis and non-status Indians. “There’s lots of examples of why I’m running for the NDP… I want a leader and Jagmeet (Singh) is that person. Where he says, he or she, is going to do something and they actually do do it if they’re given a chance,” said Doucette, who says his personal values align with the NDP and his family has always voted NDP. For Belanger, it’s been a move in the other direction. Although first being elected as a Liberal in 1995, Belanger has served in the Saskatchewan legislature as a member of the NDP since 1998, including as a member of the Cabinet for two NDP premiers. “You’re sitting there as an elected NDPer, a provincial MLA, and you’re frustrated. I could have stayed there for three more years and collected a pay cheque and I just didn’t think that that was something I wanted to continue doing … If (running for the Liberals) was going to move the agenda for my people in my riding and make things a lot better, then it’s important that I keep that in mind,” he said. Belanger says it was his lobbying for his constituents in the northern provincial riding of Athabasca that brought his name and work to the attention of federal Cabinet ministers and resulted in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking him to join his team. Belanger is reluctant to draw parallels between his personal invitation from Trudeau and the personal recruitment of First Nation’s candidate Jody Wilson-Raybould in 2015. Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Liberal caucus in the midst of a political scandal that implicated Trudeau and was re-elected as an independent in 2019; she is not seeking re-election this time around. “I don't know all the particulars and all the circumstances,” he said about Wilson-Raybould. “Any candidate, including me … has to have a team discipline, and that's how you get things done. And sometimes opinions can be very strong from people and lots of times it is difficult to keep the team intact, but I know being in Cabinet in Saskatchewan … you can certainly push your ideas and get your concepts to bring forward changes and if you get the support of the caucus and the Cabinet, you see those changes occur. But ... you still have to have a structure. You’ve got to have a team. You’ve got to have discipline. Those are prerequisites to being a good MP.” Belanger points to Ontario, Quebec, the Atlantic provinces and British Columbia as having representatives within the government. He says Indigenous peoples and the prairie provinces also need representation. There were six Indigenous Liberal MPs elected in 2019. “Instead of sitting at home hoping things happen, I want to be in there to drive the change and speed up the process,” said Belanger. Doucette emphasizes that neither he nor the NDP are running to come in second or third, but he does point to the pivotal role the NDP played in a minority government during the coronavirus pandemic, which included getting the Liberals to double the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) from $1,000 to $2,000 a month and ensuring that small businesses got support. “The NDP kept the Liberals and Conservatives honest in parliament,” he said. A Mainstreet poll of the Saskatoon-West riding from Aug. 21 to Aug. 25 shows the NDP in a tie with the Conservatives, both with 33 per cent support. Doucette says Saskatoon-West has substantial Indigenous, ethnic and diverse populations and if those numbers come out to the polls in strength, they “can have a huge impact in this riding.” He also points out that incumbent Brad Redekopp was one of the 13 of 14 Saskatchewan Conservatives to vote against a bill to ban conversion therapy. That bill died in the Senate because of the election call. Doucette said he has been door-knocking and has heard concerns about housing and the need for the NDP-proposed pharmacare (government-coverage costs for medicine). He stresses he has been following a strict protocol set out by the NDP for campaigning. “A lot of the NDP supporters have said we need to carry forth with the 94 recommendations from the (Truth and Reconciliation Commission on the legacy of Indian residential schools). And also to ensure that the living conditions, the conditions that Indigenous people find themselves in, has to be rectified. And the NDP party has made that a priority,” said Doucette. He underscores Singh’s early stop in the campaign at the Cowessess First Nation and meeting with Chief Cadmus Delorme to bring attention to the unmarked children’s graves found at the former residential school site and the experiences of those who attended residential schools. Doucette is trying to return the Saskatoon-West seat to the NDP who won it in 2015. Beyond the Conservative candidate Redekopp, Doucette is facing three other candidates in his fight: Liberal (Ruben Rajakumar), Green (David Greenfield), and People’s Party (Kevin Boychuk)."

"2021-09-03","Full text: New N.S. premier, cabinet sworn into office HALIFAX - Tim Houston was sworn in as Nova Scotia's 30th premier Tuesday, naming 18 cabinet ministers, including seven women, after promising to address gender parity in the executive council. Houston and his new Progressive Conservative cabinet took the oath of office administered by Lt.-Gov. Arthur LeBlanc during a ceremony at the Halifax Convention Centre. The Tories surged to power in the Aug. 17 provincial election, capturing 31 of the legislature's 55 seats. The new premier told reporters he was proud of a cabinet he said included the largest number of women in the province's history. ""We went through an extensive process to speak to caucus and to make sure we have the right people in the right assignments that gives them a chance to be successful,"" he said. The Tory campaign focused almost exclusively on fixing health care and Houston said it would be his government's main priority. To that end, he named political newcomer Michelle Thompson to the health portfolio along with caucus veterans Barbara Adams, who will head the new Department of Seniors and Long Term Care, and Brian Comer, who will look after the Office of Mental Health and Addictions in addition to his duties as minister for Communications Nova Scotia. Thompson, a registered nurse and former nursing home CEO, defeated incumbent Liberal minister Randy Delorey in the Antigonish riding. She was described by Houston as an ""intelligent, compassionate and focused person"" who understands health care. She said her priority will be to improve access to primary care for Nova Scotians who are without a family doctor. ""It's exciting and a little daunting — I won't lie,"" Thompson said. ""I've been in health care for 30 years and I feel that my lived experience is an asset in this role."" A total of six rookie politicians made it into cabinet, including Jill Balser as minister of the new Department of Labour Skills and Immigration, Susan Corkum-Greek as minister of economic development and Becky Druhan as minister of education. Other first-time politicians who are now ministers include former radio news director Greg Morrow in the agriculture portfolio and Brian Wong, who will lead the Department of Advanced Education. Both Corkum-Greek and Morrow also beat sitting cabinet ministers in the recent election. Former interim Tory leader Karla MacFarlane is the new minister of community services and will also be responsible for the Office of the Status of Women and the Office of L'nu Affairs, while veteran Cape Breton member Allan MacMaster is the new deputy premier. MacMaster also gets the all-important finance portfolio, while Brad Johns becomes justice minister and Tim Halman is the new minister of environment and climate change. Two other caucus veterans were also given cabinet responsibilities, including Pat Dunn as minister of communities, culture, tourism and heritage and as the minister responsible for African Nova Scotian affairs. Houston's former leadership rival John Lohr is minister of the Department of Municipal Affairs and Housing. Lohr takes the portfolio at a time when pressure is mounting to do something to address the lack of affordable housing and skyrocketing rents, especially in the greater Halifax area. Lohr said he realizes the gravity of the situation. ""In fact, Premier Houston has indicated to me that this is his second-most important file right now,"" he said. ""We recognize that there are huge issues in housing."" Houston has said that rent control is not the answer, and Lohr said his priority will be to work with the private sector to find solutions. Other cabinet members include Tory Rushton as minister of natural resources, Colton LeBlanc as minister of Service Nova Scotia and Acadian affairs and Kim Masland as minister of public works. Meanwhile, Houston told reporters his government intends to return to the legislature for the fall sitting in mid-October. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 31, 2021.

"2021-09-03","Full text: (ANNews) – Assembly of First Nations Alberta Regional Chief Marlene Poitras has issued a statement in response to the Alberta government’s refusal to observe Sept. 30 as the National Day of Reconciliation, tying it into their recent decision not to set up voting booths on reserve for October’s referenda and senate elections as examples of an anti-Indigenous bent in the United Conservative Party. “There have been too many stories in recent days of this provincial government ignoring First Nations peoples and communities in the province as of late, enough is enough,” wrote Poitras. “Why won’t the government step up and acknowledge this day, which directly responds to the TRC calls to action to bring more awareness to the struggles Canada’s First Peoples have gone through in dealing with colonization?” While $10 million is being offered to municipalities to support voting in plebiscites and the senate elections on Oct. 18, no support is being offered to reserves to make it easier for First Nation members to vote, she added. “Instead, we are told ‘drive to the nearest community’. For some nations in Alberta this is an over 100km trek in one direction, for others, they are fly in communities and are left without any options to participate in the democratic process,” says Poitras. “This government’s actions are showing that First Nations aren’t just an afterthought, they are outright unimportant.” As of writing there are two referenda occurring on municipal election day — one on whether the province should oppose the federal equalization program that transfers a portion of federal income taxes to lower-income provinces, which Premier Jason Kenney says is unfair to Alberta, and another on adopting Daylight Savings Time year-round. Since reserves are technically not municipalities, their elections occur on different timelines and thus are not included in October’s civic election. However, as Piikani Nation member Adam North Peigan previously told Alberta Native News, the provincial government is in effect disenfranchising First Nations by making it more difficult for them to vote than people in municipalities. “These issues should have input from all Albertans, whether you’re pink, blue or black,” Peigan said.

"2021-09-02","Full text: As Canada approaches the halfway point in the federal election, the Fairy Creek protests over old-growth logging on Vancouver Island are quickly becoming the face of a much broader conflict between environmental goals and economic forces. The protests at Fairy Creek are on track to become the largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history, surpassing the Clayoquot protests, sometimes called the War in the Woods. Clayoquot saw more than 900 arrested. The latest count at Fairy Creek is 824. Almost 30 years later, the similarities are striking. In both cases, RCMP has enforced injunctions to clear protesters, and in both cases, the protests are taking place under a provincial NDP government that campaigned on protecting old-growth and failed to live up to its promises. Experts say the root causes of conflict over old-growth logging have never been adequately addressed, leading to a climate where First Nations, businesses, environmentalists, courts, and communities have been pitted against each other. British Columbia’s largest privately owned timber company, the Teal-Jones Group, owns the tree licence at Fairy Creek. The Rainforest Flying Squad (RSF) is leading the blockades that are slowing access to the site. The Ditidaht, Huu-ay-aht, and Pacheedaht First Nations have declared their right to be stewards of their land and have asked the protesters to leave. The province has jurisdiction under Canadian law to manage resource development, but the old-growth is also home to a number of at-risk species, giving the federal government jurisdiction, too. Then there is the B.C. Supreme Court, which has issued an injunction to clear protesters, and the RCMP, which has been ordered to enforce the injunction. So what is happening on the ground? Why does it matter? And how did it get to this point? For over a year, the RFS has been building blockades and digging trenches to prevent access to the old-growth logging sites. “We've had over a dozen camps in various locations basically playing a cat and mouse game with industry over the past year,” says Joshua Wright, a RSF co-founder. Since May, the RCMP has been enforcing an injunction granted to Teal-Jones to clear protesters. The police dismantle blockades and protesters’ camps, pushing the front line up the mountain as activists regroup and build again. “It’s been one camp raided after another ... and now we're down to Fairy Creek HQ,” Wright said. Last week, he told Canada’s National Observer this was looking like the last stand, saying activists were “in the end game of the blockades potentially.” But over the weekend, activists locked themselves in a trench using an increasingly common technique called a “sleeping dragon” that essentially involves attaching a pipe to something (in this case, the bottom of a trench, though others have reportedly used the technique atop a tripod), sticking one’s hand in the pipe, and then locking themselves to it. The pipe prevents police from simply cutting through the lock. One activist stayed in for “85 hours straight,” according to Wright. “The trench is extremely unsafe and unstable and police are trying to determine the best way to stabilize the trench and then conduct rescue operations,” RCMP said in a statement late Friday. The delay proved to be an effective tactic. Wright says over the weekend, protesters scored a “major victory” when approximately 100 people marched on the front line and the RCMP “retreated.” “We reclaimed the bridge, reclaimed River Camp, going all the way down to this area called Red Dress. So, the RCMP (has) been pushed back majorly, and then today, enforcement is going to begin again,” Wright told Canada’s National Observer on Monday. Recently, video of police pepper-spraying and dragging protesters was widely shared on social media, bringing the old-growth issue to national attention. Federal NDP public safety critic Jack Harris has called for an independent investigation into RCMP use of force at Fairy Creek. The RCMP says it is enforcing the B.C. Supreme Court’s interim injunction order in the Fairy Creek watershed, but nowhere does it say how police should execute the order. “The RCMP has discretion about how much enforcement they actually do here,” said Andrew Gage, a staff lawyer with West Coast Environmental Law. “Someone's making a decision about how much money to spend on this, and that's not directed by the courts.” The RCMP did not return a request for comment. B.C.’s Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth was not made available for an interview. One of the trenches dug to slow access to the site. Photo via Fairy Creek Blockade / Facebook Old-growth forests are ancient ecosystems that protect biodiversity. They’re home to endangered animals, are natural carbon sinks, and once logged, are gone forever. There are trees in the Fairy Creek watershed estimated to be over 1,000 years old. The federal Liberals have pledged, if re-elected, to set up a $50-million fund to help protect old-growth as a way to help slow the decline in biodiversity. During B.C.’s pandemic election last fall, the incumbent provincial NDP also promised to enact all recommendations from an old-growth strategic review it initiated. The recommendations represent a fundamental shift in how forests are managed, with a recognition it should be for ecosystem health rather than timber, with ecological constraints imposed. Recently the province launched an old-growth advisory panel, staffed with well-respected forest experts and environmentalists, but only a few weeks previously, Premier John Horgan unveiled a forestry plan activists compared to gasoline on a fire. The ongoing protests are also pulling into sharp focus the challenges with overlapping jurisdictions. “The province has the most obvious jurisdiction under Canadian law,” says Gage. But “the federal government has jurisdiction where the province is going to do something that is going to undermine a federal authority.” It’s “more of a backstop jurisdiction,” he said, adding federal funding is often a way for Ottawa to get control over things when it doesn’t have clear jurisdiction. The province calls the shots on natural resource development, but the federal government has jurisdiction over species at risk. The Ditidaht, Huu-ay-aht, and Pacheedaht First Nations also claim jurisdiction to manage forests in their traditional, unceded territory. Days after the nations declared sovereignty over managing the land, the B.C. government announced two-year deferrals of logging in nearly 200,000 hectares in the Fairy Creek watershed. However, some critics remain concerned this is kicking the can down the road because it is not a deferral of all old-growth logging. “The province approved (the deferrals) in an effort to try to reduce tension in the area, but the Paachedaht elder who has been at the forefront of the forest defence there, elder Bill Jones, asked for folks to stay because a lot of the surrounding old-growth forests were not included in that deferral,” said Tegan Hansen, a forest campaigner with climate group Stand.earth. As Canada’s National Observer has previously reported, divisions between First Nations, environmentalists, and within communities themselves, have been laid bare through these protests. Revenue-sharing agreements, like the one the Pacheedaht First Nation has with the province, give the right to receive revenue from logging. Environmentalists trying to stop the logging, therefore, pose a threat to that income, which is driving part of the tension. Huu-ay-aht Chief Coun. Robert J. Dennis Sr. says Fairy Creek activists need to be more respectful of First Nations. ""The protesters have called for a halt of all old-growth harvesting, so when they say that, they put our treaty rights into that category,"" he said. ""They're infringing on our right to exercise our cultural ability to harvest old-growth cedar for cultural purposes."" Teal-Jones says it's committed to reconciliation. “Teal-Jones is abiding by the First Nations’ declaration, and has suspended all harvesting, road-building, and related activities in the deferred areas, including Fairy Creek,” the company said in a statement. “The First Nations’ declaration clearly states forestry work in other areas of their traditional territories will continue and the First Nations have asked all parties to allow that forestry work to continue without interference.” The Pacheedaht and Ditidaht Nations, and elder Jones, did not return a request for comment. Old-growth forests may be a rich ecosystem, but forestry represents the largest manufacturing sector of B.C.’s economy, worth billions of dollars annually. The province receives hundreds of millions in revenue annually from the forest sector as well. “Most of B.C.'s forest is publicly owned and the government parcels the right to log those trees out to private corporations. Historically, that was in return for a promise of having mills operate and create jobs,” explains Gage. The government sets an annual allowable cut that functions as both a maximum and minimum amount by requiring companies to log within 10 per cent of the allowable cut. In other words, Teal-Jones is obligated to log a certain amount from the area or risk losing the licence. That legislation is still in place at a time when the province has committed to protecting old-growth and reveals the tension between climate and jobs is still evident in the provincial government, Gage says. “This came to a head in the 1990s, and I think both then and now it's because the expectations of the NDP were higher than they had been,” said Gage. “In both cases, when in opposition, they were very critical of the logging of old-growth, and people who supported them really expected them to take action and were really disappointed.” Gage said “the underlying causes of the protests have never been addressed well.” “With Clayoquot, the NDP got elected on a mandate to end the War in the Woods … and they tried to cut the baby down the middle,” said Gage. “They’d protect the lower Walbran, but not the upper Walbran, they’d protect large tracts of Clayoquot Sound, but not all of it.” Hansen sees a similar story of not following through playing out today. “What's happening right now in B.C., and specifically on Pacheedaht and Ditidaht territories on southern Vancouver Island, is really a result of years of inaction to protect old-growth forests … and more recently, inaction from the BC NDP government to follow through on an election promise they made last year,” she said, referring to a commitment to stop logging in old-growth forests at high risk of biodiversity loss. Hansen said she believes it’s time to start labelling old-growth as a “conflict resource.” “We talk about conflict diamonds in our pop culture, but old-growth timber that's being extracted in many places in British Columbia (is) essentially conflict resources,” she said.

"2021-09-02","Full text: Trudeau faces economic broadsides as GDP contracts OTTAWA - Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau faced broadsides for his government's efforts to make housing affordable and his handling of the economy that contracted just ahead of the election call. Affordability has already emerged as a key election talking point among the major parties, and it landed back on the campaign trail alongside the economy on Tuesday. Statistics Canada reported the economy contracted at an annualized rate of 1.1 per cent between April and June, and estimated another drop in real gross domestic product in July. Speaking in the Ottawa suburb of Kanata, Trudeau said there are pockets of the economy that remain weak, pointing to arts and culture as an example, even as he argued the economy overall was roaring back. It's why, he said, emergency supports have dropped in value, even though the Liberal government extended their lifespan through the fall because of weaker-than-expected economic indicators. He also argued that Conservative plans for child care, among other proposals, would hurt the pace of the economic recovery if women aren't able to enter the workforce in greater numbers. Trudeau didn't directly say if he foresaw a time, if re-elected, that he may have to adjust federal spending to prevent spiralling deficits. After eking out a gain in June to end the second quarter of the year, the economy appears to have contracted in July and left overall economic activity about two per cent below the levels seen prior to the pandemic in February 2020. Speaking in Ottawa, O'Toole said the figures show the country is ""heading further down the road of recession, not the road of recovery"" under the Liberals, vowing to wrangle deficits over a decade to balance the books. Pressed for details on where he would cut spending, O'Toole said he wouldn't cut at all and suggested something the Conservatives have long hammered Trudeau over — that the budget would balance itself. ""We will grow the economy so that we can get back to balance in a responsible and equitable way without cuts. That is our plan,"" he said. Experts say when the economy is good, or perceived to be going in the right direction, voters are inclined to reward the incumbent government. If voters feel the opposite, they are inclined to punish the incumbent. Perceptions of the economy often come down to what individuals see in their day-to-day lives, such as whether businesses in their community are opening or closing, and how their peers are faring financially. In Coquitlam, B.C., NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh looked to capitalize on that by outlining his plan to increase the capital gains tax on house flippers as a plank in making housing costs more affordable. Statistics Canada noted Tuesday that Canadian households took on $84.2 billion more in mortgage debt over the first half of 2021, adding to the $62.3 billion in the last half of 2020 as the housing prices soared amid low supply, high demand, and rock-bottom interest rates. A cooling housing market was part of the reason why the economy didn't fare as well as expected over the last few months, but Singh argued his plan wouldn't further affect long-term growth. ""It's about the type of economic growth that we want,"" he said. ""We don't want economic growth to be driven by rich investors that want to make profit off of housing, or foreign investors that see an opportunity to invest in our Canadian housing market, driving up the cost of housing for Canadians who can't afford a home."" Also causing problems with the economy were supply-chain issues that don't yet look to have abated. Green Leader Annamie Paul proposed to cut down on food imports by one-third and replace them with more domestic production, which she said would help rural economies and improve food security. ""An overreliance on global supply chains will necessarily mean that there is a compromise, there is a threat to our sovereignty and our national security,"" she said in Toronto. The dual attacks on Trudeau from Singh and O'Toole landed as a new poll suggests Conservatives and New Democrats have momentum heading into the second half of the federal election campaign, while the Liberals are bleeding support. Thirty-four per cent of decided voters who took part in the Leger survey said they support O'Toole's Conservatives — ahead of the Liberals and up four percentage points since Aug. 16, when the campaign got underway. Support for Singh's New Democrats is also up four points, to 24 per cent, support for Trudeau's Liberals is down five points to 30 per cent, and Green party support is down three points to two per cent. In Quebec, support for the Bloc Québécois stands at 29 per cent, behind the Liberals at 33 per cent. The online poll of 2,005 Canadians, conducted Aug. 27 to 30 in collaboration with The Canadian Press, cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 31, 2021. Subject: Polls & surveys; Housing; Gross Domestic Product--GDP; Economic growth; Economic indicators"

"2021-11-18","Full text: The Liberal Party’s climate plan includes commitments for a just transition and new funding to support fossil fuel-reliant provinces, but one oilpatch worker-led organization says the plan falls short of what is needed. In their climate plan, released on Sunday, the Liberals pledged $2 billion for a “Futures Fund” for Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador to “support local and regional economic diversification” and develop clean energy opportunities in the coming decade. The Liberal commitments for a just transition also highlight the $1.7-billion investment in skills development and retraining proposed in the 2021 budget earlier this year. “It's a good start, and it’s a good commitment,” said Luisa Da Silva, executive director of Iron and Earth. “Maybe that's what they need to do in order to start getting the ball rolling on this, but ultimately, it's going to cost more to transition Canada to net-zero.” In its Prosperous Transition Plan, Iron and Earth calls for a National Upskilling Initiative, which would require a federal investment of $10 billion over 10 years to upskill over one million workers at $10,000 per worker on average. If the $2 billion in new funding is used effectively to help Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador diversify and move toward net-zero, Da Silva says it will be a step in the right direction, particularly because those provinces are so dependent on the fossil fuel economy. But Caroline Brouillette, domestic policy manager for Climate Action Network Canada, cautions that although the $2-billion “Futures Fund” sounds promising, “whether this fund meaningfully advances a just transition will really depend on how it is governed, whether it engages with affected groups, and what strings are attached to the funding.” The previously announced $1.7 billion from the 2021 budget includes commitments like providing $250 million to help upskill and redeploy workers to new jobs, $55 million for a Community Workforce Development Program targeting decarbonization and just transition, and $960 million for a new Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program to help employers train and recruit workers in sectors like health, construction, and cleantech. In July, Natural Resources Canada launched a consultation process asking Canadians for feedback on how to achieve a just transition and promised to create just transition legislation informed by the input from unions, workers, Indigenous communities, provinces, territories, and organizations. However, Iron and Earth received an email from the Just Transition Team on Aug. 16 saying that due to the election call, “consultation sessions on proposed just transition legislation are postponed until further notice,” and any invitations sent for upcoming sessions are cancelled. Da Silva said she was disappointed by the news, saying, “it's the right sentiment, it's just the timing feels wrong” given that just transition was promised in 2019 and is only now coming to fruition on the eve of an election. Canadians can still participate by emailing their feedback to Natural Resources Canada until Sept. 30. The new Liberal plan also pledges to create “more opportunities for women, LGBTQ2 and other underrepresented people in the energy sector” and launch a Clean Jobs Training Centre to help “industrial, skill and trade workers across sectors to upgrade or gain new skills to be on the leading edge of (the) zero-carbon industry.” The NDP election platform promises Canadian workers will be “front and centre” in its climate action plan and intends to support them with expanding EI benefits, providing retraining and job placement services, ensuring companies retain workers during the transition, and giving older workers retirement security. The party also plans to create over a million new jobs through investments in clean energy, climate resilience, and social infrastructure, including a target to retrofit all buildings in Canada by 2050 to create jobs where people live and work. The Conservative election platform questions why Justin Trudeau would “phase out industries that employ millions of Canadians” and does not mention the phrase “just transition.” Instead, it promises to “support the energy sector as a critical part of our economy.” To support workers, the Conservative platform says it would create the Working Canadian Training Loan to provide low-interest loans of up to $10,000 to people who want to upgrade their skills, and would also invest $250 million over two years in projects through employers, unions, and organizations that help workers get the training they need. So far, no party has adopted Iron and Earth’s $10-billion National Upskilling Initiative, but Da Silva said whether you look at the climate crisis through the lens of economy, jobs, or climate, it all comes down to the same thing. “Whoever ends up being in Ottawa needs to realize that they have to take the transition to net-zero seriously to protect Canadians, so we have a decent future to look forward to,” said Da Silva. “The writing's on the wall. The economy that we have had and the ways that our energy has been sourced can't really continue into the future because it's just having too many ramifications.” Subject: Workers; Canadians; Energy industry; Training; Clean technology; Funding; Job creation; Skills"

"2021-09-02","Full text: It’s time to meet your candidates for the next federal election Sept. 20. Well, at least meet them in a virtual sense. Social distancing has infiltrated the latest version of a Canadian federal election and there have yet to be any in-person forums or gatherings during this fourth wave campaign. But there are a few online offerings in which people in the Kootenay-Columbia riding — which includes Nelson, Creston, Salmo, Kaslo and most of the RDCK — can get a sense of what mettle the candidates are made of. The candidates currently include a roster of five: • Rob Morrison - Conservative Party (https://voterobmorrison.ca/about/); • Wayne Stetski - New Democratic Party (https://www.facebook.com/Stetski/); • Robin Goldsbury – Liberal Party (https://www.robingoldsbury.ca/); • Rana Nelson – Green Party (https://www.greenparty.ca/en/riding/2013-59015); and • Sarah Bennett, People’s Party of Canada (https://kootenayppc.ca/kootenay-columbia-ppc-candidate-sarah-bennett/) On Sept. 8 (6 p.m.) Fridays for Future Nelson area and GreenPAC will be hosting an Elections Forum and the climate emergency online for the Kootenay-Columbia. Questions will be coming in advance from organizations across the riding. • You can set a reminder for when the forums go live at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJlMz5B5FjzV9-M8zBiCFMw As well, the same folks will be staging South Okanagan-West Kootenay (Sept. 7, 6 p.m.) forum on the same theme for those in Castlegar and parts of the RDCK. Through the efforts of some East Kootenay chamber of commerce’s the Kootenay-Columbia candidates gather again online, but in a closed format. On Sept. 9 local media in Cranbrook and Kimberley will grill the candidates and the result will be recorded and posted online on chamber websites and social media sites. Questions for the candidates are to be emailed to forum@jcikootenay.com by Aug. 31 at 11:59 p.m. The only other offering for the Kootenay-Columbia candidates so far will be another virtual event on Sept. 10 (5 p.m.) where people can hear from the five candidates. The forum — hosted by Black Press media — will be online live at https://www.facebook.com/events/270603887916968/. Currently, the traditional host of a federal election forum — the Nelson and District Chamber of Commerce — has not announced any event prior to the election. In the last federal election in 2019, Nelson at its Best hosted an all-candidates forum, but has not confirmed an online version this time around. This story will be updated if, and when, any other election-related forums are announced. Kootenay-Columbia riding The area known as the Kootenay-Columbia constituency was created in 1996, pieced together with parts of the Kootenay East and Kootenay West-Revelstoke ridings. Seven years later it welcomed the addition of a small part of the Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan riding, with a further adjustment coming in 2012 during the federal electoral boundaries redistribution. That move inserted Nelson, Salmo and Kaslo into the Kootenay-Columbia mix — moving over from the Southern Interior — while Nakusp joined the newly formed South Okanagan-West Kootenay and the Needles area were handed over to the North Okanagan-Shuswap. Those boundaries were used when the writ was dropped in the 2015 federal election. The riding contains: • the Regional District of East Kootenay; • Kaslo, Salmo, Creston and Nelson; • RDCK areas of A, B, C, D, E, F and G; • Creston Indian Reserve No. 1; and • Revelstoke, Golden, subdivisions A and B, Tobacco Plains Indian Reserve No. 2.

"2021-09-02","Full text: Elections Canada is urging community leaders and associations to get new Canadians to vote this coming election. “This is an important message to get out because the voter turnout among new Canadians has been historically low,” said Andrea Marantz, Regional Media Advisor for Elections Canada in B.C. “We are reaching out to community leaders across the country through our Inspire Democracy platform, and a handbook for community leaders, and are urging them to get the message out,” she told New Canadian Media. Compared with established immigrants (those who have lived in the country for 10 years or more) and non-immigrants, new Canadians (those who’ve immigrated to Canada in the previous 10 years) were less likely to vote in the 2011 general election. This was also the case in 2015, although the gap between the two groups narrowed, according to Elections Canada. Many reasons have been put forward to explain this, including the lack of democratic traditions in some regions of the world, the lack of trust in institutions, or differences in political culture. Immigrants from Eastern Europe and East Asia had the lowest voter turnout rates. The data also show differences in civic engagement. New Canadians are less likely than non-immigrants and established immigrants to be members of a group, organization or association, such as sports and recreational organizations, or union or professional associations. In 2015, youth (aged 18–34) who were born in Canada were more likely to say that they had voted in all or most elections for which they were eligible (64 per cent), compared to youth who were not born in Canada (48 per cent), according to the National Youth Survey (NYS). Among those heeding the call from Elections Canada is Ally Wang, a Chinese-Canadian living in Richmond, B.C., who recently launched the website CCGTV.org or (Chinese-Canadians Go To Vote). “When Chinese people gather, they talk about their kids’ school, shopping and other things, but not politics…This is the culture, and we need to change that and get them to participate more in politics…Then, there are language barriers where the candidate’s message doesn’t get across to the Chinese-Canadian voter,” she said. The Richmond Centre riding, which has the highest percentage of Chinese-Canadian citizens in B.C., had the lowest voter turnout in the province in the 2015 election. Wang and her colleagues, who established the website, are currently canvassing candidates across the country for their views on Chinese-Canadian issues with five questions, including how they will respond to discrimination against the community, China-Canada relations, and what they will do if the English media vilifies the community. “We hope the answers which will be posted on the website will create discussion, because they are specific issues raised by the community,” said Wang. Wang’s group is also sending the message to her community not to vote for candidates simply because they are Asian or Chinese or come from the same cultural background. “There is a tendency in ethnic communities to do that because the candidate speaks the same language or mother tongue or shares the same heritage,” she said. In neighbouring Surrey, where 43 per cent of the population is comprised of immigrants and where the top three languages spoken at home are Punjabi, Chinese and Tagalog, veteran radio host, Gurpreet Singh, said he constantly urges the community to get out and vote on his shows. “I keep reminding my listeners on how hard the community fought for the right to vote and why we need everyone to vote to maintain our vibrant democracy,” said Singh. He said the farmers crisis in India and the plight of Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan are among the international issues raised by the community. “People want to know the candidates’ views on the issues affecting their homelands as well as other core issues like housing affordability and climate change…Candidates that can speak to both resonate with Surrey voters, especially those from the South Asian community,” he said. The Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC) has also launched a get out and vote campaign, entitled “We’re done asking, we’re voting.” The campaign seeks to engage Indigenous women from coast-to-coast-to-coast to get out to the polls and make their voices heard. “Indigenous women have waited long enough for the Government of Canada to make our issues a priority,” said NWAC CEO, Lynne Groulx. “This election, we’re done asking, we’re voting. When political parties see us show up at the polls, they are going to have to start listening and taking action.” The Canadian Alliance of Chinese Associations (CACA), with a membership of over 130 Chinese associations, is also actively working on getting the message to its members on the importance of turning up at the ballot box. At a recent press conference, Renming Wei, acting chairman of the group, said many Chinese-speaking immigrants either do not vote or vote for people of Chinese descent. “We have the lowest voting turnout among all ethnic groups and our voices never get heard by decision-makers,” he said. “If we want to be heard, we need to get out and vote.” Subject: Noncitizens; Canadians; Community; Chinese Canadians; Voter behavior; Elections"

"2021-09-02","Full text: Veteran Quebec Liberal Thériault won't run in 2022 MONTREAL - Longtime Quebec Liberal Lise Thériault says she won't be seeking re-election in 2022.

"2021-09-02","Full text: Gender parity expected in new N.S. Tory cabinet HALIFAX - Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Houston will be sworn into office during a ceremony Tuesday in Halifax, and the new premier has suggested his cabinet will have gender parity. ""It will be a capable cabinet and it will be representative for sure,"" Houston told reporters last week about his cabinet, which is expected to be between 15 and 18 members. Houston's Tories surged to power in the Aug. 17 provincial election, capturing 31 of the legislature's 55 seats. The new caucus is composed of 16 returning members and 15 new members. Of that, Houston will be able to choose from among three veteran women members and six new women members in order to meet his parity goal. The previous Liberal government under Iain Rankin had four women in the 17-member cabinet, including deputy premier Kelly Regan. Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, said former Tory interim leader Karla MacFarlane is one of the veterans who will likely be picked. MacFarlane has been touted as a potential deputy premier. ""She will definitely get a senior cabinet post, but whether it's deputy premier is another question because she's from the same region as Tim Houston,"" said Urbaniak, noting that the position is often used to balance geographical interests. Returning member Barbara Adams is another almost certain choice, he said. She distinguished herself in Opposition as an advocate for seniors. Adams would also help give Houston cabinet representation from the Halifax area. Of the newcomers, Urbaniak mentioned Digby-Annapolis MLA Jill Balser, Hants West MLA Melissa Sheehy-Richard and Antigonish MLA Michelle Thompson as possible choices. Sheehy-Richard has experience in community development and Thompson was a nursing home CEO. Lunenburg West MLA Becky Druhan might also be in the mix after making an impression during the election campaign, Urbaniak said. In addition to gender, Houston must juggle a number of other factors such as experience and professional talent, diversity, geography, and loyalty to the party and to the leader. Another factor at play is Houston's campaign pledge to invest heavily in the province's ailing health system. Houston has already highlighted health care and managing the COVID-19 pandemic as his immediate priorities once in office. ""Fortunately, he does have health-care professionals in the caucus so he will have some good bench strength there,"" Urbaniak said, referring to Adams, a former physiotherapist, and Colton LeBlanc, a former paramedic. Experienced hands such as Allan MacMaster, Tim Halman and former leadership rival John Lohr will also likely make it into cabinet, although Urbaniak pointed out that experience won't necessarily ""trump everything else."" ""Legislative experience counts but it's not everything, and we will definitely see newcomers in the cabinet, maybe even as many as half of the ministers being newcomers,"" he said.

"2021-09-02","Full text: As far as one local student leader is concerned, Ottawa’s decision not to host polling stations on post-secondary campuses during the federal election is “a disservice to Canada’s democratic process.” Alexandra Koslock, chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Students’ chapter in Manitoba, said she was disheartened to learn this week that Elections Canada will not run ballot boxes at colleges or universities. It was during fall 2019 that Koslock, a recent graduate of the University of Winnipeg, cast her first federal vote. She did so at a poll on campus, after running into peers who were promoting the option and encouraging turnout. “It’s very sad for students. We know that having polling stations on campus increases accessibility for voter turnout,” she said Friday. “We see this as a disservice to Canada’s democratic process, especially in a year where millennials make up the largest voting block across the country.” The University of Manitoba, U of W and Red River College all ran polls during the 43rd general election. The stations, which are part of the Vote on Campus program, the product of a successful 2015 pilot to increase youth participation, attracted 977, 819 and 465 voters, respectively, in 2019. On Wednesday, Elections Canada posted on Twitter the program is being suspended “due to the challenges brought on by the pandemic and the minority government situation.” In response to follow-up queries, the agency said it could not give school administrators firm dates to help them plan because of the snap election. (A U of M spokesperson said the school was notified about Elections Canada’s stance last October.) Political scientist Félix Mathieu called the snap election excuse “shady,” given a fall general election was widely predicted. “The decision of not having polling stations on campuses, the impact of this, is huge. It really concerns me,” said the assistant professor of politics at U of W. Mathieu is worried that cancelling polls designed to make voting convenient for students will affect turnout — but also, about how the absence of a regular campaign on campuses could shape future habits and turnout, given students construct their worldview and political identity at university. He added the New Democrats, who rely on the youth vote more than other parties, will likely lose votes because the polls are closed. In 2019, 54 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 cast ballots; by comparison, 79 per cent of the 65- to 74-year-old population voted. The biggest barrier to improving turnout next month is that COVID-19 has heightened apathy, said Brendan Scott, president of Manitoba’s largest students union. The 2021 U of M students union election, during which Scott was elected, had historically low turnout. Scott is not that concerned about the loss of campus polls, noting an estimated 70 per cent of U of M students will be studying at home this fall. “Students are very much less engaged in general because there haven’t been any in-person events or any real events within the past year and a half,” he said, adding the union will encourage students to vote via social media. The Canadian Federation of Students has launched its Generation Vote campaign to outline party policies and promote ballot logistics. Koslock said students are waiting to be shown that they are, in fact, a priority, adding she hopes Elections Canada will confirm details on how it will make voting accessible to youth in the coming days. Among the key issues for young voters are affordable post-secondary education, pandemic relief policies and climate change. Options for casting a ballot this year include voting early at an assigned polling station or by special ballot, either via mail or at an Elections Canada office, or on Sept. 20 at one’s designated polling station.

"2021-09-01","Full text: Parties pounce on problematic candidates OTTAWA - Liberals and Conservatives took aim at each other's candidates on Monday, questioning past statements and actions to build a character case about why they, and not their opponent, should be trusted to govern after election day. The Conservatives started the day by questioning tax arrears that Liberal candidate Steven Guilbeault disclosed in a parliamentary ethics filing, which the heritage minister later explained to reporters travelling on the campaign stem from his separation and are being resolved. Guilbeault, likewise, used a series of posts on Twitter to highlight just over a dozen Conservative candidates who deny climate change, calling leader Erin O'Toole's party a home of ""dinosaurs."" And not long after, a Conservative candidate in Nova Scotia withdrew from the federal election after an allegation of sexual assault, which he denied, surfaced on social media. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, speaking in Granby, Que., said Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole should be careful about slinging mud at Liberal candidates because of myriad issues with some Tory candidates. Trudeau referenced longtime Conservative MP Cheryl Gallant in his comments to reporters, who in pre-election correspondence to her constituents claimed the Liberals were in favour of a ""climate lockdown."" ""It's probably a very dangerous path to walk for Mr. O'Toole to start trying to attack other people's candidates when we see that his own candidates won't even confirm that they're getting vaccinated,"" Trudeau said after outlining a plan to help restore Canada's big lakes and river systems. ""His own candidates are out there peddling conspiracy theories on vaccinations and, as we saw recently with Cheryl Gallant, on the environment."" Gallant on Sunday was forced to scrub an online video that included a cropped picture of Trudeau appearing to have some sort of noose around his neck. O'Toole didn't directly explain if Gallant would face repercussions. Instead, he repeatedly said that Conservative candidates were running on the party's platform, which includes proposals to address climate change. ""All of our candidates are committed to the plan. It's exactly what the country needs,"" O'Toole said after announcing a plan to crack down on puppy mills. ""Everyone will be focused on that plan and a positive campaign."" The series of events and comments framed the start of the third week of the federal campaign and all landed hours before the deadline for candidates to file their nomination papers with Elections Canada to get their names on the ballot for the Sept. 20 vote. The Conservative candidate for Dartmouth-Cole Harbour, Troy Myers, stepped down from the race on Monday morning hours after a woman posted a series of tweets alleging Myers had put his hand up her skirt while the two were attending a conference in Nova Scotia in October 2019. Myers said on Facebook the allegation is unequivocally false and he intends to challenge what he called defamatory statements. Neither Myers nor the woman could be reached for comment. O'Toole said his party takes any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment very seriously and shows support for victims, which is why Myers is no longer a candidate. Asked if the same would happen to a Liberal candidate, Trudeau said every situation is different and needs to be addressed with a proper process. ""But absolutely, Canadians deserve to know the people standing up to represent them to serve them in the House of Commons are not people who have shown disrespect or misbehaviour or are facing serious allegations,"" he said. Trudeau was dogged over the weekend by obscenity-spewing protesters angry about his pandemic policies, particularly on vaccination mandates, and at times effectively calling for the Liberal leader to die. The protests have become an ignominious addition to the campaign trail that the party leaders have denounced. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said there is a fine line between attacking a political opponent personally and going after them for policies. He said New Democrats would continue to criticize Trudeau for policies that Singh said have helped the Liberals politically even if they have cost students or homeowners financially. ""I don't believe in attacking someone just because I don't like them or because they're bad. That's horrible and shouldn't happen,"" Singh said in Ottawa after promising to boost spending at the Canada Revenue Agency to help crack down on ""ultrarich"" tax dodgers. ""But I absolutely believe people should know the decisions that a prime minister makes directly impact your life. And if they make bad decisions, you should know about them, and you should know those outcomes."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 30, 2021.

"2021-09-01","Full text: Michael Behiel, Humboldt’s mayor, is advocating accountability for federal parties on mental health, addictions and suicide which he calls an “ongoing epidemic.” According to Statistics Canada, in 2018, roughly 5.3 million people in Canada mentioned they needed some help for their mental health in the previous year. Almost half of these Canadians either had their needs partially met with some help, at 1.2 million people, or had needs that were fully unmet, at 1.1 million people. Canadians who needed help for their mental health, but were without a regular health care provider were more likely to report unmet or partially met needs at 60.3 per cent, compared to those who did have a regular health care provider at 41.2 per cent. The most frequently reported reasons for having unmet or partially met needs were related to not knowing where to go, being too busy or not being able to afford to pay. Almost one-quarter of respondents, 22.6 per cent who had unmet or partially met needs reported that they preferred to manage their needs on their own. “It just shocked me that when they announced the federal election not one party came out with any stance or any comments regarding mental health, addictions and suicide,” Behiel said. “What we are pushing for right now, is hopefully to have an all candidates forum in Humboldt where we will put this to them, asking them what their stance is and what they will be planning to do to address this pandemic in terms of these issues.” According to Behiel, after discussions with the province a working group was formed consisting of other municipal mayors and a Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association delegation with the specific goal of addressing homelessness, addictions and mental health in their communities. The group has met once with their next meeting set for November in Regina. “The working group is to try to start getting some motions forward and some of these things addressed and dealt with so we can move forward and get these things under control.” Federally, each party has a specific platform to address mental health care, but each one's methods differ drastically. The New Democratic Party (NDP) platform promises to make sure every Canadian can access dental, hearing, mental, addictions, and seniors’ care. To accomplish this they’re campaigning for a national universal pharmacare program that covers every Canadian. The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada platform promises to boost funding to provinces for mental health care, provide incentives to employers to provide mental health coverage to employees, and create a nation-wide, three-digit suicide prevention hotline. The Green Party platform promises to expand public health care to include pharmacare; establish a Crown corporation to bulk purchase and dispense prescription drugs and provide coverage to the one in three Canadians forced to pay for prescription medication; include basic dental care in national coverage; and extend dental care to low income children. Specifically in terms of addictions, the Green Party platform promises to treat drug addiction as a public health issue, not a felony. The Liberal Party of Canada platform promises to invest $10 billion to eliminate waitlists in the healthcare industry, invest $3 billion to hire 7,500 family doctors, nurses, and nurse practitioners over four years; and to recruit more health professionals in rural and remote regions. “It’s a crisis we have to address everywhere, and we see it not just in Humboldt but you read it in the news every day from Saskatoon, Regina, North Battleford, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton – it goes right across the country everywhere,” Behiel said. “These are your elected officials, so if you have an opportunity to speak to any of them, ask them, ‘What is your goal to deal with this?’” The federal election is set for Sept. 20.

"2021-09-01","Full text: Justin Trudeau was in Streetsville Friday morning, announcing his party’s plans to fund vaccine passports if Canadians deliver a Liberal government on September 20. Visiting a business in Mississauga owned by Syrian-Canadians, Trudeau used the opportunity to promote his newly confirmed candidate. The Liberal campaign could have visited any small business in Canada for its vaccine passport announcement, but strategists picked Mississauga—Streetsville. The riding is where recently nominated Rechie Valdez faces what promises to be a heavily contested competition, with no incumbent in play. Former Liberal MP Gagan Sikand represented Mississauga—Streetsville between 2015 and 2021, winning his seat twice. In October 2020, he stopped voting or speaking in virtual parliamentary sessions and disappeared on an unexplained long-term medical leave. The MP refused to answer questions about his absence and did not proactively inform residents he was no longer offering them direct political representation on Parliament Hill. Sikand did not resign his seat to trigger a by-election either. Eventually, after the federal election was called, Sikand confirmed he would not be seeking reelection. Valdez was nominated as his replacement, facing the unenviable task of convincing local residents to trust the Liberal Party to represent them after failing to do so for the past year. Mississauga—Streetsville is being contested by Farina Hassan for the NDP, and Dr. Jasveen Rattan for the Conservatives. Sikand won reelection in 2019, beating Conservative candidate Ghada Melek by about 10,000 votes and 17 percentage points, in what was a clean sweep for the Liberals across the city. You wouldn’t have known any of that watching Trudeau’s announcement. The Liberal Leader, who was joined by Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie, praised the City’s recently announced vaccination policy and offered warm words of encouragement to his newest candidate. He mentioned his personal relationship with Crombie, but did not raise any issues that could demonstrate a knowledge or interest in Mississauga’s pressing needs. “Mayor Crombie appeared at today’s event with Mr. Trudeau because Mr. Trudeau was announcing that a Liberal government would provide funding to help provinces create a proof of vacation program,” a spokesperson for Crombie told The Pointer. “Mayor Crombie has been vocal about the need for the Government of Ontario to create such a system.” The spokesperson added Crombie would appear alongside other federal leaders if she was invited and they offered policies to help her city. The majority of Trudeau’s press conference revolved around the announcement of a promised vaccination passport system, so public and private entities can verify the inoculation status of all Canadians who have been vaccinated, in an effort to keep communities safe. The event took place inside, with journalists, campaign organizers and restaurant staffers crowded together and with no way to maintain physical distancing. During the media session that followed, Trudeau took questions from travelling national journalists, largely on the topics of vaccination and Afghanistan. He wrapped up his event without taking a single question from a local reporter. Several non-national journalists, including The Pointer, were in attendance at the event. Advertised as an “open media availability”, the Liberal campaign suggested national and local journalists would be able to question the leader. Local reporters were told to turn up no later than 8:15 a.m. for an event scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. that did not actually start until 9:30 a.m. A spokesperson for the Liberal campaign said questions were normally taken from local media and that the Mississauga event was the only availability of the day. Staffers on the campaign said time constraints meant they could not take questions from local media. Trudeau was not made available for an interview and no opportunities were scheduled for questions at the three remaining GTA appearances he made Friday. After the event concluded, the Liberal Leader was met with support and opposition. Supporters chanted his name, while a scattering of vocal protestors shouted “traitor”. Opponents of Trudeau focused their frustration on Afghanistan, COVID-19 lockdowns and his party’s stance on vaccines. The absence of local questions or specific announcements to help projects and other needs in Mississauga allowed Trudeau to focus the stop on his latest announcement while dramatically increasing the profile of Valdez in Mississauga—Streetsville. The local Liberal candidate opened the press conference, beamed live around Canada, as signs emblazoned with her name were held prominently in the background of photo shoots. While local media were invited to take photos of the candidate and the party leader, effectively providing free advertising, they were kept silent when it came time to ask questions and challenge Trudeau. At midday on Friday, the Liberal campaign promised to provide written responses to questions The Pointer had planned to ask at the press conference. Answers, a spokesperson said, would be provided “ASAP”. The campaign did not respond to the two questions, asking why voters should trust another Liberal candidate in Streetsville, after the last MP left constituents without any direct representation in Ottawa over the past year. Recent polling has shown a lead for the Liberal Party slipping. Individual polling at the riding-specific level is rare, meaning voters often have to guess how close their local race is using aggregators, national polling and by analyzing where national party leaders spend their time. Poll aggregator 338Canada, which underestimated the Liberal lead in Mississauga—Streetsville two years ago, suggests the Liberals are polling at 43.8 percent (+/- 7 percent) in the riding, the Conservatives have 36.4 percent support (+/- 6.6 percent) and the NDP are at 13.4 percent (+/- 4.3 percent). The Pointer is publishing information from 338Canada, but cannot verify the accuracy of its aggregated polling projections, which have been outside its stated error margin in the past. The website uses various federal opinion polls, applying the proportional swing of public opinion to individual ridings and tying in some local demographic information to predict where local races lie during the federal election. A Mainstreet Research poll published on August 23 for the GTA showed Liberal support in Peel at 40.7 percent, compared to 33.5 for the Conservative Party and 17.8 for the NDP. At the national level, 338Canada currently has the Conservatives slightly ahead with 32.8 percent of support, compared to 32.5 percent for the Liberals and 19.7 percent for the NDP. Trudeau’s dismissal of Mississauga in favour of a national conversation is in keeping with how the Party Leader has campaigned in Peel in the past. Friday was Trudeau’s first visit to the region during the 2021 election campaign, after he made multiple stops in Mississauga and Brampton two years ago. While Mayor Crombie was present, she did not speak, which was a surprise after her vocal stance on the recently revived Mississauga Matters local campaign. It was used during the past two provincial and federal elections, in 2018 and 2019, to highlight and advocate aggressively for specific funding badly needed in the city. Detailed affordable housing needs in one of Canada’s fastest growing regions, public transit and other transportation pressures, a massive, multi-billion-dollar infrastructure deficit and support for local businesses reeling from the pandemic, are all part of Mississauga’s election advocacy plan. But you would not have known it yesterday, as she and Trudeau remained completely silent on the specific needs of the city. Mississauga has been grossly underfunded by the federal government, on a per capita basis, through its national infrastructure program, receiving less than ten percent of what it should have been given based on population during Trudeau’s first term in office between 2015 and 2019, when he had a majority government. City officials, led by Crombie, have a growing list of projects and crucial funding needs, including public safety and public health issues that the federal government can provide help with, while specific plans are completely dependent on Ottawa, but many are still waiting for approvals. The election is the best opportunity to secure commitments for the city, but that didn’t happen yesterday. While Peel continues to welcome an outsized share of new immigrants who arrive in Canada under the progressive policies of the Liberals, the party has failed to support large immigrant communities such as Mississauga and Brampton, where a current affordable housing crisis illustrates how badly designed some of the Liberal platform has been. Funding to support newcomers in desperate need of housing and other services has been an afterthought, while Liberal candidates often enjoy an association with a party that likes to play up its strong ties to immigrant communities. None of these issues were raised Friday, as local media with the knowledge of these pressing backyard issues were shut out of the question and answer portion. During several events in 2019, Trudeau failed to mention specific Peel issues, did not take local media questions and, when he did engage with questions focusing on the specific needs of the region, skirted around the details. For residents in Mississauga—Streetsville, the whirlwind election campaign will continue to unfold. Topics, including Canada’s response to the crisis in Afghanistan or the use of vaccination passports, are relevant to a campaign but local voters want to know about what’s being promised to help them in their day-to-day lives, as they face pressures unique to the place where they live. Even when the party leader spends the morning in their backyard, the complicated local issues in Mississauga—Streetsville continue to be ignored, while photo opportunities are beamed across the country.

In 1463, King Louis XI died after ruling France for 22 years. He was known for his diplomatic skills -- he was nicknamed the ""Spider King"" for his web of machinations -- and considered one of France's most successful kings in terms of uniting the country. Because of his fears of assassination, he spent his last years in virtual self-imprisonment near Tours. In 1780, American revolutionary general Benedict Arnold made a secret pact with the British to surrender the American fort at West Point, N.Y.

"2021-09-01","Full text: Flags on federal government property should remain at half-mast to honour Indigenous children who died at residential schools, but much more needs to be done for reconciliation, say Nunavut’s candidates for the Sept. 20 federal election. The Canadian government has kept flags on federal buildings lowered since May, after the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation said it identified the remains of 215 children in unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School. Similar announcements soon followed from other First Nations about graves at other former residential school sites. The federal government hasn’t indicated when it will raise its flags. Conservative candidate Laura MacKenzie said many Inuit don’t understand the symbolism behind flags being placed at half-mast because it’s a western tradition and there aren’t federal buildings in some of Nunavut’s smaller communities. “People need to be aware: what is half-mast?” she said. “That’s a federal government type of thing that was brought up north.”"

And, as the daughter of scientists, Hjertaas has one large priority if she finds herself in the House of Commons after September 20 – climate change. Climate is a very important issue for me,” she said. “A lot of people seem to be recognizing that climate change is happening.” She thinks the extreme weather and forest fires in Canada this year may have given voters an extra reason to check Liberal on the ballot. Hjertaas is employed as a legal aid lawyer, which gives her a unique perspective, she said. “What I do every day is stand up for people. I have a lot of experience dealing with sensitive situations,” she added. Along with her regular work load, Hjertaas volunteers in multiple areas, ranging from child hood literacy projects to the library board, the YWCA board and advocating for the French Canadian Society of Prince Albert. She also gives time doing pro bono law. Caring about others is why she is interested in politics. “I believe that politics is ultimately about helping people,” she said. “People have a duty to give back as much as they can.” Representing marginalized people in court has taught her that people need an advocate, whether in the criminal justice system or in the halls of the Parliament that makes the laws. “People in those situations aren’t able to represent themselves,” Hjertaas said. That is when she steps in. She chose the Liberal Party because of similar values. “The Liberal Party is the right party because their focus is people and communities,” Hjertaas said. “That’s what I care about as well.” In addition to working and volunteering, Hjertaas is a new mom and a “very outdoorsy person.” She enjoys hunting, camping and being outdoors.

(The Canadian Press) --- (NS-FedElxn-Pollution) The federal Liberals are promising to do more to stop plastic pollution. In Nova Scotia, Liberal cabinet minister Bernadette Jordan announced yesterday that a re-elected Liberal government will end plastic pollution by 2030 -- though details were lacking. Jordan also says the Liberals would collect and recycle more plastic bottles and require all plastic packaging to be made of 50 per cent recycled material by 2030. Only nine per cent of the plastic thrown out in Canada gets recycled. (The Canadian Press) --- (NB-Vaccine-Passport) New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs says his government will decide within three weeks whether it will introduce COVID-19 vaccine passports. Other provinces are already moving ahead with plans to introduce proof-of-vaccination systems, but Higgs says the government is still studying the issue. New Brunswick has seen an increase in COVID-19 cases in the past month, including 16 new cases confirmed on Friday when the active case count stood at 160. The federal government has said vaccine passports for international travel will be available for fully vaccinated Canadians sometime in early fall -- and they say proof of vaccination will be required for commercial air, interprovincial train and cruise ship passengers by October. (CBC New Brunswick) --- (Emerald-Ash-Borer) The Nature Conservancy of Canada is asking residents of Atlantic Canada to help prevent the spread of an invasive pest. The non-profit group says people should stop transporting firewood to limit the spread of the emerald ash borer, a tiny beetle that is destroying ash trees in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and 35 U-S states. The group says the tiny, metallic-green bug has become the most destructive invasive forest insect in North America, killing tens of millions of ash trees. Biologist Dan Kraus says the beetle can't fly very far, but it has made a habit of hiding in firewood logs and branches, where it can hitch a ride to other locations. (The Canadian Press) --- (NS-Body-Cameras) Body cameras are now being worn by police officers in Truro, Nova Scotia. The police force is the second in the province to adopt the new technology -- the Kentville police force was the first to do so in 2018. Truro Police Chief Dave MacNeil says the cameras are now fully operational. He says the cameras will help the police force become more accountable and open to the public. (CBC Nova Scotia) --- (PEI-Missing-Man) Police say the ground search has concluded for a missing 28-year-old man. Jamie Sark of Lennox Island was last seen on August 21st near Mosquito Path, a wooded area of the island along the province's north shore. He was reported missing on Wednesday. Prince District R-C-M-P say some of Sark's personal belongings were found near a water tower on the island, which is in western P-E-I.

"2021-08-31","Full text: (Indigenous-Education-BC) Calls for a provincewide investigation are ringing through a British Columbia school district after an independent report revealed Indigenous students are disproportionately held back and diverted from the typical graduation path. The report shows there is a palpable lack of trust between the Prince George Board of Education and many Indigenous stakeholders, as well as a ``substantial culture of fear'' around raising concerns. It also found the school bus schedules also prevent many Indigenous students from participating in after-school programs or attending French immersion or other specialized schools.

O'Toole says he raised the issue with Blaine Higgs because of a provincial policy not to fund the procedures performed outside of three approved hospitals. Before the election was called, the Liberal government announced it would withhold some of the federal health-transfer money earmarked for the province over its refusal to pay for abortions at a clinic in Fredericton, saying that made it difficult to access the service. Advocates have pushed the federal government to use its powers under the Canada Health Act to ensure provinces provide proper abortion services.(10) --- (United-States-Afghanistan)(Audio:077) President Joe Biden is vowing to expand a U.S. air campaign against the Islamic extremist group whose suicide bomb attack at the Kabul airport killed scores of Afghans and 13 American service members.

"2021-08-30","Full text: Unrest and the unexpected plague Paul's leadership OTTAWA - Green Party of Canada Leader Annamie Paul says she got into politics knowing it would bring a constant barrage of the unexpected into her life, and there is no denying that it has delivered. ""It definitely is as advertised, which is a one of a kind experience that you really can never fully prepare yourself for,"" said Paul. ""And, you know, you just have to ride the roller-coaster when you're in it."" But even Paul acknowledges she could never have predicted that roller-coaster would include fending off a non-confidence motion 10 months into her leadership and weeks before a federal election call. ""That's true,"" she says, laughing. ""That is true."" Paul is a bubbly, easygoing woman with a thousand-watt smile who is passionate about helping the most vulnerable and improving the systems they depend on. Things like long-term care, a system which last year claimed her father's life after a treatable bladder infection wasn't discovered until it had turned into a fatal case of sepsis. She spent much of the first months of her leadership hosting virtual town halls trying to find ways to fix the broken system. Born in Toronto to Caribbean immigrants, Paul's mother, a teacher, launched the political spirit in Paul, taking her to union rallies as a kid. She is a lawyer by training but bristles that she is often described as a ""Toronto lawyer"" when she has never practised law. After law school at the University of Ottawa, and a masters in public affairs from Princeton University, she returned to Toronto and founded the Canadian Centre for Political Leadership to help increase the political representation of racialized women. She has worked as an adviser at the International Criminal Court in Belgium and co-founded an organization to mentor sustainable development groups in Barcelona, Spain. She is married to international human rights lawyer Mark Freeman and they have two sons. Paul enjoyed the fact that it used to be hard to summarize her in a short snappy sentence, but is well aware that changed when she won the Green leadership, becoming the first Black and Jewish woman to helm a national party in Canada. ""I know also that it will change things for the better, that there are people who might not have considered this for themselves as an option, that might not have felt reflected and represented that do now,"" she said. But she added that diversity has to become so normal in politics ""that a person like me can run without feeling like they have to represent the entirety of their racial group or religious group or whatnot."" While racism is something Paul has come up against most of her life, the hatred has escalated since she became the party leader. She recently called for more effort to stop the targeted attacks, which for her included recent threats of physical violence in online forums. In June she also said racism and sexism were behind a plot from within the Green party to oust her as leader. ""First woman of colour, first Black person and first Jewish woman elected to lead a major federal party — it was never going to be a walk in the park,"" Paul wrote in mid-June, The unrest in the Green party was simmering for months, and exploded in June over Paul's position on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Paul said both sides needed to de-escalate and move toward constructive dialogue, a statement that was publicly challenged by two of the three Green MPs. The dispute got personal when an aide to Paul accused some Green MPs and members of anti-Semitism and vowed to campaign against them in the next election. In the midst of it all, Jenica Atwin, the first Green MP elected in Atlantic Canada, crossed the floor to the Liberals, and is running under their banner in this election. That loss angered former Green leader Elizabeth May, who had been a Paul supporter but has not publicly supported her in recent months. May declined to be interviewed for this article. Paul also snubbed both May and Paul Manly, the only other incumbent Green MP, when the election was called by not including either of them in her shadow cabinet. Manly could only muster up that she had said good things about long-term care when he was asked about Paul's leadership during a recent interview on an unrelated topic. A week after Atwin's departure, members of the party's governing council moved to bring a non-confidence vote in Paul's leadership and later tried to revoke her party membership. Paul appealed to an arbitrator, who stopped the moves, prompting some senior party officials to launch a legal challenge. In mid-August, the party elected a new national council, with more Paul supporters on it, and since the election was called the animosity between party headquarters and Paul appears to have quieted. Money is still an issue — legal bills for the leadership battle are in the hundreds of thousands — and it's put a damper on how much Paul can campaign outside the Toronto Centre riding where she is running for the third time. Party infighting is as common to politics as selfies and self-aggrandizing, but the scale, timing and public nature of the Green's troubles were unusual. ""It's hard to think of part of going into a situation where, on the eve of election, you're actively trying to oust your leader, questioning her membership, withholding funding for the local campaign,"" said Earnscliffe Strategy Group principal Shakir Chambers. ""I can't think of a time like this."" Zahra Sultani, former adviser to Ontario's Tory environment minister and now a senior consultant at Loyalist Public Affairs, said it looks like the Greens are having ""an identity crisis."" Sultani said after more than 14 years with May at the helm, the Greens seem to not know where to go from here, even though May remained an MP and their leader in the House of Commons because Paul didn't have a seat. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 28, 2021. Subject: Long term health care; Political leadership"
"2021-08-30","Full text: The lack of good faith negotiations by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in its dealing with five First Nations on the West Coast could result in the criminalization of Nuu-chah-nulth fishers who exercise their court-affirmed right to a commercial fishery, asserts First Nations leadership. “The federal department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) continues to stonewall negotiations and acts as if it is above the law,” reads an Aug. 24 press release from the five nations impacted—Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Ehattesaht/Chinehkint, Mowachaht/Muchalaht and Tla-o-qui-aht. The nations have said they will fish according to their own fishing plans—pitting Nuu-chah-nulth fishers against DFO officers patrolling Nuu-chah-nulth waters—because DFO hasn’t come to the table to negotiate a plan for the season. “The Canadian government must stop criminalizing First Nations when they are exercising inherent, treaty, and court-affirmed rights,” said Kekinusuqs, Dr. Judith Sayers, president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council. “What is wrong with a government that fights against the people who want to stand on their own two feet? Has anybody ever realized that’s what’s actually happening?” said Wickaninnish, Cliff Atleo, Ahousaht First Nation’s lead fisheries negotiator and spokesperson for the T’aaq-wiihak fishery. The five nations work together to implement their right to a commercial fishery under the name T’aaq-wiihak. They want Canada to demonstrate a commitment to Bill C-15, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Act, which received Royal Assent June 21, with respect to their commercial fishery. T’aaq-wiihak nations want Canada’s government to prove that the intent of the legislation is more than just political lip service. On April 19, after almost two decades in the courts that reached to the highest levels, it was affirmed that DFO had been infringing on Nuu-chah-nulth commercial fishing rights. The decision came 11 years after an original court decision that affirmed the Nuu-chah-nulth Nations had proved their right to that commercial fishery and ordered the parties to negotiate. DFO has said they are collaborating with the five nations and reviewing the nations’ fisheries plans, but First Nations leaders insist there has been no such collaboration in the months since the April 19 court decision. Collaborating doesn’t mean consulting after decisions have been made, said Kekinusuqs. “Their idea of consulting really is to say, ‘this is your allocation for the year.’ Not even talk to us. Just this is the allocation and you have to live with it. That's not consultation or to ask what we think? Of course, we tell them what we think, and they don't change it. That's kind of the way they do business.” Collaborating means working together towards something, Kekinusuqs said, adding the nations in their dealings with DFO have leaned into the articles of UNDRIP for years and, particularly, the element of free, prior and informed consent. Kekinusuqs says the Nuu-chah-nulth have never given consent to an allocation from DFO. Bad faith negotiations have certain hallmarks, reads a Harvard Law School article, which includes the deliberate tactic of responding slowly and dragging out the negotiation process. By delaying implementation of a court-order to negotiate, DFO creates a situation where they can call any T’aaq-wiihak fishery “unauthorized,” Wickaninnish says. “Canada refuses to come to the table. If the federal government would meet us at the negotiating tables as directed by their own highest courts, our fisheries would no longer be ‘unauthorized’ in the eyes of the DFO,” said Wickaninnish. “They are ignoring the direction of their own courts, and now DFO is disrespecting the inherent authority of our Ha’wiih (hereditary leadership). We don’t have a formal agreement with the government of Canada,” said Wickaninnish. “We are our own nations with our own sovereignty. And our leadership is telling us to go out and fish.” On Aug. 5, the Ha’wiih of the five nations issued a declaration to authorize designated members to exercise the court-affirmed fishing right to harvest in line with allocations as set out in the nations’ fisheries plans. “DFO has been threatening fish buyers with charges if they work with our fishers,” said Wickaninnish. The press release also alleges that DFO threatened a third-party monitoring company with charges if it provided landing slips to the fishers. Racheal Weymer, director of Fisheries at Ecotrust Canada, the monitoring service provider for the five nations fishery, says DFO officers warned the organization on Aug. 18 that from that point onward issuing landing slips for the rights assertion fishery would be an illegal act. “It's not like there's a lot of buyers,” explained Wickaninnish. “But every one of them were visited by DFO, threatening them with a quarter million dollar fine if they bought our fish. A week before we had even caught our DFO sanctioned quota yet, they were already threatening the buyers.” Kekinusuqs said if charges were laid, that would start the whole court case all over again. Another hallmark of bad faith negotiation is not showing up with a mandate from the decision makers. “Minister (Bernadette) Jordan never personally handles negotiations. We had that call with her in July and everything we asked her about—whether it was a multi-year closure of the herring, the PSSI (Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative), and our commercial access to the fishery, she just listened and said, ‘Well, I'm going to have to talk to my staff about it’,” said Kekinusuqs. “She wouldn't answer anything. As the fisheries minister she should know these issues backwards and forwards and have an opinion, but she didn't.” Hereditary leadership meets with DFO every three months and they never send any high level officials to the meeting. Kekinusuqs says DFO tells the hereditary leaders it hears them and will take their concerns or needs to upper management, “but by then, you know, the fishing season is over. We've lost the opportunity. It's just frustrating, very maddening, you know, that this is how DFO always operates. We've never had a really good fisheries minister response to the work that we're doing.” “They never provide us with decision makers that could actually answer our questions.” Canada has not taken meaningful steps towards a collaborative negotiation process, instead choosing to run out the clock until after the 2021 election, notes the press release. “This should be an election issue, the access to the fishery. It's happening coast to coast,” says Kekinusuqs. The struggle of exercising fishing rights is not isolated to the five nations. “DFO recently arrested Chief Mike Sack of the Sipekne’katik First Nation, part of the Mi’kmaq, for being ‘party to the offence of (an) unauthorized fishery’,” reads the T’aaq-wiihak press release. Wickaninnish says the DFO strategy is an example of systemic racism. “When the commercial guys in Mi’kmaq country go out fishing there's 600,000 traps and DFO is crying about 3- 400 traps being put out by one nation because they've got a treaty right? That’s just racist.” Wickaninnish shared with Windspeaker.com the teachings passed from his father, Aw-op-waiik, Mark Atleo, in 1997 when he was 77. “In the last seven years of his life, he spoke of the hereditary system. ‘Mankind didn't create that system. It was a system gifted to us by the Creator for the purpose of looking after the ocean, land, resources and people all as one. Not separately. All as one.’ And so our governance system was a sacred system and it couldn't go wrong. For many thousands of years, all of the Indigenous people’s lives were rich. Not just our nation, but all Indigenous peoples of North and South America.” Kekinusuqs said she’s suspect of politicians and their promises of reconciliation. “It just shows people that they don't live up to their promises that they've been making all along. That First Nations are the most important relationship that they have. That they want to change their relationship. All of those kinds of things that should've changed, have not. We're just as (badly off) as we were 18 years ago when we commenced this whole court case,” she said. “As far as the election goes, if they wanted to have favour or First Nations’ support, they would have been implementing these decisions immediately.” Another hallmark of bad faith negotiation is the combination of extreme demands with small concessions. For Nuu-chah-nulth Nations, an example of an extreme demand is DFO authorizing a herring fishery when Nuu-chah-nulth nations said herring conservation took priority over commercial fishing. “We said ‘no way’, because we know if we fish this there won't be any herring in the future. Which has happened,” said Kekinusuqs. And, Nuu-chah-nulth fishers are familiar with the small concessions. “They did offer a small amount, but not enough for a reasonable livelihood as the courts said. So they might do small amounts– gestures, I would say. Beads and trinkets.” The T’aaq-wiihak fishermen get 10,000 pieces (salmon) they have to split among the five nations. “They give lots of allocations to the recreation and commercial fishery who only have a privilege in fishing, not a right, like we do.” When Nuu-chah-nulth fishers announced they were going to fish beyond their quota of 10,000 pieces, DFO gave the other fisheries in the area more allocation, Wickaninnish says. “That's how determined they are for us not to get a decent share.” “The whole system is rigged against us,” said Wickaninnish. “Because we're Indigenous, coast to coast to coast. ‘Keep ‘em down. Keep their foot on our throat. Don't dare lift it up. Don't dare to provide any kind of Indigenous viewpoint on what reconciliation is.’ In other words, just keep them down at all costs. But we're going to carry on the fight. We're not going to stop our fight.” “When you think about it, seriously, their intention is to get rid of us. We're still here, and there's a reason for that.” Windspeaker.com Subject: Leadership; Collaboration; Bad faith; Fishing; Negotiations; Fisheries; Native North Americans; Fish; Commercial fishing"

"2021-08-30","Full text: A high turnover rate is expected across Alberta for the upcoming municipal elections Oct. 18. Former-Alberta Urban Municipalities of Alberta (AUMA)President Barry Morishita said it has been tough to be a municipal councillor over the last few years and that may be contributing to lower re-election rates across the province. “COVID-19 has made it difficult, and quite frankly the conversations have happened on social media and some of the division that's been created. It's difficult to be an elected official at the municipal level,” Morishita said. A lot of mayors in the mid-sized cities and larger cities, such as Edmonton and Calgary, are not running again, which will result in a loss of veteran leadership across the province. On the bright side, Morishita said there is a lot of potential for new leadership to rise to the occasion. Many councillors who may not sit in the mayor’s chair and have the spotlight on them now have a chance to lead their communities. Morishita, the mayor of Brooks, has been a municipal councillor for the last 16 of 22 years, with seven elections under his belt. He said there has never been so much negativity around being a local elected official. “I've been trying to get people to run in my city … but they see what happens on social media … and they just don’t want to do it,” Morishita said. “You have to deal with your social media and have to deal with people that say things about you.” The intensity and scrutiny of the job has never been higher and not in a productive way, Morishita said. Mayor Ted Clugston of Medicine Hat said it has been a ""horrific"" year because of COVID-19 and he understands why councillors aren't running again. ""It's vicious and COVID-19 proved it,"" Clugston said. Most mayors and councillors can make more money in the private sector and work normal hours with a decent life, Clugston said, who added he is running again because he has many projects he wants to tackle still for Medicine Hat. Having to make health-care decisions as a mayor and wade into health decisions was stressful, Clugston said, ""You wouldn't want me to tell you what heart medication to take, but yet you wanted me to tell you whether to wear a mask or not and, in my opinion, was that the right thing for your health,"" Clugston said. ""It was a health emergency, not a municipal emergency."" Mayors got pressured to declare states of emergency because they wanted to calm the panic in the communities. The decision on what to do with masks and COVID-19 tore councils apart. Along with dealing with negativity on social media and battling COVID-19, many people go into municipal politics expecting it to be a part-time job, but it ends up being a much bigger time commitment than they anticipated. Many people go in trying to balance their full-time job with serving on council, and it can be a shock to find out it isn’t just a part-time gig, Morishita said, although some people grow into the role and will love it. “But lots of people, you know, they have other demands. They either have young families or they have other jobs, and I think that certainly is a factor,” Morishita said. “The demands are higher, as well as the accountability is higher. People are paying more attention.” Many people look at the stress of the job and decide to choose another path to serve their community without having to be in the spotlight. For some council members, they are labelled as part-time employees and work closer to full-time hours, but don’t get compensated for their time. “It prevents a lot of people from doing the job,” Morishita said. Working professionals often aren't compensated enough for losing wages at their primary jobs to financially offset joining a council for lower pay. “Then the pool gets smaller because a full-time worker can't do a good job in the time that they have, and if they could get paid more, then they could kind of give up more on the other income to balance it out,” Morishita said. Councillor turnover can also be an issue. If many councillors in one community turn over at the same time, it may take a long time for a council to get started on executing their priorities. In some races in the province there is expected to be some significant turnover, where three-quarters or more of the elected officials will not be running again, and Morishita said he believes those places are going to be disadvantaged at least in the early months of the term. “It takes a long time to get going. It's a different arena if you've never been a municipal councillor,” Morishita said. In Okotoks, Morishita said only one councillor, Tanya Thorn, has announced she is running for mayor, after their current major Bill Robertson announced he wasn’t running again and then tragically passed away. The rest of council has yet to declare whether they are running, and Morishita said they expect almost the entire council to turn over to new candidates. Many of the councillors in Okotoks have been on council for a long time, Morishita said, and there hasn’t been one thing driving them not to run again, but rather they have all served several terms and are ready to move on. Clugston said if there is an inexperienced mayor on council with a lot of candidates running on poliarizing issues, such as the fallout from COVID-19, it could tear the council apart with everybody wanting to go in different directions. ""The job of the mayor is to build consensus,"" Clugston said. ""I think it will be tough for that first year to have a completely new council.""

"2021-08-30","Full text: An organization advocating for the health of Lake Winnipeg hopes that when federal candidates come calling and seeking votes in the coming days and weeks, that Manitobans make it clear that the health of the environment and of this province’s largest lake are topics that must be top-of-mind. “I know candidates and voters are going to want to talk about the economy, and the pandemic, and health care, but ultimately water is the most precious resource we have on this planet, and we’re fortunate to have an abundance of lakes here in Manitoba,” Gordon Campbell said over the phone on Friday morning from his Lester Beach cottage. “Unfortunately our lakes are under constant attack by the impacts of changing land use, waste disposal, hydroelectric power generation, shoreline development, and other human uses of water.” Campbell is one of the members of the Coalition to Save Lake Winnipeg, (CSLW) an organized group of Manitobans who own cabins and properties along different areas of Lake Winnipeg. The coalition is now asking Manitobans to ask any federal candidate who seeks their votes a number of specific questions about what can be done on the federal level to address the health of the lake, while also addressing larger issues of environmental sustainability and climate change. In a Facebook post by Campbell on August 25, he urged Manitobans to discuss the major environmental issues currently facing Lake Winnipeg with candidates, including the ongoing issues of algae bloom growth, and of invasive zebra mussels. “Over the next weeks candidates in Manitoba’s 14 federal ridings may be contacting you to request your support,” Cambell said in his post. “Engaging the candidates in a conversation about water and how they will support sustainable practices for the health of Manitoba’s waterways will highlight the need for this to be a priority for government attention. You can ask your candidates to look beyond their party’s plan to consider the needs of our province and the waterways they can protect.” Campbell said he believes the two most pressing issues for Lake Winnipeg are currently the algae blooms and the zebra mussels. Campbell knows the extent of the zebra mussel issue first-hand, as he is one of many volunteers at Lester Beach, which sits about 15 km north of Grand Beach, who spends summer mornings cleaning the thousands of zebra mussels off of the shores of the beach, just so beachgoers can be comfortable. He said the mussels also “clear out the lake,” leading to clearer water, which allows sunlight to penetrate deeper and support more algae growth. And Campbell said he has known the extent of the algae bloom issue for years, as every summer the water in the lake on some days can turn a bright green because of the blooms, and when it’s like that he said it is not safe for swimming or any activities. Campbell said CSLW has also prepared a list of four specific questions that they will send to each candidate in all of Manitoba’s federal ridings, and are hoping to get a response from candidates by September 10, ten days before the planned September 20 election. — Dave Baxter is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the Winnipeg Sun.

Approximately 3,000 people were killed in the four crashes, including two dozen Canadians. The attacks were blamed on Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, who was living in Afghanistan under the protection of that country's Taliban government.

Steven Fletcher had been kicked out of the provincial Progressive Conservative caucus for publicly breaking with the party on a number of policies, including voting against a bill to create a Crown corporation on Energy efficiency. In 2019, Justin Trudeau began his bid for re-election by framing the 40-day campaign as a time for Canadians to make a choice: whether they want more of his sunny ways or a return to the gloomier days he says are characteristic of life under a Conservative government. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the election would come down to a clear question for voters: Who can you count on? Green party Leader Elizabeth May said her party was hoping to capitalize on interest in tackling climate change, as well as a growing number of Green politicians elected in recent provincial votes. Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Fancois Blanchet said voters in Quebec had flirted with three parties in recent years, none of whom has done enough for the province."

Originally it was thought that Canada's role would be to supply war materiel to Britain, which had declared war seven days earlier, and Prime Minister Mackenzie King took a stand against conscription. But by 1940, 500,000 Canadians had enlisted and when Japan entered the war a year later, King held a plebiscite which allowed him to begin the draft. In total, almost 42,000 Canadian service personnel died in the Second World War. In 1945, Norwegian premier Vidkun Quisling was sentenced to death for collaborating with the Nazis.

In 1989, Hungary granted permission to thousands of East German refugees to cross into Austria despite protests from East German authorities. It helped precipitate the fall of the Berlin Wall two months later and the end of Communist rule throughout Eastern Europe. In 1999, ""HMCS Huron"" nabbed a ship carrying 150 to 170 Chinese illegal immigrants in Nootka Sound, off the west coast of Vancouver Island. It was the fourth such capture in less than two months, increasing the total number of Chinese boat people that summer to more than 600. In 2000, Tiger Woods won the Canadian Open golf championship at Glen Abbey golf course in Oakville, Ont.

In 2011, an estimated 100,000 people, including Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, attended a memorial ceremony at the Lokomotiv ice arena honouring the 36 players, coaches and staff of the Russian team that perished in a plane crash on Sept. 7. (Alexander Galimov, the lone player who survived the initial impact, died on Sept. 12.) In 2013, the minority Quebec government released its proposals for a ""values charter"" aimed at restricting religious clothing and symbols worn by employees at all government institutions. The proposals set off a storm of controversy. (The bill died after the Parti Quebecois lost the April 2014 election to the Liberal Party.) In 2013, a court in India convicted four men of the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus, an attack that set off waves of protests and gave voice to years of anger over the treatment of women. They were sentenced to hang but the Supreme Court stayed their executions pending appeals. (There were two other suspects - one was found dead in his cell in an apparent suicide while the other was convicted in juvenile court and sentenced to three years in a reform home.)

In 2019, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson formally suspended Parliament and sent rebellious lawmakers home until two weeks before the country was supposed to exit the European Union on Oct. 31. Lawmakers used the hours before the suspension to deliver new blows to Johnson's authority. An opposition-backed measure designed to stop Britain from leaving the E.U. without a deal became law after receiving the formal assent of Queen Elizabeth II. That came hours before legislators rejected Johnson's demand for a snap election to break the political deadlock engulfing the government. Speaker John Bercow, whose control of business in the House of Commons made him a central player in the Brexit drama, announced he would step down after a decade in the job. In 2020, Canada's election watchdog said former finance minister Bill Morneau broke the law when he promoted Liberal candidates at government-funded events he attended as finance minister. Commissioner Yves Cote said Morneau broke a section of the Elections Act that prohibits anyone but individuals from donating to political parties. One candidate who appeared with Morneau at multiple events in 2019, Anita Anand, went on to become the federal procurement minister. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: State elections; Professional golf; EU membership; Prime ministers"

The Royal Air Force prevented invasion during 1940, but the civilian population endured years of bombing before the tide of war turned. In 1952, the Canadian liner ""Princess Kathleen"" ran aground and sank off Lena Point, Alaska. Her 300 passengers and crew of 115 were all rescued. The incident occurred during the highest tide of the season, and it was the falling tide that sank her. In 1958, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that any attack on China would be regarded as an attack on the Soviet Union. In 1959, Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis died in Schefferville, Que.

The entire Lokomotiv team perished, including Canadian coach Brad McCrimmon and former NHL players Pavol Demitra, Josef Vasicek, Karel Rachunek, Karlis Skrastins and Ruslan Salei. The crash put Russia's troubled aviation industry in the spotlight but investigators later blamed it on pilot error.

In 2018, the last man to emerge from a shattered mine in Springhill, N.S., decades earlier died at age 95.

In 2019, Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu (an-DRESS'-koo) upset Serena Williams 6-3, 7-5 in the U.S. Open final. It wasn't just the 19-year-old's first Grand Slam title -- it was the first Grand Slam win for a Canadian. Andreescu's victory prevented Williams from claiming what would have been her record-tying 24th major singles championship. Two days later, the new WTA rankings were released, vaulting Andreescu into a career high Number 5 spot. In 2020, New Brunswick's Progressive Conservative leader dropped one of his candidates after learning the man had re-posted a Facebook message containing transphobic language. Blaine Higgs said he was disturbed by the re-posting of a transphobic meme by Roland Michaud. It suggested physical violence against transgender women when they use restrooms. Michaud apologized for circulating the meme, but said he didn't intend to withdraw his name from the race. --- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Fisheries; Diplomatic & consular services; Language policy; World War II; Aviation; Provincial elections; Earthquakes; Alzheimers disease"

Union leaders released statements declaring that revolution was under way in Poland. In 1987, SaskWest Television became the first television company in Canada to put out two simultaneous air signals in two different cities, Regina and Saskatoon. In 1990, one of Canada's biggest political upsets saw Ontario elect its first NDP government. Bob Rae's New Democrats ousted David Peterson's Liberals, winning 74 of 130 seats. The Rae government lasted only one term, losing the 1995 election to the Conservatives under Mike Harris. In 1991, the Soviet Union granted full independence to the three Baltic republics -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Another legacy of Communist rule also disappeared -- parliament voted to restore the pre-Bolshevik name of St. Petersburg to the country's second-largest city -- Leningrad. In 1995, Dudley George, one of a group of aboriginal protesters occupying Ipperwash Provincial Park on Lake Huron in Ontario, was shot dead by police. The protesters were claiming the park occupied a sacred burial ground. (A police officer was later convicted of criminal negligence causing death). In 1995, Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. eclipsed Yankee great Lou Gehrig's ironman record by playing in his 2,131st straight game. (Ripken extended the record to 2,632 games before sitting out a game against the Yankees on Sept. 21, 1998.) In 1997, about one million people lined the streets of London as the funeral procession of Diana, Princess of Wales, made its journey from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey. For the first time in history, the Union Jack flew at half-staff above Buckingham Palace to mark the passing of someone who was not a member of the royal family. In 1998, in the first dynastic succession in any Communist country, Kim Jong-il was entrenched officially as North Korea's supreme leader, heading the state, the military and the governing Workers party. In 2005, California’s State Assembly became the first legislative body in the U.S. to approve same-sex marriages, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger later vetoed the bill. In 2005, Eugenia Charles, former prime minister of Dominica, the world’s first black female head of a country, died at age 86. In 2007, Italian Opera legend Luciano Pavarotti died after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 71. In 2009, Maj. Yannick Pepin, 36, and Cpl. Jean-François Drouin, 31, both members of the 5 Combat Engineer Regiment who were stationed in Valcartier, Que., were killed when a roadside bomb hit their armoured vehicle in the Dand district southwest of Kandahar city in Afghanistan. In 2011, Germany's top criminal court threw out the tax evasion conviction of former arms-industry lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber and ordered a retrial after saying errors were made in the 2010 process. The German-Canadian former arms industry lobbyist had been extradited to Germany after an Ontario court denied his bid to stay in Canada following public hearings into his controversial financial dealings with former prime minister Brian Mulroney. (In late 2013, he was again found guilty and sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison.) In 2011, former media baron Conrad Black returned to a low security Miami prison to complete the last 13 months of his sentence. He had been free on bail for about a year after an appeal court reversed two of his three fraud convictions. In 2011, a man with an AK-47 assault rifle shot a group of five uniformed National Guard members eating breakfast at a Nevada restaurant, killing three of them and another person. Seven others were wounded. The suspect shot himself and later died at a hospital. In 2014, former federal cabinet minister Jim Prentice won the Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership race to become premier-designate, replacing Alison Redford who had resigned amid a travel expense scandal. On Oct. 27, Prentice won a seat in the legislature as his party won four provincial byelections. (In May 2015, the NDP won the Alberta election, toppling the PC dynasty and driving Prentice from politics.) In 2017, the Bank of Canada raised its overnight lending rate to 1.0 per cent, its second quarter-point increase since July. In 2017, Category 5 hurricane Irma, the strongest Atlantic Ocean hurricane ever recorded with wind gusts of 298 km, made landfall as it passed the Caribbean islands of Antigua and Barbuda. Its 640-km path continued over Puerto Rico and Cuba before slamming the Gulf Coast of Florida as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 10 and weakening to a tropical depression through the U.S. southeast. Irma killed 38 people in the Caribbean and another 36 in the U.S. In 2018, India's Supreme Court struck down a colonial-era law that made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a landmark victory for gay rights that one judge said would ""pave the way for a better future."" In 2018, film and TV star Burt Reynolds died at age 82. Reynolds enjoyed a prolific career with a mix of critically acclaimed roles including ""Deliverance"" and ""Boogie Nights"" and commercial hits such as ""The Cannonball Run"" and ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He won an Emmy for the TV series ""Evening Shade."" In 2018, a powerful earthquake on Japan's main northern island of Hokkaido triggered dozens of landslides that crushed houses under torrents of dirt, rocks and timber. After days of searches, Japanese authorities said 41 people had been killed and more than 650 were injured. In 2018, a Dallas police officer shot and killed a 26-year-old man in his own apartment. Amber Guyger said she mistook his apartment for her own home and believed he was a burglar. Guyger was charged three days later with manslaughter and was fired on Sept. 24. In 2018, a computer programmer who was working at the behest of the North Korean government was charged in connection with several massive cyberattacks, including the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 and the WannaCry ransomware attack that affected hundreds of thousands of computers. In 2019, Robert Mugabe, who governed Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced to resign in 2017, died at 95. Mugabe took a country shining with the promise of independence and left it economically shattered and in the grip of repression. There was mixed reaction in Zimbabwe to the news of his death, with some blaming him for the country's economic turmoil and human rights violations and others saying life got worse after he left office. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Explorers; Earthquakes; Lobbyists; Assassinations & assassination attempts; Political leadership; Prime ministers"

"2021-08-29","Full text: The City of Mississauga is calling on parties and candidates looking to win any of its six seats in September’s federal election to commit to a wide-ranging list of priorities. Staff and councillors are reprising the Mississauga Matters campaign, rolled out during the 2018 provincial and 2019 federal elections, to push for specific promises to move crucial city building forward. Priorities include big-ticket transit projects like funding the Hurontario LRT loop around downtown, cancelled by the Ontario PC government, and two-way, all-day service on the Milton GO line. “Mississauga needs a committed federal government partner to provide consistent, predictable, direct and long-term funding to allow us to build Mississauga into a world-class city and effectively recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” a May 2021 staff report outlining the strategy explained. Funding for the Port Credit Marina, public parks and active transportation are part of the campaign. As is a bus rapid transit route along Dundas Street and resources for zero-emissions transit. More general housing policies and significant business support for post-COVID recovery plans will be pushed forward too. Federal dollars are key to Mississauga’s future growth. The municipal government is responsible for a huge infrastructure portfolio, including roads, community centres and libraries, much of which is rapidly aging. Plans to move towards a transit-oriented future, develop a world-class waterfront and keep municipally-owned facilities in working order all heavily rely on funds flowing from higher levels of government. “Municipalities own 60 percent of all infrastructure in Canada, yet only receive nine cents of every tax dollar collected, compared to approximately 44 cents for the province and 47 cents for the federal government,” the City’s staff report says. “Municipalities like Mississauga need the federal (and provincial) government to provide more long-term, predictable funding for infrastructure.” As a rapidly growing community, Mississauga is at a crossroads. More than half of the City’s infrastructure was built at least 30 years ago and is in desperate need of repairs. Ambitious plans to green its transit fleet, increase public transport usage through convenient rapid transit lines and end Mississauga’s reliance on the car cannot be achieved through debt-financing, development fees and the property tax alone. The City is currently awaiting the result of applications for federal support to build the Dundas BRT and green its bus fleet. Other requests like the downtown loop are key to its future, but don’t qualify for an existing federal grant. Mississauga Matters, the City’s attempt to ask for its fair share, is being blasted across social media, promoted through paid advertising and open letters, among other options. One tactic to test local candidates' commitment to Mississauga is missing: a city-wide debate."
"2021-08-29","Full text: As the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Ontario continues to trend upward, it is doing so as many families are focused on a return to school with kids under the age of 12 not yet eligible for a vaccine – and it is also doing so in the heat of a Federal election where vaccine policy has become a central issue. Last week, Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health issued a directive mandating hospitals and home and community care service providers to have a COVID-19 vaccination policy for employees, staff, contractors, students and volunteers, including personal support workers (PSWs). “This is similar to vaccination policy requirements currently in place for long-term care homes,” said the Province in a statement. “Vaccination policies will also be implemented in other higher-risk settings where personal support workers and direct support workers provide care, including licensed retirement homes, congregate group homes and day programs for adults with developmental disabilities, children’s treatment centres and other services for children with special needs, and licensed children’s residential settings.” The Province’s roll-out of new targeted vaccine policies coincided with many large Canadian companies announcing they would require proof of vaccine for many employees and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau floating the idea of requiring civil servants to be vaccinated as well. This was contrasted with Conservative leader Erin O’Toole stating rapid testing would be a better course of action for Federal workers. Here at home, opinions varied among the individuals vying to be the next Members of Parliament for Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill and Newmarket-Aurora. AURORA-OAK RIDGES-RICHMOND HILL “COVID-19 has had a serious effect on the health and well-being of all Canadians,” says incumbent Conservative candidate Leona Alleslev. “We must do everything we can to overcome the virus, end the pandemic and recover our communities and our economy. Dr. Tam declared Canada was in the fourth wave of the pandemic on 14 August, three days before Justin Trudeau called this unnecessary election. Vaccination offers the greatest protection for our citizens and our community. All Canadians are encouraged to get both doses of the vaccine. “The policy position of both the Liberal and Conservative party is centred around requiring vaccination or accommodation through means of rapid testing.” Liberal candidate Leah Taylor Roy, however, says she believes mandatory vaccination for public servants, and air and train passengers is a “necessary step further” towards ending the pandemic. “My family and I are proud to be fully vaccinated because we know vaccines work,” says Ms. Taylor Roy. “Just follow the science – Public Health Ontario has reported that 95.2 per cent of COVID-19 cases were in unvaccinated individuals, with similar trends for hospitalizations and deaths. “We all pay for our health care system. We don’t need to spend more money on rapid tests when we have a safe way to fight COVID-19 right now. Our incredible health care workers across the country have been begging Canadians to get the vaccine, and after 18 months they deserve a break. “Ending this pandemic is in our hands now and we need to be firm.” NEWMARKET-AURORA NDP candidate Yvonne Kelly says she is in favour of mandatory vaccines, with exceptions based on religious beliefs or health conditions. “The precedent is already set where vaccines are concerned,” she says. “Our children cannot attend public schools unless they have up-to-date immunization records, of course with minor exceptions, and this is a plan we have been working with for decades. Overall public health concerns and collective well-being have to be our guiding objective. “Increasingly, public and private organizations and institutions are also requiring mandatory vaccines for participation which reflects the growing belief that in order for them to function safely as public entities they are acknowledging the need for vaccines. I do not, however, want to see mandatory [measures] resulting in a risk for the criminalization of those who are not vaccinated so the details on how we implement this is important. “For communities, there are legitimate concerns and consistent public education about the value and safety of vaccinations is the answer. Also, we must recognize that access to vaccinations is not the same for all communities; all measures must be taken to ensure it is possible for everyone to receive the vaccine. In the case of civil servants and travellers, which falls under Federal jurisdiction, mandatory vaccines with limited exceptions should apply.” Conservative candidate Harold Kim, however, offered an opposing viewpoint. “Adult Canadians are not children and can make their own decisions, not have them dictated,” he said. “That is why Erin O’Toole’s Conservatives won’t mandate everyone to be vaccinated if they choose not to do so. However, it has been pointed out that there is really no difference between Justin Trudeau’s stance on vaccinations and Erin O’Toole’s. Justin Trudeau has provided that those who refuse vaccination will need to consider alternative measures such as testing and screening. “The Conservatives believe that those who don’t get vaccinated will be required to undergo rapid testing to protect our must vulnerable Canadians. Unvaccinated Canadian passengers will be required to present a recent negative test result or pass a rapid test before getting on a bus, train, plane or ship, and federal public servants who are not vaccinated will need to pass a daily rapid test. The policies are the same. This is just another example of the Liberals misleading the public yet again. Except this election, the public knows better. “There is no doubt that vaccines are the most important tool in the fight against COVID-19 and we encourage every Canadian who can get vaccinated, to do so.” Liberal incumbent Tony Van Bynen, like Ms. Kelly, has also voiced support for mandatory vaccines for civil servants. “I am absolutely in favour of vaccine requirements for our Federal workforce and for folks who want to board planes, trains and ships here in Canada,” he says. “Any company, organization, or province that wants to put their own vaccine requirements in place also has my full support. We already require vaccines for a whole range of other diseases, so I am not sure why this one would be any different. “If someone chooses not to get vaccinated, that’s obviously their right, but it doesn’t mean they should then be able to get on an airplane and put everyone else on board at risk.” Subject: Public health; Conservatism; COVID-19 vaccines; Canadians; Coronaviruses; Immunization; Pandemics"
"2021-08-29","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Aug. 27 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 27 ... What we are watching in Canada ... OTTAWA — Canada's military mission in Afghanistan ended Thursday, leaving an unknown number of Canadians and their families trapped just hours before suicide bombers staged a ""complex attack"" on crowds at the airport in Kabul, killing more than a dozen U.S. soldiers and nearly 100 local Afghans. The withdrawal occurred as Canada and its military allies were bracing for imminent attack and to allow for the American-led mission to eventually meet its Aug. 31 deadline for departure. U.S. officials said 13 U.S. service members were killed in the attack, which began with a pair of blasts near a crowded entry gate, followed by gunmen opening fire on the crowd. At least 90 local Afghans — all of them hoping to escape the country — were also killed. Another 18 U.S. military members were injured. An unknown number of Canadian military personnel stayed behind to assist the American withdrawal, and all were ""safe and accounted for"" after the Thursday bombing, the Canadian Forces said on Twitter. Gen. Wayne Eyre, the acting chief of the defence staff, said Canadians were among the last to leave Afghanistan, that military personnel are taking the withdrawal personally and many will feel guilty that they had to leave people behind. He noted Canada brought roughly 3,700 people out of the country, which fell to the Taliban earlier this month. Eyre said the airport was under constant threat of attack and Canada and its allies acted admirably. --- Also this ... The Liberal and NDP leaders are expected to be in Ontario for Day 13 of the federal election campaign, while the head of the Conservatives is to spend time in two Atlantic provinces. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is to make an announcement in Mississauga, Ont., before meeting with supporters in Bolton, Ont. New Democrat boss Jagmeet Singh will be in the northern Ontario community of Thunder Bay, where he will make a health-care announcement in the morning. Later in the day, he's scheduled to meet with regional First Nations leaders, then visit supporters at a local bakery before going to the Thunder Bay-Rainy River campaign office. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole is to make an announcement in Corner Brook, N.L., and then head to Sydney, N.S., to attend an event with supporters. On Thursday, the crisis in Afghanistan, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, dominated the campaign agendas of the party leaders. --- And this ... Todd Lewis considers himself lucky. The farmer lives in a part of Saskatchewan that received enough rain to yield an average crop, which is the best he could hope for on a day in late July. This summer was marked by some of the worst drought seen in decades, which came after a winter where not much snow fell, leaving fields with little soil moisture. ""It's not even hot and windy, it's just hot,"" said Lewis, sitting on the deck of his house about a half-hour drive south of Regina, where he is the fourth generation of his family to farm that land,growing canola, durum and canary seed. Like most everyone in farming, the president of the Agricultural Producers of Saskatchewan is used to changing skies and tough seasons. But experts warn climate change means extreme weather events are set to become more common in the years to come. For environmental leaders, this summer's deadly heat wave and wildfires in British Columbia, combined with drought across the Prairies, could shape how voters think about the issue in the Sept. 20 federal election. ""Climate change has been completely broken out of its environmental pigeonhole,"" said Rick Smith, president of the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices. ""For many more Canadians than before, climate change is about the health and well-being of their families right now, as opposed to some distant concern at some point in the future."" The Climate Action Network reported around 63 per cent of voters cast a ballot for federal parties with ""strong climate platforms"" in the last election. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... A closely watched forecasting model in the United States is projecting the country will see nearly 100,000 more COVID-19 deaths between now and Dec. 1. But health experts say that toll could be cut in half if nearly everyone wore a mask in public spaces. Experts agree: What the coronavirus has in store this fall depends on human behavior. And early signs suggest behavior changes may already be flattening the curve in a few places where the virus raged this summer."
"2021-08-29","Full text: When he first took his seat in the House of Commons in 2019, former Newmarket mayor Tony Van Bynen wanted to be a voice for the people of Newmarket-Aurora. Just a few months later, however, things went sideways with the global pandemic. Priorities that were not directly related to health and measures related to COVID-19 were put on the backburner, and now that the country is in the midst of another Federal election, he says this election is about laying the foundation “for the important” things in the longer term. “This election and the next term will be more about recovery than the response,” says Mr. Van Bynen of the pandemic. “I think the response was important, I think we’re making progress, and now it is about laying the foundation for the important things in the longer-term. Those are the things that have become a priority. For me, it is a case of the government understanding what is important to Newmarket-Aurora and Newmarket-Aurora understanding what is in the national interest as well. “I don’t think my objectives have changed, but how we can go about doing that, and the timelines, I think, have changed quite significantly.” As a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada, Mr. Van Bynen says he is proud to stand on his party’s record. He places particular pride in the Liberal government’s support for community-centred not-for-profit organizations, efforts to get them back on their feet in the recovery stage of COVID, and significant investments in social enterprise. He also places pride in Liberal leader Justin Trudeau and what Mr. Van Bynen describes as his ability “to bring the country together.” “Leadership is about bringing the country together, not dividing it,” he says. “If there was anything I saw in the last 18 months, it’s how the country got together. It’s how we were able to collaborate at the Federal, Provincial, Municipal and local levels.” Collaboration with all levels of government will be key should the Liberals once again form government on September 20. As the party rolls out its platform, Mr. Van Bynen says planks related to childcare and health care will have a significant impact on the community, as will continued proposals for job recovery. “We have made great progress,” he says. I think 92 per cent of the jobs lost [due to the pandemic] have been recovered, but what does that mean in the long term? What does it mean for youth? I want to make sure that what I have heard [in the riding] is heard in Ottawa and that is to make sure we transition to a green recovery and we need to make sure we don’t leave anybody behind. I think this pandemic has shown us some of the vulnerabilities in our society, some racialized, marginalized communities and minority groups, and we have to make sure the recovery itself considers everybody.” He is also happy to take proposals related to relief for students, opportunities for entrepreneurs to pursue manufacturing and/or jobs that are focused on zero emissions to residents door-to-door, and pursue partnerships with the province to “help hospitals respond to the tremendous growth we have had.” “Apart from the policy items, I am quite proud of the fact that we have established a very active youth group to get people engaged and to make sure that politics isn’t just something you read in the newspaper; it is something that is going to affect all of us and I think a lot of people have seen how dramatic that impact is,” he says. “I spent a lot of time understanding issues with the Indigenous communities and I want to create greater awareness. That is part of our policy, but I don’t think it was as top-of-mind in Newmarket-Aurora as it might have been and now we understand those situations. Creating a fair and just society, I think, is something that I would like to see as a legacy for our communities as we go forward.” While Mr. Van Bynen characterizes his first Federal campaign a year-and-a-half ago as one of “learning” – “Capital ‘L’ – capitalize the whole thing if you want!” – as it was a campaign significantly different from a mayoral bid, the issues, he says, also run significantly deeper. Now, in his second Federal campaign, he is hitting the ground running. “I am really excited about what is possible if we take the time and we have the courage to be bold and go forward,” he says. “I think there will be clear choices in terms of what Canada will look like as we go forward and one that is being put forward by the Liberal party is very consistent with my values and, I think, the values that people see in me.” Subject: Local elections; Collaboration; Pandemics; COVID-19"
"2021-08-29","Full text: As families gear up for a return to school this September, attention on the Federal campaign trail has turned to child care with the two leading parties offering different visions of how to provide child care to Canadian families. The two leading parties – the Liberals and Conservatives – have announced competing viewpoints, with the Conservatives favouring a tax credit to allow families to make the best choice for them, while the Liberals and NDP have proposed a more “universal” approach to child care. Here is how the candidates vying to be the next MPs for Newmarket-Aurora and Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill view the issue. NEWMARKET-AURORA NDP candidate Yvonne Kelly says an NDP government will work with the Provinces to create a “universal system” that will offer $10 a day childcare spaces for families “regardless of where they live.” “The positive impacts [of this] will be felt by families immediately because a universal system will provide affordable childcare and the spots necessary so families don’t have to wait for months to return to work,” she says. “It will also relieve a tremendous amount of stress I know parents experience when their future is so uncertain. I have colleagues and friends who have been looking for childcare spaces since before their infants were born and even now when they are ready to return to work, have not been able to find childcare that is accessible to them. Delaying a return to work for families when most need two incomes to pay their bills and remain housed is not acceptable when we can create the spaces we need. This is now our most complicated issue by far. Political will is the determining factor in getting this done.” Ms. Kelly describes the Conservative plan to introduce a tax credit to help families find childcare as a proposal that does nothing to create new childcare spaces or make childcare more affordable, but Conservative candidate Harold Kim says the Conservative plan will “enable more women to choose to participate in the workforce” through providing this break. “This allows families to choose the type of childcare that’s right for their family, without penalizing them for not choosing where Trudeau would like you to send your children,” he said. “Families are tired of being told what’s best for them by governments and Trudeau’s plan is an expensive Ottawa-knows-best approach. Conservatives know that Canadians are smarter than that. And as the Liberals have made childcare promises in eight previous elections since 1993 and never delivered, I leave it to you to think about the chances of it even happening.” Mr. Kim says he wonders why it has taken the Liberal leader so long to make announcements on childcare, just in time for a “critical election” and says he has not seen anything that indicates more childcare spaces will be created through the Liberal proposal. “The Conservative childcare plan brings Canadians back into the decision-making about their families, their health, their environment,” he says. “Taxes in Canada are the highest in the world. Imposing tax after tax to pay for things that people didn’t ask for, for failed and ineffective programs, for Trudeau’s family and friends to enjoy the high life is what Conservatives object to most. A tax credit is a clear and direct financial benefit to Canadian families, to help them cope through the high cost of raising families in Canada today.” But Liberal candidate Tony Van Bynen says his party’s plan to bring childcare costs down to $10 a day was developed in collaboration “with some of the country’s leading childcare and economic policy experts.” “It’s investing up to $30 billion in the next five years, and at least $9.2 billion/year every year after, to create new spaces and bring down costs for families,” he says. “It’s a plan that has support from business leaders, major charities, and childcare advocates from right across the country. It’s the most effective way to do this, and in the last few months — regardless of what my friends of an orange persuasion might try to claim — we’ve kept our promise and signed agreements with nearly every province and territory to make $10/day childcare a reality. I fully expect the Ford government here in Ontario to sign on after the election. The Conservative plan would cancel the agreements that have already been signed, and replace them with a tax credit scheme that will benefit the wealthiest folks while leaving the ones who need this support the most paying more than they would under our plan. “Simply put, the best way to foster new spaces is to have the federal government put up the money required to create those spaces. Our plan, as confirmed by childcare policy experts, will create more than 125,000 new regulated spaces. Tax credits won’t do that. Anyone who has had to put their kids into childcare knows just how incredibly expensive it is. Our plan will allow parents in our community to know their kids will be taken care of without wondering how they’re going to pay for it. That also has some pretty significant economic upside, as well, because every dollar you invest in child care has a return of between $1.50 and $2.80 in economic growth, and helps more and more young parents — women, in particular — be able to go back to work.” AURORA-OAK RIDGES-RICHMOND HILL For Conservative candidate Leona Alleslev, providing “accessible and affordable” child care is a priority. “Canada simply doesn’t have enough spaces and they are too expensive,” she says. “Ontario cities have the highest median cost at over $21,000 per year for an infant. In Ontario, there are only enough regulated centre spaces for approximately 20% of children under five years, and very few of them are subsidized. Worse still, there are even fewer spaces that support parents who work part time, have irregular schedules or are shift workers. The Conservative plan represents an immediate step in the right direction. A refundable tax credit that won’t take five years to implement and will offer increased support right away to all families to offset the high costs of childcare. It will also create additional spaces because as it becomes more affordable for families to access these services, more home based and regulated child care providers will be established. “COVID 19 has shown that the nature, routine and pace of work is likely to change after the pandemic requiring a wider array of childcare options that address flexible work schedules and shift work. As someone who operated two small businesses and worked as an aircraft manufacturing manager, I know how challenging it is to find childcare that can meet the demands of work schedules that are unpredictable and change daily. I will work to expand the Conservative Party childcare policy to include incentives for businesses and provinces to partner with childcare providers to deliver spaces that offer increased flexibility to meet the needs of their workforce.” As the mother of six in a blended family, Liberal candidate Leah Taylor Roy says she too understands the “demands” of parenting and says her party’s plan to build “high quality, affordable and flexible early learning and child care system” across the country is “the best path forward. “While I am glad to see the Conservative Party has addressed child care in their platform, their plan is a half-measure that does not address universal child care, the importance of quality early learning and the equally critical issue of the lack of supply,” says Ms. Taylor Roy. “The Conservative Party’s proposed tax credit won’t help when parents cannot get their kids into child care in the first place. “We have many young and growing families in Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill. The demand for spaces is so high that we are seeing families apply for child care spots as soon as they find out they’re pregnant. Finding quality child care that’s close to home shouldn’t have to feel like playing the lottery. The Liberal Party’s plan would lead to the creation of over 125,000 new child care spaces in the next five years across Canada. We will invest up to $30 billion dollars and work with child care providers across the country to make this a reality. Parents today should be able to participate in the workforce feeling confident that their children are well-cared for and thriving in quality affordable child care centres and homes.” Subject: Parents & parenting; Families & family life; Conservatism; Children & youth; Child care; Costs; Tax credits; Early childhood education; Elections; Political parties; Workforce"

Currie Dixon says in an open letter that Dr. Brendan Hanley's decision to run for the federal Liberal party shows his ""partisanship"" and raises questions about his decision-making process while working as the territory's top doctor. Hanley took a leave of absence before announcing his candidacy in early August, looking to replace outgoing member of Parliament Larry Bagnell. Yukon Premier Sandy Silver said when Hanley's run was announced that he was confident the territory's management of the COVID-19 pandemic would continue smoothly. Hanley did not return a request for comment on the Yukon Party's allegations. Hanley has been the territory's chief medical officer of health since 2008.

"2021-08-29","Full text: Voters in the West Kootenay can be forgiven for experiencing déjà vu when they look at the ballot before them on Election Day, September 20. That’s because four of the five candidates in the South Okanagan-West Kootenay federal riding, and four of the six in the Kootenay-Columbia riding ran in the last election in October 2019. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the snap federal election on Sunday, August 15, saying Canadians should decide what party will help guide the country out of the pandemic and into economic recovery. Critics say he’s attempting to reestablish a Liberal Party majority, after only gaining 155 seats, a minority government, in 2019. The campaign will be 36 days long – the shortest amount allowed by law. The Valley Voice has given the candidates in both ridings the opportunity to introduce themselves to the area’s voters in this issue. Check out page 10 for the South Okanagan-West Kootenay candidates, pages 18-19 for the Kootenay-Columbia candidates, and pages 20-21 for the North Okanagan-Shuswap candidates.

"2021-08-28","Full text: With the federal election fast approaching, Town & Country News spoke with the candidates in our Grande Prairie – Mackenzie riding (as of press time). Conservative Party of Canada- Chris Warkentin The CPC incumbent Chris Warkentin will seek re-election this September, which will be his sixth federal election. He has served on several committees as an MP and was the Deputy House Leader in 2017. Born in Grande Prairie and raised on a farm near Debolt, Warkentin studied business and marketing at the Grande Prairie Regional College. “The paramount priority for our party, and for myself personally, is to rebuild the local, provincial, and the national economy,” said Warkentin. “The only way to rebuild an individual's finances is to create jobs and to ensure that people have the high paying jobs and the well-paying jobs that will lead to growth and prosperity and opportunity for people throughout the Peace country and throughout the province, and country.” “The government can only spend the money that it brings in, and the government shouldn't be bringing in additional funds by raising taxes at a time that Canadians can least afford to pay an increase in taxes. “We need a government that will actually support the industry that will recognize its importance and will sell the merits of the industry and the product that we produce here in the province of Alberta, around the world because we do know that there is no other country that produces an energy in a way that protects the environment as well as we do, or protects the human rights of those people that work in the industry.” Warkentin said the Conservative party would work with the U.S. to ensure that it comes to Canada for its oil and gas needs before OPEC or any other foreign oil. “An election will provide people with that outlet, that opportunity, to make their voices heard to ensure that Justin Trudeau understands that he is taking the country on a bad track and it's time to, to bring Canada back to a place of a fiscal stability, a place where we see a Conservative government that will advance the interests of places like the Peace country.” Maverick Party- Ambrose Ralph Ambrose Ralph is running for the Maverick party, a party that hopes to bring more Western Canada representation to Ottawa. Ralph, a Grande Prairie resident, is an army veteran and oil gas worker; this is his first time entering the political ring. “I've been a political activist since December 27, 2018,” said Ralph. He ran an oil and gas company with about 100 employees and was told by the vice-president that they would need to cut costs. “In frustration, I sat down and never had any social media at the time, but I did have a LinkedIn account, so I wrote a short letter. I posted it to my LinkedIn account, and it went viral, so a few friends of mine convinced me to take that op-ed and put it in a video,” he said. The video gained about a million views, he said. He then started a political activist platform called ‘Alberta to the point’ where he advocates for Alberta oil and gas, pipelines and how the west is being treated. “We (Maverick party) believe that we have to at least try to get a fair deal within Confederation, we have to try to open up the constitution and get a fair deal for our western citizens. “If that fair deal is not possible within our own country, then the writing is on the wall, and Western Canada has to leave Canada,” said Ralph. “I don't mean that we're giving up on Canada,” he explains, “Canada would have given up on us. “We are preserving those values that we hold so dear about Canada, right here in Alberta. “So we're not necessarily going to leave Canada; we're going to preserve what is left of Canada.” Ralph said he doesn’t think that one or even a group of Maverick MPs going to Ottawa will change the world. If elected, Ralph says, “it will be the first time in the history of Canada that an MP that supports a possible road to sovereignty hasn't been elected in Canada outside the province of Quebec.” Ralph isn’t concerned with splitting the Conservative vote in his riding. “If there was a possibility of a vote split in this area, I would not run. “If there was a possibility that a Liberal would win this riding, I would not run.” Peoples Party of Canada- Shawn McLean Sexsmith area resident Shawn McLean is running for the Peoples Party of Canada. McLean works as an instrumentation technician with a pipeline company, and this is his first foray into politics. “This isn't really an ambition for me,” said McLean but, “when the option presented itself that there is actually a true Conservative option out there, I jumped at the opportunity to be a part of it. “I have pretty strong beliefs on how ineffective politicians have actually been and the game that they seem to play.” “The People's Party of Canada is pretty much about individual freedom, personal responsibility, respect and fairness, and that's really what it comes down to. “We want to have a government that takes care of the country by letting the provinces take care of themselves, and somebody that actually listened to what Canadians want.” McLean explained that the highest priority items for him are “getting pipelines in place, fixing the equalization issues, so it's actually fair for us, giving people choices, making the government smaller and getting the powers back to the provinces so that the provinces can take care of its people.” If elected, the benefits to the South Peace would be “about actually having an active MP going to Ottawa and making the points with the backing of a federal party that can actually represent what it is that people want,” explained McLean. As far as vote-splitting in the riding, McLean is not concerned. “There's no way the Liberals are going to get in power again.” “This is about basically holding our existing government and our existing opposition accountable by saying you know what, our people are fed up, and we're actually going to vote on our principles instead of our fears.” Subject: Provinces; Employment; Pipelines; Political parties"
"2021-08-28","Full text: For over a year, West Nipissing’s council has been one councillor short. They are missing a representative from Ward 7—Verner—since Jeremy Seguin gave his resignation. Normand Roberge was the next runner-up on the voting list and was considered by the municipality for appointment. However, council was unable to decide on how to go about filling the seat. Appointment? Hold a by-election? Accept applications for the seat? Consensus could not be reached, with votes resulting in a 4-4 deadlock. With the process of how to choose a councillor stalled, the possibility of welcoming a new councillor became even more distant. This distance has become a chasm that may only be bridged by the next municipal election in November, 2022. “There’s been no development,” on the councillor front, explained Dan Roveda, who is serving his first term on West Nipissing’s council. He acknowledges “a level of dissatisfaction on how things are going,” adding that “it’s unfortunate that we didn’t have Mr. Roberge” join the team. “He has a wealth of knowledge and he would have brought some stabilization to the table.” Roveda also mentioned that people in the community are asking questions about council’s indecisions regarding a new councillor, “and essentially they are seeing this as not being progressive.” Despite the missing councillor, “things are getting done” Roveda assured. “Administratively, things are getting done,” and municipal staff are “doing a very good job.” “But at the council level, I think the mayor had not provided any leadership,” about the vacant council seat, Roveda said. “Leadership should be gauging what the community wants, and moving forward that way,” he said, adding that “I feel the mayor is failing in her responsibilities, and this is where we’re at, and it’s just created divisiveness around the table.” As for the seat remaining empty, “as far as I’m concerned,” it will. “There’s only a year left now,” he said, “so the polls will rectify that issue in 2022.” Melissa Diakoumeas, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, mentioned that “the decision to fill a vacancy by appointment or by-election is the responsibility of the municipal council.” Municipalities have “the authority to make decisions for matters within their jurisdiction, including deciding on how to fill a vacancy on council,” she added. It appears as if West Nipissing chooses not to choose, but Roveda assures residents that “just because we’re set up in wards,” does not mean councillors are unavailable to help. “I’ve been getting calls from people from Verner, I’ve been advocating for them.” “I don’t think we’re disadvantaging Verner,” he said. “There’s still going to be work done on roads in Verner, and the snow removal will still be done, and if there’s any complaints, they can seek help” from the remaining councillors.

"2021-08-28","Full text: The Lake Report interviewed all the candidates in the Niagara Falls riding for the Sept. 20 federal election. We asked them three identical questions to provide our readers with a sense of the candidates' views and their stance on issues facing Niagara-on-the-Lake. What are the two biggest issues facing Niagara-on-the-Lake this campaign and how will you address them? Tony Baldinelli, incumbent Conservative party With the wine industry a major economic driver in the region, one of Baldinelli’s big concerns for Niagara-on-the-Lake is fighting the escalator clause on excise taxes for alcohol and wine. Excise taxes are applied at the manufacturing level and the wine industry has been exempt from the tax since 2006 so long as they use 100 per cent Canadian grapes. The exemption was the subject of a trade dispute through the World Trade Organization after Australia claimed the exemption was unfair to imported wines. Canada has agreed to end the exemption for wine by June 30, 2022. That means Ontario wines will cost more. The Liberals also applied an escalator clause to the excise tax on alcohol in 2017. That means the excise levy will rise with the cost of inflation every April forever. “We warned the government in 2017 not to implement an escalator clause on the excise tax exemption, which our grape and wine industry had since 2006,” Baldinelli said in an interview Monday. In response, the Liberal government announced over $100 million in financial support for Canadian winemakers over the next two years. “I’m hearing, from both our grape growers and our wineries, that that funding is insufficient for what is needed. They’re still waiting for a permanent replacement program,” Baldinelli said. The federal government said a replacement program to help wineries through the financial changes would be implemented when the exemption ended. The program is to be developed by Agriculture Canada but had not been completed when the election was called, Aaron Dobbin, president and chief executive officer of Wine Growers Ontario, said in an email. Baldinelli said the government's changes will hurt the grape and wine sector. ""How does a (winery) make investments going forward unless they know what that program is going to be and how long the program is going to run? You can't treat businesses like that. So, that's disappointing,"" he said. Support for Niagara’s tourism industry is his second priority. “There’s 40,000 workers in Niagara that rely on the tourism sector. The government committed a billion dollars to a tourism recovery plan,” he said. But that isn’t enough when compared to the amount of money tourism brings to Canada. “Niagara Falls itself generates $2.4 billion. The sector across the country is a $105 billion industry,” he said. Baldinelli said the funding is not available to businesses that really need it. “If you look at the criteria, it excludes restaurants, retail and hotels. So, who is it really for?” Melanie Holm Green party Recovering from the pandemic, particularly in regards to quality of life and tourism, is the most pressing issue for NOTL, says the Green party candidate. “The pandemic has brought attention to our need for better care for seniors, affordable housing options for everyone, expanded mental health supports, and a guaranteed livable income,” Holm said in an email response. She sympathized with the struggles that local tourism has experienced but offered no suggestions for recovery. With Niagara’s ecological importance, the region should become a leader in the fight against climate change, Holm said. “Protecting our wetlands and re-establishing buffer zones around communities and agricultural areas will help protect us locally from the effects of extreme weather and development,” she said. Andrea Kaiser Liberal party “Health is the number one priority. Ending the pandemic through vaccinations is the top priority for every community and that’s no different in Niagara-on-the-Lake,” the Liberal candidate said in an interview. Kaiser said she is against a two-tiered health system after seeing how detrimental lack of health care access is during a pandemic. “I am not in support of any kind of health care system that does not provide access for everybody, including the most vulnerable,” she said. The second most important issue facing NOTL is protecting its heritage districts and tourism industry, she said. “I’d like to work with the municipality to find local solutions on a number of specific items like congestion, heritage and climate action. Congestion in the Old Town and all through Niagara has been a challenge.” Kaiser said she would support the tourism industry in NOTL. “I’ve worked in tourism and hospitality my whole life. I did see first hand what the wage subsidy did to support small businesses,” she said. “I think the continuation of that is absolutely essential, as long as it’s needed.” Brian Barker New Democratic Party Preservation of NOTL's heritage and community character is a critical issue, the NDP's Barker said in an interview. “There are a lot of developers who see golden opportunities in the community,"" but he said what makes Niagara-on-the-Lake special is ""the fact that we’ve been able to maintain its heritage.” “Any ventures that are looking to build or do something in NOTL, I think we have an obligation to the community to maintain and preserve our heritage. I mean, NOTL was the first capital (of Upper Canada).” Barker said climate change also presents a threat to the municipality's agriculture and wine industries. “Unpredictable patterns in the weather will wreak havoc on our wine industry,” he said. “Addressing climate change will be imperative for our future in terms of protecting the different agricultural investments we have here.” Peter Taras People's Party of Canada Infringements on personal freedom are the biggest issue, facing NOTLers, Taras said. “The lockdowns have been a colossal failure, the mask mandate has been a colossal failure. They’ve done absolutely nothing to unite our country. Compared to two years ago, I feel less secure,” Taras said in an interview. He offered the United Nations' worldwide death statistics from the past four years as evidence that masks and lockdowns have not worked. “We should be focusing on hope and courage because fear limits our ability to reason,” he said. The second most important issue for NOTL is reopening the U.S. border, said Taras. “(Border closures) had a massive deleterious effect on Niagara-on-the-Lake with really no backing that there was benefit to it.” Are you and your staff double-vaccinated? Why or why not? How will you approach issues surrounding vaccine mandates and a vaccine passport? Tony Baldinelli The Conservatiive said all leadership positions in his campaign are fully vaccinated but that volunteers either need to be vaccinated or submit to daily COVID rapid testing. He doesn't directly support vaccination mandates but said that rapid testing could be mandated instead. “Canadians have the right to make their own decisions. We firmly believe that rapid testing is needed for the unvaccinated to protect our most vulnerable Canadians,” he said. “We’re going to require federal public servants who aren’t vaccinated to pass a daily rapid test.” Baldinelli said decisions about restrictions against unvaccinated individuals should be left to individual businesses or the province. “(Vaccine passports) are pretty well a provincial issue but businesses have the right to establish rules,” he said. Melanie Holm The Green candidate said she and her staff are double-vaccinated, but she worries about protecting her own children from the spread of the virus. They are both under 12 and unable to receive a COVID vaccine, She understands some people can’t get vaccinated but said, “This isn’t about any one person’s right to choose. This is about the wider community.” “If people have concerns about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines they should be discussing this with their health care providers, not their politicians.” Andrea Kaiser Kaiser said she is double-vaccinated and said she will be asking all of her volunteers and Liberal campaign staff to have two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. “I am supporting mandatory vaccines, as in the workplace here, and I would ask that all other candidates do the same to make sure that we are having a safe election.” “(Vaccination) is the best way to end the pandemic and truly support local businesses because they can’t afford another lockdown.” She said children have needed vaccine records to go to school for many years and noted the concept is not new. Brian Barker The candidate he and all his top campaign workers are double-vaccinated, Barker said. “Not only am I doing it to protect my health and the health of my family, but more importantly, it’s something I’m doing for the community,” he said. As a school teacher, he said he has dealt with immunization records and so-called “vaccine passports” his whole career. Barker has a degree in biotechnology and said he trusts the science behind vaccines. “Vaccination has played an important role in the eradication of many diseases. It’s more than likely that I never contracted polio, measles or diphtheria because of immunizations I was given as a child,” he said. He acknowledged that people can be medically exempt from vaccinations or invoke the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to refuse them but said it was important that people get vaccinated. “We’re all tired of lockdown and vaccination is a tool that will help make sure we can move forward in a positive way.” Peter Taras When it comes to vaccines, Taras is quite straightforward. “I am not vaccinated and I don’t care if my campaign staff are vaccinated or not. If they want to be, that’s fine. If they don’t want to be, that’s also fine,” he said. Vaccine passports and mandates would be “opposed vehemently,"" he said. “I think that bodily autonomy is a right. Our government has violated many Charter rights, so I’m not surprised they violate bodily autonomy as well.” He said he is against any employer creating vaccine mandates for employees and stressed it should be a purely individual decision. What commitments will you make to support Indigenous Peoples living in Niagara? Tony Baldinelli The Conservative said he would defer to Indigenous leaders to target specific issues for Indigenous residents in Niagara. “I look to them for advice and guidance on some of the issues that are of importance and what we can do.” He said he would pursue the mandates of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and continue to provide funding for initiatives such as the Canada Summer Job Program. Melanie Holm The Green party is dedicated to implementing every action in the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirit report, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, she said. “I am listening. Whether elected or not, I will follow the guidance and leadership of the Indigenous community and do whatever is needed to support them in healing the damages done by colonization and genocide.” Andrea Kaiser Kaiser said she would work to continue Liberal programs for affordable housing and financial support. “Historic investments have been made, but there’s so much more work to do – $638 million has been allocated to support Indigenous Peoples living in urban areas outside of reserves,” she said. She touted the Liberal government's $40-billion national housing strategy as a way to boost Indigenous home ownership and stressed that she would work with Indigenous leaders to tackle the problems they deem urgent. “I’m a listener. I’ve been speaking with community leaders in the Indigenous Peoples communities and I’m very committed to continuing the conversation,” Kaiser said. Brian Barker When it comes to working with Indigenous communities in Niagara, Barker is eager but cautious about claiming to know what’s needed. “I’m here to be their biggest ally, but I think we need to bring the communities together and give our friends at the friendship centres the opportunity to share their needs,” said Barker. “As a white man, I’m not going to profess to know the issues of the Indigenous community. We think of them as stakeholders. We need them to sit down and lead the conversation.” Peter Taras The best role for the Canadian government in handling Indigenous issues is to back off, Taras said. “If I was Indigenous affairs minister, my goal would be to make myself redundant in my first term,” he said. He would push to make homeownership easier for Indigenous residents in Niagara and criticized reserves as “socialist” systems where homeownership is impossible. “There’s no reason to have a patronizing Indian Act, which actually only enslaves Indigenous people rather than providing the circumstances for human flourishing,” Taras said.

Health Minister Christine Elliott’s spokeswoman said on Wednesday that Ontario issues proof-of-vaccination receipts to residents after they receive their first and second doses, and that vaccine passports planned by the federal government for international travel could be used by businesses domestically.

"2021-08-28","Full text: Getting Indigenous women and gender-diverse people out to vote in the upcoming federal election is about both the past and the future, says Lynne Groulx. “We've waited for a long time and now I think the timing is right,” said the CEO of the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC). “If we don't do something now then we're leaving it for the next generation to deal with it.” NWAC has kicked off an aggressive campaign aimed at getting out the vote of Indigenous women and gender-diverse people. It's entitled, “We’re done asking, we’re voting”, and has the hashtag #DoneAsking. Groulx points to such reports from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996), the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on the legacy of Indian residential schools (2015), the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) (2019) and “report upon report at the United Nations and what’s really changing? Not that much.” “We should be done asking and we should be voting because we need to influence the results of the election and maybe when we do that then maybe the politicians will ensure that their policies and their legislation really takes us into account,” said Groulx. “We as a group and a collective can actually impact the results.” There is a history of exclusion that Indigenous women and gender-diverse people are battling, both in policies that didn’t allow Indigenous women to vote and colonization that made them a marginalized population, believing their voices weren’t important enough to be heard. This year, Groulx points out, women face more barriers from the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and the “psychological distress” that has come from the uncovering of burial sites on residential school grounds. To help those who have never voted before, NWAC has produced a 23-page voting guide. Written in plain language and detailed, it covers a wide variety of topics from the identification needed to vote; how to register to vote; options for voting; solutions to possible barriers; and how to decide who to vote for. To allow for informed voting, NWAC is doing a comparative chart on the platforms of the five main parties: Liberals, Conservatives, New Democrats (NDP), Greens and Bloc Québécois. NWAC has also sent a questionnaire to the parties for response to their “wish list.” All results will be available on NWAC’s website. The organization is also hosting a “robust social media campaign” which will include daily commentary on news and issues."

"2021-08-28","Full text: In a statement issued on his political party’s Facebook page last week, Chateauguay Mayor Pierre-Paul Routhier announced he would not be seeking re-election when Chateauguay residents go to the polls in November. Citing his advanced age, the soon-to-be-69-year-old lawyer said he would stick to what he told members of his caucus when he first assumed the mantle of leadership in 2017 – namely, that he would be a one-and-done leader – and coupled with his desire to spend more time with his family, he said he would finish out his term to mark the end of his era as a public servant. “I will be 69 years old in a few months and I feel like it’s time to think of myself and my family. As well, in 2017, I informed the members of Vision Chateauguay of my intention to only take one mandate,” he said, and that’s exactly what he’s going to do. Routhier’s announcement comes at a time when the embattled mayor is stuck in the middle of a development controversy stemming from a slated residential development near and adjacent to Kahnawake land at the end of the Old Chateauguay Road. The proposed development is on land that is considered to be a part of the Seigneury of Sault St. Louis Land Greivance and has always been considered Mohawk territory. Members of the Longhouse began occupying the land on July 1 in an effort to ensure community territory would not be encroached upon. Routhier made no mention of the controversy in his announcement, saying only that he enjoyed his time as mayor and getting to know the population through his work in the community. “I got to meet and get to know citizens who were very involved in the community and who made life in Chateauguay very interesting thanks to their involvement and implication in cultural and sports clubs and associations,” he said, adding it was a pleasure to get to know each and every one of them. “It was an honour for me to have worked with you.” Identifier / keyword: Spare News"
"2021-08-28","Full text: While the late August weather has cooled the fire risk in the Kamloops area and helped immensely with evacuation alerts and orders being rescinded, the debate over government resources remains as hot as ever. Amid another devastating wildfire season, Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo candidates in the Sept. 20 federal election are weighing in on how well the federal government has responded with military support. Earlier this month, when the fire were threatening Logan Lake and other communities, Conservative candidate Frank Caputo called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to deploy the Canadian Armed Forces to help fight the fires in B.C., echoing statements from party leader Erin O’Toole, who issued an open letter to the effect last week. ""People are telling me that they need assistance and they need it now,” Caputo said in a release. “After seven weeks of extreme wildfires, the firefighters are burned out and need reinforcements.” In mid-July, the federal government announced up to 350 Canadian Forces personnel were being deployed to B.C. to help. “It should be a full deployment with all hands on deck and all available resources to the area,” Caputo told KTW. “The people who are here are burned out, they need to rejuvenate and, given the nature of the state of emergency we’re in, we appear to need a lot more than 350 people.” Caputo said the military is but one of many resources that could be increased to help fight the fires, noting police and firefighters are already helping and communities are still in jeopardy. “We’re one lightning strike away from catastrophe, so we should be proactive in one sense and giving those other 350 people a break in another.” Liberal candidate Jesse McCormick said the decision is best left to the province and military, which would have determined sending the 350 military personnel to B.C. “The amount of support is based on the provincial authority’s request for assistance,” McCormick said, citing the Canadian Armed Forces public information. According to the federal government’s website, Operation LENTUS is used to determine military response to natural disasters. In the event provincial authorities are overwhelmed by a wildfire season, they can submit a request for assistance outlining how much help they need from the military. From that, the military determines how many people to send, and what kinds of assets to send with them. In recent years, this has been anywhere from 60 to 2,600 members, according to the federal website. On July 20, 350 military personnel were deployed via LENTUS to assist B.C.’s wildfire suppression efforts. Common tasks for each iteration of Operation LENTUS include mopping up fires, evacuating people, checking on residents, helping law enforcement disseminate information and delivering aid to remote communities. McCormick said it’s his understanding the 350 personnel was determined to be the appropriate amount of people to deploy based on the scale of the natural disaster and the request from the province, arguing it is an issue that should not be politicized. “We all stand behind the Canadian Armed Forces, the BC Wildfire Service and their response and tremendous work they’re doing to help keep British Columbians safe,” McCormick said. Meanwhile both local NDP and Green candidates say the military complement in the province is a question best left to the experts and not politicians. NDP candidate Bill Sundhu said that while the question is best left to those overseeing the wildfire situation, the public perception is that more help from added military personnel could be useful. “RCMP forces are stretched, volunteers are stretched, the firefighters themselves and the support crews for the firefighters are stretched as well,” Sundhu said. Green candidate Ian Currie said whatever money is being spent on the upcoming election could be put to better use assisting the wildfire emergency in B.C., but noted the amount of military support needed to help fight wildfires is one for the military and the province to determine. “It’s probably not a question politicians should be answering at this point,” Currie said, opining that it is unfortunate the issue is being politicized. He said it is his understanding the province has asked for more help and that should be provided. “The Canadian military has lots of things to do, but none of them have the same urgency as fighting the forest fires right now,” Currie said. Independent candidate Bob O’Brien said he is not sure how many military personnel should be helping in the firefighting effort, but added they should have been here before the blazes started. “We did not have enough military here,” O’Brien said. He told KTW that from the moment record high temperatures were set in late June and thunderstorms were approaching, a disaster should have been anticipated and military deployed. “I would have been in the premier’s office demanding action and then into the prime minister’s office demanding action — and, if that didn’t provide a proper response, I would have picked up a shovel and asked for volunteers to help put the fires out,” O’Brien said. People’s Party candidate Corally Delwo said she commends the federal government for sending in the troops it did. “We need whatever help we could get,” she said, noting that while the province could probably use more military support, it’s a question of availability, which would need to be examined. Ken Gillis, chair of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District, and some area mayors have also called for more military support to relieve emergency operations volunteers.

"2021-08-28","Full text: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau recently pledged $500 million ahead of the next fire season to train 1,000 new community-based firefighters and fund new equipment — such as water bombers and helicopters — to fight climate change-related events. Here is what Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo candidates have to say. Frank Caputo said his Conservatives plan to invest in technology that can better predict and detect wildfires and pledge to address climate change that directly relates to wildfires. He anticipates party leader Erin O’Toole will have more to announce in the coming days. Caputo noted the Liberals were in power during particularly bad wildfire seasons in 2017 and 2018, arguing their pledge “rings hollow, given they called an election while the province was literally on fire and in a state of emergency.” He also noted Trudeau did not visit areas of B.C. affected by the wildfires. O’Toole has also yet to make a stop. New Democrat Bill Sundhu feels an inquiry will be needed once the wildfire season is over regarding how climate change and wildfires will be managed. He said resources should then be decided upon based on that inquiry. “I think that anybody who makes up policy in the middle of the wildfire [season] is guessing,” Sundhu said, adding that Trudeau’s promises should be taken with some skepticism. “They’ve known about the wildfires and climate change. We had terrible wildfires in British Columbia in 2017, 2018 and now it’s election time and Mr. Trudeau makes all kinds of promises,” he said. Iain Currie said his Greens don’t yet have their platform out with costing, but noted the party has always been clear that there needs to be proactive work managing fire fuels and taking steps on climate change. Corraly Delwo said she hasn’t yet heard of any specific commitments from the People’s Party, but added that, as MP, she would call for a public inquiry to determine how to improve firefighting services given the number of homes and property lost to wildfires this year. According to the BC Wildfire Service, 858,000 hectares of land has been burned by wildfires this year, with only 2018 (1.35-million hectares) and 2017 (1.21-million hectares) resulting in more land scorched by wildfires since record began in 1950.

"2021-08-27","Full text: Earlier this year, the Town of the Blue Mountains (TBM) conducted a public survey to determine the community’s preferred voting method ahead of next year’s municipal election. “The preferred method of voting was electronic voting – being online – followed by vote-by-mail, in-person – being paper ballot – and telephone voting,” said Corrina Giles, town clerk for TBM during a council meeting held on Tuesday. Due to changes to the Municipal Elections Act that were made in 2020, the council is required to pass a bylaw by May 1, 2022 setting the method and manner of voting. Town staff are recommending a “hybrid model” based on the results of a public survey that was held from May 3 to June 1 and received 322 responses. The survey asked for age range, location, and voting preferences. Many of the survey respondents suggested they would prefer the municipality to include online voting due to geographical or accessibility barriers. A question on previous voting habits also indicated that 24.5 per cent of respondents or 79 individuals did not vote in the 2018 election. The 2018 election was the first time TBM used telephone and online voting systems. Previous elections in 2006, 2010 and 2014 were conducted by mail with the use of tabulators. The 2018 election also saw the highest voter turnout of the last four elections at 39.6 per cent. At TBM’s committee of the whole meeting held on Tuesday, council received the survey results and directed that electronic voting – internet and telephone voting – be approved as the voting method for the 2022 Municipal and School Board Election, and direct staff to provide a bylaw to a future meeting of council for enactment. Giles confirmed that the new bylaw will not impede anyone who wishes to vote in person. “Anyone that still wishes to vote in-person, they do have the ability to come to the town hall, to use our devices here, should they require assistance or some people just wish to have the feeling of going to a voting place,” she said. “So this model satisfies that need, as well as the need of those that do not want to come to a voting place, as they may be far away or unable to come to the town hall to vote.” The municipal election is set to take place on Oct. 22, 2022.

"2021-08-27","Full text: ST. MARY’S – The Municipality of the District of St. Mary’s is deploying a new technology that works on traditional telephone lines to help residents stay up-to-the-minute on municipal matters that affect their daily lives. According to CAO Marvin MacDonald, the Voyent Alert Notification system, implemented late last month, is designed for notifications on municipal issues – such as water utility, garbage, taxes, events, cancellations and municipal elections – but it can also be used to keep people informed during crises, such as power outages and storm surges. “Posts on web/Facebook weren’t reaching several customers,” he said. “In this rural area, many residents (especially seniors) don’t have Internet and cell phones or, in some cases, Internet and cell service is unreliable …The Voyent Alert Notification system works on landlines and answering machines so the notification coverage is much wider than the social media platforms alone.” Calgary-based ICEsoft Technologies Canada introduced Voyent in 2018 as an alert system with a “difference.” According to its website, “Voyent … goes beyond the traditional offerings … limited to text notifications and text-to-speech ... and includes personalized information, maps, visuals and attachments. These enriched alerts provide users with relevant information, allowing them to make better, more informed decisions, which helps increase registration and engagement among users.” Earlier this month, the company reported that Voyent is being used by 245 North American municipalities, representing “a serviceable population” of about 1.2 million people, including many affected by wild fires in British Columbia this summer. MacDonald said the Voyent system is intended to complement, not replace, RCMP and provincial emergency systems available in St. Mary’s. Subject: Local elections; Social networks"

"2021-08-27","Full text: Candidates for the upcoming Kneehill County municipal election have announced their intention to run for a seat on council in October, including four incumbent and five new candidates. Of the four incumbent candidates are current Reeve and Deputy Reeve for the county, Division 3 and Division 1 candidates Jerry Wittstock and Faye McGhee respectively, along with Division 6 Councillor Wade Christie, and Division 7 Councillor Kenneth King. Along with the incumbent parties, five new candidates have also been announced-Christopher Morton for Division 2, Carrie Fobes and Rick McInnis for Division 4, and Laura Lee Machell-Cunningham and Robert Park for Division 5. Division 2 candidate Christopher Morton says his decision to run for council began out of frustration regarding the county’s operations and “a personal quest to learn more” which grew into a passion over the last year. “Our councillors and administration are our neighbours and members of our community. I have attempted to be measured in my criticism because, ultimately, I hope to work with both the councillors and administration,” Morton tells the Mail. Morton adds he wants to establish better relations with the municipalities which are part of Kneehill County, and advocate for volunteer organizations-Morton currently serves as a volunteer firefighter with Linden Fire and Rescue and previously with Acme Fire. Laura Lee Machell-Cunningham is running in the municipal election for the first time and is vying for the Division 5 seat alongside fellow candidate Robert Park. Though this will be her first time putting her name on the ballot, Machell-Cunningham has previously worked for the Town of Three Hills and has served on numerous committees over the years. She currently serves as Three Hills Chamber of Commerce Director and is a longtime resident of Kneehill County, having only left the area temporarily to complete her training in social work. “I’m a passionate advocate for people and it’s a mission of mine to help people have their voices heard, issues resolved, and for ratepayers to know their opinions matter,” Machell-Cunningham tells the Mail.

"2021-08-27","Full text: GUYSBOROUGH – Just a little less than two years after the last federal election, held in October 2019, Canadians are heading to the polls again. Given the short time span between elections, it’s interesting to see how the roster of candidates has changed over such a short period of time. One of the new faces voters will see in the riding of Cape Breton-Canso is Glace Bay native Jana Lynn Reddick, whose family has roots in the Lincolnville area of Guysborough County, running for the NDP. As we saw in the recent provincial election, new and younger faces are starting to populate the landscape, and Reddick is one of them. This election is the 29-year-old’s first foray into politics and she’s coming into the campaign looking to affect change and better the lives of constituents in Cape Breton-Canso. Reddick has worked in the social services sector for most of her career as a youth program coordinator, career practitioner and residential counselor. She is pursuing a bachelor’s degree in social work. “When this opportunity came up, I had been working in the field helping people for a really long time. I believed helping one person was enough for me. I figured this might be a way I could help people on a larger scale in a place like Cape Breton-Canso, where I think we’ve needed help for a long time. We were just kind of forgotten about and I feel that is very similar to a lot of clients I’ve had,” said Reddick. She recently received her second diagnosis of breast cancer, but although she has a lot on her plate medically, she told The Journal last week that she wouldn’t let that hold her back from her career, educational and now political goals. If anything, her journey with cancer and the support she received from her community spurred her into the campaign. She notes on her campaign Facebook page: “These past few years have taught me to grab hold of what matters most, and for me, that’s the future of Cape Breton-Canso and everyone in it. Deciding to run in this election with the NDP came directly from the help I received in this wonderful place.”"

"2021-08-27","Full text: GUYSBOROUGH – Over the past two years Mike Kelloway has become a familiar face in northeastern Nova Scotia. Since his election to the federal seat of Cape Breton-Canso in 2019, taking over the reins of the Liberal stronghold from long-time MP Rodger Cuzner, who retired after almost two decades in the position, Kelloway said he has busily traversed the large riding, meeting with constituents to better understand and work to address constituents’ needs. Before entering politics, Kelloway had spent much of his life as an educator, community activist and entrepreneur. He told The Journal in an interview Aug. 20, “I have worked extensively in the not-for-profit community and also with vulnerable groups – First Nations, African Nova Scotians – and basically my approach to life has been focusing on just causes, social causes and economic and social development and community development.” Speaking to the summer election call, Kelloway said, “I am very excited about this election because I think there is a definitive choice between our approach, which I think was indicative during COVID, of having Canadians backs. And we want to double down on that after this election in terms of healthcare, seniors’ care, economic / social development, affordable housing and the environment.” Pandemic recovery In Guysborough County, the seasonal tourism industry has been severely impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting restrictions to travel and limits on capacity for venues and businesses. This newspaper has reported on industry concerns about the unique situations seasonal businesses face and the anxiety caused in anticipating the government’s next move in terms of financial supports. Kelloway said that the federal government recognizes the plight of the tourism industry and vows to maintain support. He added, “I can say that the Guysborough Board of Trade – as it relates to tourism – had a significant impact on our submission on supports during COVID. “This government, and me as an MP, will be focused 100 per cent on doubling down on supports for tourism. They are one of the hardest hit sectors for obvious reasons and we need to have their back. And I’m committed to having their back; this government has committed to having their back. There is no scenario where COVID still exists that we are not supporting the tourism sector in Guysborough County.” Beyond the tourism sector, the pandemic has shown the power of government to do good, Kelloway said, pointing to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS). He said that won’t change but what people will see in the coming months is a focus on being, “Relentless on how we help Canadians now and over the coming years to rebound from [and] recover from COVID – to be innovative, to evolve and grow. And I think something like this opens up a national discussion on guaranteed basic income.” He added, “The Conservatives said, ‘We wouldn’t have done that.’ Well, what would you have done? … I think there are clear distinctions here around a Conservative Party that is clearly right wing and a Liberal Party that is focused on the needs of Canadians. And that’s not dogma, I think we have practised that.” Vaccine passport As the world enters the next phase of COVID-19, where many people in the northern hemisphere have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated, and borders are opening, the question of vaccine passports has become an election issue. Kelloway said, “Personally, what I think we need to do is really fundamentally double down on education around [vaccines] to make sure everyone gets one. And I believe that, when it comes to mandatory testing, I think that you’re going to see businesses that require it as part of their expectations and contracts with workers. “In my personal opinion, we need to study this a little bit more in terms of passports because I want to make sure we’re doing other things right first … It is still a work in progress on that one from a national perspective, but I believe the best thing that we can do is double down … on ensuring that everyone gets their vaccinations which requires more education, more outreach, in terms of what vaccines are and more importantly combating what’s on social media on what they’re not. There is a lot of misinformation. This is why local news is absolutely critical and important because what fills the void is opinion and, quite frankly, false narrative.” Afghanistan After Canadian Forces spent 20-plus years on the ground in Afghanistan, the recent descent into chaos plays on the minds of those who served, and the families of those who served in the region. The riding of Cape Breton-Canso has a proud tradition of military service and sent many community members to Afghanistan. Now constituents and the country question what will happen next. When asked about the upheaval in Afghanistan, Kelloway said in such situations, we always do what we can to help. “We did what we could to ensure that people had the right to education, the right to live their lives as they saw fit and it is a sad moment … We did our best to help people and that should be solace for Armed Forces people who I dearly respect and their families … to help individuals is never for not – it is always for the common good, for social justice; it is always to help people. “The federal government has already said that we will do what we can to get as many people out as we can to come to Canada … What we’ve demonstrated, I think, with our approach to Syria is that when newcomers come to our riding, to our region and to our country they add economic growth, diversity of thought and opinion and hard work and family – and I suspect you’ll see the same thing with Afghanis that come here … Our approach should always be to do whatever we can to ensure safety, security and opportunity for people around the world, including in this case Afghanis … We’ll get as many people out as we can because that is the Canadian way.” Environment The Liberal government’s bona fides on the environment portfolio have been brought into question by actions, such as the purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline, the failure to eliminate fossil fuel industry subsidies and missing the mark on climate accord goals. Kelloway defended the government’s record on the environment, stating, “This government, in the last session of parliament, is strongly focused, through a lot of measures in the budget, on moving away from focusing on industry that’s primary purpose is fossil fuels … the federal government has worked very closely with businesses, in Alberta for example, to make sure that they get off oil and gas to renewables. And some large corporations and businesses are doing that by themselves, but it is not enough. The federal government has to be the lead on all things environmental. “And key investments have been made. We’ve talked about the government buying a pipeline but a huge chunk of those revenues, if the pipeline ever becomes functional, are going back into green technology, green research, green infrastructure … It’s not just an environmental issue, it’s an economic issue, and I would say it is a security issue, it’s a domestic security issue and an international security issue. We see it across the country, this has to be not a nicety…it has to be tangible action taken that is responsible and inclusive of all parties.” Speaking to the divisive Maritime Launch Services Spaceport proposal for Canso, and other major projects in the riding, Kelloway said, “I look at any development, [it] has to meet every federal guideline. It has to pass every smell test every [environmental] protocol that we have [federal and provincial].” Knocking on doors Although it is early days in the federal campaign, Kelloway says there are several key issues that have come to the fore when he speaks to constituents now and over the past two years: funding for healthcare from the federal government to the province, mental healthcare, long-term care; increasing the Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors; affordable and accessible housing; childcare; youth development; and support for small business and not-for-profits."

Schmitt is the running to represent the Maverick Party in the Prince Albert riding in the upcoming federal election on Sept. 20. She says the people she knows who think the same way she does about politics are too busy to run for office. f no one steps up to be a voice, then we have no voice,” she said in an interview in Prince Albert on Aug. 20, having just filed her candidacy papers. The party is only running candidates in Western Canada and has a twin-track approach, she said. “We are looking for constitutional changes for more fairness in the west,” she said. “If we can’t achieve that - or close to - we’ll be pushing for independence.” Schmitt has no background in municipal or provincial politics, but said running a small business has given her some insight. “I’m a small business owner, it affects me every day,” she said. The skills needed to run a small business can translate well into political office, Schmitt said. “There are lots of small challenges in the business world that need to be defeated everyday,” she said, adding that it has given her the ability to go with what is happening and be flexible. “There are a lot of people that are too busy and they can’t do it. So somebody has to,” Schmitt said. After completing her business administration diploma from Lakeland College, Schmitt worked in a few jobs such as accounting, industry and payroll. She then moved back to Carrot River and started working for herself. “That was equine therapy to start with, then I moved into an administration position for organic certification and then I bought some cows and I started an organic beef business,” Schmitt said. “I think it’s time for a Western voice. There has been a lot of controversial issues come up, or promises per se, that benefit the East and should be benefitting the West and it’s not happening. So we’re moving into a position to put our voice into whatever changes are being made to say hey yeah, we’ll vote for it but we need this for the west,” she said. If the voice is not heard, then the party will push for independence. The federal election is September 20. None Subject: Small business; Local elections"

"2021-08-26","Full text: It is election season in Canada once again. On August 15 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he would be calling an election with Election Day set for September 20, 2021. Currently there are only three parties with candidates representing the Cypress Hills-Grasslands riding - current MP Jeremy Patzer, from the Conservative Party of Canada, Val Marie local Alex McPhee representing the NDP and Mark Skagen from the newly formed Maverick Party. There will be more candidates announced as we move towards Election Day. In the last Federal Election Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada won a minority government, given the sudden election only 2 years later. In the Cypress Hills-Grasslands district during the last election, Jeremey Patzer with the Conservative Party of Canada won the race with a majority of 31,140 votes. In second place was Trevor Peterson of the NDP with 3,666 votes and in third place was the Liberal Party of Canada with William Caton with 1,595 votes. Trailing behind in fourth was newcomer Lee Harding of the People’s Party of Canada. This election will be interesting for Canadian voters because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Delta Variant, which will be big topics in this election, particularly the idea of vaccine passports and support for those who lost jobs or business due to the pandemic, along with other topics including the economy, environment, health care, and truth and reconciliation. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal party won the most seats in the 2019 Election and formed a minority government by winning 157 ridings. The Liberals might have the hardest time this time around, being the party that led Canadians through the pandemic from the start. So, voters will have to decide if they did a good job handling the pandemic. The Conservatives also have a new leader, Erin O’Toole, who replaced former leader Andrew Scheer after failing to beat the Liberals in the 2019 election and winning 121 seats. Voters will see if leadership was the main issue with the Conservatives last election. Meanwhile the NDP and their leader Jagmeet Singh are in an interesting position. Only winning 24 seats, sitting behind the Bloc Quebecois, they helped keep the minority government in power while also pushing the Liberals for more benefits for business and people struggling during the pandemic. All parties have been critical of Trudeau on his handling of the pandemic and calling an early election. Election Day is set for Sept. 20, 2021, with advance voting starting on Sept. 10-13.

"2021-08-26","Full text: Manitoba premier hints at early departure WINNIPEG - Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister left the door open Tuesday to retiring before his successor is chosen while the list of potential new leaders shrunk. Pallister was repeatedly asked in a news conference whether he would commit to staying on until a leadership vote Oct. 30. The date was set Monday night by the Progressive Conservative party executive. He declined to commit. ""I'll continue to do the best I can ... I'll just give it all I've got as long as I can, and when I decide to leave, I'll let you know,"" Pallister said. ""It's not an easy decision."" Pallister announced earlier this month that he would not seek re-election and asked the party to start planning a leadership vote. The party has set the voting date, a deadline of Sept. 15 for candidates who want to join the race and a $25,000 entry fee. The only person who has declared an intention to run is former health minister Heather Stefanson, who stepped down from her cabinet portfolio to initiate her leadership bid. Two high-profile Tories who had said they were considering a run — Finance Minister Scott Fielding and Families Minister Rochelle Squires — said Tuesday they had decided to bow out. ""After much discussion with my family ... I really came to the decision that it's not the time for me to make such a commitment,"" said Squires, who added that she has not yet decided whether to back another candidate. Fielding said he will support Stefanson, who already has the backing of most Tory caucus members. ""I do think that she's the right person at the right time to lead the province,"" Fielding said. Two other people who have said they were considering a leadership run — Winnipeg city councillor Scott Gillingham and former member of Parliament Shelly Glover — have yet to announce a decision. If Pallister leaves before the party leadership vote, an interim leader can be chosen to take over the premier's role. The timing of the leadership transfer has thrown into question the planned fall sitting of the legislature. Five bills criticized by the Opposition New Democrats, including a major education overhaul, are to be debated and voted on in a sitting scheduled to start Oct. 6. Stefanson has promised to kill the education bill, which proposes to eliminate elected school boards and centralize education decision-making. Pallister has said he will leave the legislative agenda to his successor. The NDP on Tuesday urged the government to reconvene the legislature and withdraw all five bills. ""It allows (the Tories) to have a clean slate, to start with a new leader,"" NDP house leader Nahanni Fontaine said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 24, 2021.

ALBANY, N.Y. _ Kathy Hochul became the first female governor of New York in a brief, private ceremony at the stroke of midnight Tuesday, taking control of a state government desperate to get back to business after months of distractions over sexual harassment allegations against Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo left office at 12:00 a.m, two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle. He submitted his resignation letter late Monday to the leaders of the state Assembly and Senate. On his final day in office, Cuomo released a pre-recorded farewell address in which he defended his record over a decade as New York's governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a ""media frenzy.'' Hochul was scheduled to have a ceremonial swearing-in event Tuesday morning at the Capitol, with more pomp than the brief, legally required event during the night. For the first time, a majority of the most powerful figures in New York state government will be women, including state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Attorney General Letitia James and the chief judge, DiFiore. The state Assembly is led by a man, Speaker Carl Heastie. Cuomo's resignation comes after an independent investigation overseen by state Attorney General Letitia James concluded there was credible evidence he'd sexually harassed at least 11 women. Hochul, who said she didn't work closely with Cuomo and wasn't aware of the harassment allegations before they became public, has vowed no one will ever call her workplace ""toxic,"" saying she has a different approach to governing. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... WASHINGTON — The leaders of the world’s seven major industrialized democracies met on what was a happy occasion at on England’s southeast coast two months ago, which included the welcomed appearance of President Joe Biden and his “America is back” message. On Tuesday, leaders of the Group of Seven nations will meet again in virtual format confronted by a resurgence in the COVID-19 pandemic, more dire news on climate change and the burgeoning refugee crisis in Afghanistan following the collapse of its government and fears of a resurgence in Afghan-based terrorism. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reconvening the leaders for crisis talks on Afghanistan amid widespread unhappiness about Biden’s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Complaints have come from Britain, France, Germany and others in the G-7, which includes only one non-NATO member, Japan. Despite Biden’s April announcement that the U.S. would completely withdraw from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the central Asian nation was almost an afterthought when the G-7 met in June in the English resort town of Cornwall. Johnson and others, including French President Emmanuel Macron. are pushing Biden to extend his self-imposed Aug. 31 deadline for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces in order to ensure the evacuation of all foreign nationals as well as Afghans who worked for or otherwise supported the American-led NATO operation that vanquished the Taliban in 2001 and has now accepted defeat. --- On this day in 1990 ... Three Canadian warships set sail for the Persian Gulf to participate in the blockade of Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait three weeks before. --- In entertainment ... LONDON — A British judge has ruled that songs by punk trailblazers the Sex Pistols can be used in a forthcoming TV series despite the opposition of former frontman John Lydon. Ex-Pistols guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook sued the singer, once known as Johnny Rotten, after he tried to block the music’s use in “Pistol,” which is being made for Disney subsidiary FX and is based on a memoir by Jones. Lydon called the show “nonsense” during hearings last month at the High Court and said the songs could not be licensed without his consent. But Cook and Jones claimed that an agreement dating from 1998 allowed a majority decision. High Court judge Anthony Mann agreed, saying the pair were entitled to invoke “majority voting rules” as outlined in the band agreement. He said Lydon’s claim that he was not aware of the details or implications of the agreement that he had signed was “a convenient contrivance.” “Pistol” is being directed by Danny Boyle, the Academy Award-winning director of “Trainspotting” and “Slumdog Millionaire.” Formed in London in 1975, the Sex Pistols split up in 1978 and Bassist Sid Vicious died the following year. The surviving members have reunited for several concerts, most recently in 2008. --- ICYMI ... HALIFAX — An anti-racism advocate says a recent Nova Scotia Court of Appeal decision on sentencing for Black offenders will help the justice system recognize the full extent of the injustices facing African Nova Scotians. The ruling, which requires trial judges during sentencing to consider the historical disadvantages and systemic racism experienced by Black offenders, is ""a turning of the tides,"" said Robert Wright, executive director for the African Nova Scotian Decade for People of African Descent Coalition. ""We recognize now that justice is not blind,"" he said in an interview. ""It has been too sighted in the wrong way and that justice is meted out kind of proportionally to your status in the society."" Justice Anne S. Derrick, on behalf of a Court of Appeal panel, ruled that compelling judges to inquire about the systemic issues facing African Nova Scotians could help reduce the levels of incarceration in that community. ""This is not a conventional appeal,"" Derrick wrote in the 5-0 ruling. ""We are not being asked to find the sentencing judge erred in law or imposed a manifestly unfit sentence. ""The moral culpability of an African Nova Scotian offender has to be assessed in the context of historic factors and systemic racism, as was done in this case."" The decision involved the case of Rakeem Rayshon Anderson, an African Nova Scotian man who was found guilty on five firearm-related charges in June 2019. Police had found a .22-calibre revolver in his waistband following a traffic stop in November 2018. Provincial court Chief Judge Pamela Williams handed Anderson a conditional sentence of two years less a day, along with two years' probation. She said her sentencing decision was supported by the results of an Impact of Race and Culture Assessment involving Anderson. Williams said regardless of the sentence she imposed, it would likely ""do little to deter others in similar circumstances"" because of socio-economic forces that are ""firmly entrenched in systemic racism and marginalization."" The Crown said it didn't appeal the decision to overturn the sentence, but it wanted guidance on the lower court judge's ruling. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 24, 2021 Subject: Invasions; Racism; Sexual harassment; Criminal sentences; Leadership; Election results; Court hearings & proceedings; State elections; Governors; Military withdrawals; Race; Public hearings; Firearms; COVID-19"

"2021-09-21","Full text: The federal NDP candidates for the Sudbury and Nickel Belt ridings celebrated their official campaign launch on Sunday ahead for the Sept. 20 federal election. Sudbury’s NDP candidate Nadia Verrelli joined Nickel Belt NDP candidate Andréane Chénier for a barbecue at the party’s official headquarters located at 1486 Lasalle Blvd. Ahead of the celebration, both candidates teamed up to announce the NDP’s plan to make rent more affordable in Sudbury. The party said it will tighten the rules to prevent big developers from ‘renovicting’ families, make it easier for families to pay rent by providing up to $5,000 per year in financial assistance, and tackle waitlists for affordable housing. “Instead of helping people who lost their jobs during this pandemic, (Liberal leader) Justin Trudeau threatened to stop the CERB that was helping Sudburians pay their rent,” said Verrelli. “We are also seeing rents go through the roof as developers are hiking the rents. Instead of helping families in Sudbury, Trudeau has sided with rich developers. He’s no friend of tenants and their families who are trying everything they can to make ends meet.” People in Sudbury are paying $2,232 more a year in rent for a two-bedroom apartment, the NDP said in a release. “That’s almost a 20 per cent increase in just six years. Justin Trudeau refuses to close loopholes used by wealthy developers to raise prices out of control,” said the press release. Canada’s NDP leader Jagmeet Singh says he wants to ensure that the ultra-rich pay their share and rents stay affordable for everyday families. “What kind of economic recovery can people look forward to if their rents are sky-high?” said Chénier in the release. “Families paying the rent can’t afford four more years of Justin Trudeau. We need to do better. New Democrats will help families make it through this pandemic towards a just recovery.” This announcement builds on a previous pledge to build 500,000 affordable homes within 10 years. “The NDP’s plan for affordable homes will get big money out of Canada’s housing market and help young families buy a home they can afford,” the NDP said. “The NDP would go after big money investors by putting a 20 per cent Foreign Buyer’s tax on the sale of homes to the individual who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents.” The party said its plan would target money laundering and organized crime within the housing sector by making it harder to hide behind nameless companies and giving regulators more teeth, said the press release. The NDP also wants to lift GST on building homes that meet affordability standards and to create a fund to help non-profits, not big developers, buy properties to help keep communities affordable. “Young people in our region who want to buy a home in Sudbury are being priced out because of a runaway housing market,” said Chénier. “Justin Trudeau had six years to do something for young families who can’t afford their own home in our community, but he chose to do nothing. Trudeau sided with big corporations and big money investors who are inflating the price of homes. That’s not fair to young families here.” The Canadian Real Estate Association reported that the average price for a home in Greater Sudbury increased 33.8 per cent from February 2020 to February 2021. “In Sudbury, young people are facing the highest housing prices in Northern Ontario combined with (fewer) opportunities caused by the massive cuts at Laurentian under the Trudeau Liberals. The city is also facing a homelessness crisis. We can’t afford continued inaction by Justin Trudeau,” said Verrelli. ""New Democrats will help young people afford their homes right here in Sudbury and we will tackle the housing crisis.""

"2021-08-26","Full text: Manitoba Tories to pick new leader in October WINNIPEG - Manitoba's governing Progressive Conservatives will choose a new party leader and premier Oct. 30. The party executive met Monday night and also set down rules, including an entry fee of $25,000. Premier Brian Pallister announced earlier this month he would not seek re-election, and said Monday he is prepared to step aside within a few weeks. Pallister also said the future of his planned education reforms and other bills still before the legislature will be decided by his successor, not by him. The only person so far who has announced a plan to run for leader is former health minister Heather Stefanson, who has garnered the support of most Tory caucus members. She has promised to scrap the education reform bill, which would eliminate elected school boards and has faced strong criticism across the province. Stefanson and any other potential leadership candidates face several requirements, such as having to sell a minimum of 1,000 new or renewed party memberships. The cutoff for signing up supporters as members is Sept. 30. The Sept. 15 deadline to enter the race is five days before the federal election, which will be a barrier to any federal candidate that might consider a provincial leadership run as a backup. Royce Koop, who teaches political studies at the University of Manitoba, said the rules seem to help Stefanson's potential bid. ""With the tight timeline, it will be easier for Stefanson, given her strong advantage in caucus,"" Koop said Monday. ""She can rely on those (constituency) organizations throughout the province to deliver members' votes."" Paul Thomas, professor emeritus at the university, also said Stefanson has an advantage. ""This makes it hard for any candidate starting from behind, especially a candidate who is not elected or not a well-known public figure."" The timing of the leadership race raises questions about how the Tories will manage the fall sitting of the legislature that starts Oct. 6. Votes and public hearings on the education reform bill and other proposed laws are scheduled for October and early November. One bill aims to crack down on blockades of roads, rail lines and other infrastructure. Another would temporarily halt public regulatory hearings on electricity rates and allow the government to set rates unilaterally. A third would remove the automatic right to binding arbitration in labour disputes.

""Registrants will be notified of the cancellation,"" Cunningham wrote.

""I have 0 tolerance for anyone who promotes fear, hate, racism, etc."" But Chamber CEO David Duplisea defended Bernier’s inclusion. “Whether you love him or hate him, he is part of the national landscape,” Duplisea told the newspaper. “There are People’s Party of Canada candidates running. There is one right in Saint John. You’re going to hear about it. (The party) is part of it.” In the 2019 federal election, the People’s Party ran 315 candidates in its inaugural campaign.

"2021-08-26","Full text: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau was in Halifax on Monday promising $6 billion in new health-care spending if re-elected to be used to hire thousands of doctors and reduce wait times. Trudeau’s health-care announcement comes in the wake of Nova Scotia’s recent election that saw the Progressive Conservatives topple the incumbent Liberal government by betting big on health care. Aware of this, Trudeau was quick to use the promise of expanded health-care funding to draw a distinction between himself and Erin O’Toole’s Conservative Party. “We’ve transferred billions of dollars over the last few months to the provinces in order to help with the pandemic, and I fully agree with provinces that we have to increase health transfers,” Trudeau said. The $6 billion will be used “to reduce the backlog that has accumulated both during this pandemic and was already accumulating before,” he said. The Liberals are promising the money would also be used to expand virtual health care, and promote health professionals going to remote and rural areas by forgiving more student loans. Right now, there are nearly five million Canadians without a family doctor, and 3.2 per cent of Canadians were waiting for treatment in 2020, the Liberals say. Of the money promised Monday, $3.2 billion over four years would be used to hire 7,500 doctors, nurses, and nurse practitioners. Over that same period, the Liberals are also promising $400 million more for virtual care. The Liberal Party also says additional money could be available for digital infrastructure, and that the added virtual care funding is in addition to the approximate $240 million Ottawa announced during the pandemic. “This announcement doubles down on the Liberal Party’s commitment to public universal health care at the same time we’ve seen Erin O’Toole double down on his belief in the private for-profit system,” Trudeau said. The NDP, meanwhile, is criticizing the Liberals for recycling an old promise, given that a $6-billion commitment for health spending is included in the Liberal’s 2019 platform. “Justin Trudeau says the right thing about access to doctors, but his record shows that he has no intention of following through,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said in a statement. “People who don’t have access to doctors can’t afford Justin Trudeau’s empty promises anymore.” In 2019, the Liberal Party promised, if elected, it would ensure every Canadian would have access to a family doctor, mental health services, and that it would implement a universal pharmacare program. Ahead of the 2019 election, Trudeau’s government acknowledged Canada is the only country in the world that provides universal health care, but not universal coverage for prescription drugs. Before that election, a report was drafted by Health Canada recommending principles to guide a national pharmacare plan, create a new drug agency, and develop a national strategy for expensive drugs for rare diseases, among others. The Conservative Party did not immediately return a request for comment. Subject: Health care; Pandemics; Political parties"
"2021-11-18","Full text: Health care, climate, workers dominate trail OTTAWA - As the federal election campaign entered its second full week, the Liberals painted themselves as the trusted guardians of universal health care and the New Democrats promised to be true environmental stewards by ending fossil fuel subsidies. While Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and the NDP's Jagmeet Singh played to traditional strengths, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole took a somewhat unexpected turn with an appeal to average workers buffeted by pandemic turmoil. In Halifax, Trudeau said Monday the Liberals would spend $3 billion over four years starting in 2022 to hire 7,500 family doctors, as well as tax and student loan incentives for health professionals who open offices in rural or remote communities. He also pledged an extra $6 billion to help reduce wait times. ""This is our moment to rebuild a health-care system that works for all Canadians and that our kids can be proud to inherit,"" Trudeau said. Working closely with the provinces during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Liberals have heard their calls for the federal government to provide more funding to ensure people get better care, he said. ""So that's exactly what we're going to do. Wait lists have grown and grown, and not just because of COVID-19. We're going to eliminate the backlog that has been building for years and reduce wait times for you and your family."" However, Trudeau found himself on the defensive after a tweet from his deputy prime minister attempting to portray O'Toole as a supporter of private health care was labelled ""manipulated media."" Twitter flagged the tweet from Chrystia Freeland, who is seeking re-election in Toronto, after she posted spliced-together clips of O'Toole answering a question about private, for-profit options in universal health coverage. O'Toole said in the video from the Conservative leadership race that he wanted to find public-private synergies. In Ottawa, O’Toole reiterated his support for a universal public health-care system without saying what he thinks could be improved through privatization. The Conservative leader pointed to his election promise to inject an additional $60 billion into provincial health transfers. But when asked to specify what services or areas he believes could benefit from privatization he didn’t directly answer. Singh accused the Liberals of foot-dragging on the move to renewable energy sources. He said in Montreal that immediately ending the flow of federal funds to fossil fuel enterprises is ""exactly what we need to do"" to fight climate change. The NDP leader committed to reallocating subsidies to oil and gas companies toward the clean, renewable energy sector, as well as cutting Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by more than half by the year 2030 with projects such as electrified public transit. O'Toole said a Tory government would require federally regulated employers such as banks and railways with over 1,000 employees or $100 million in annual revenue to include worker representation on their boards of directors. In a bid to attract votes from card-carrying union members, the Conservatives said too many decisions at major corporations are being made without the people who helped build the company at the table. There's an opportunity to ensure Canadian workers go back to better jobs following the pandemic, the party said. Singh quickly retorted that O'Toole's record shows he is no friend of Canadian workers, alleging he had sided with Trudeau on shielding the ultrarich at the expense of others. Bloc Québécois Yves-François Blanchet proposed several reforms aimed at bolstering integrity in federal politics, including giving the ethics commissioner broader powers and making the process for appointing judges more impartial.

"2021-09-03","Full text: The Village of Morrin says a social media page slamming the former mayor of the tiny municipality doesn’t belong to them. The revelation was made at the regular council meeting in the village office Aug. 18. Former mayor Howard Helton appeared as a delegation to the council meeting with several questions for the village about a Facebook page named “Morrin – Village of Morrin, Alberta” that printed statements encouraging people to enter the upcoming municipal election to ensure Helton, who is a registered candidate for the 2021 election, doesn’t win a seat at the council table. Helton stated he was concerned about “...some of the content” on that Facebook page, including posts dated Apr. 16 and July 24 which he provided to the village. The posts were also provided to the ECA Review. Helton also referred to the July 24 post. Helton, who confirmed the “husband and wife” referred to him and his spouse, told Official Administrator (OA) Harold Johnsrude that he had a number of questions about this Facebook page, including is that page under the Village of Morrin’s control, do those two posts represent the village’s official position on Helton and his wife’s candidacy, who wrote those two posts and who is responsible for posting on that page? Johnsrude stated the village does not use Facebook and doesn’t have a Facebook page so couldn’t comment on any of the questions. Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Annette Plachner also said, “We don’t have Facebook.” Helton stated he couldn’t find any person’s name associated with the Facebook page and added it looked like the page was created in 2011. Village staff during the council meeting found the Facebook page in question and noted there were posts dating back at least several years with photos of the village. Helton suggested the village look into the situation as a Facebook page that appears to represent the village but is controlled by an unknown person could put the village in a bad light. The Facebook page in question was located Aug. 19 by the ECA Review and while no individual’s name was visible, a phone number was displayed along with a link to the Morrin library’s website. A classification of the page states “government and public service” along with “government organization.” Readers should note that a Municipal Affairs candidate guide for the upcoming municipal election is available on the provincial government’s website and many municipal sites that includes rules from the Local Authorities Election Act and Municipal Government Act including the prime eligibility requirement to run in the election: “To become a municipal candidate you must be at least 18 years of age on nomination day, a Canadian citizen, and you must have been a resident of the local jurisdiction for the six consecutive months immediately preceding Nomination Day.”"

The Halifax Examiner is working on a reporting series about the housing crisis in Nova Scotia, and is visiting communities to hear your stories, ideas, angles, and issues you want us to cover. Suzanne Rent will be hosting this Thursday’s session along with myself. Guests must wear masks and seating will be spaced out for COVID-19 protocols. There is limited seating for this meeting, so please register early at this link. (link to this item) Speaking of the housing crisis, last week the Examiner’s Zane Woodford reported that: This took place the day after Tuesday’s election and culminated at the former Halifax Memorial Library site in a chaotic scene that lasted several hours and saw multiple people arrested. Multiple protestors and onlookers alike were pepper-sprayed by police, including a 10-year-old girl. In a press conference the next day, Halifax Regional Police Chief Dan Kinsella defended the force’s actions saying they “responded appropriately” in what Halifax Examiner editor Tim Bousquet described as an attempt at “gaslightling.” At one housing encampment that remains in central Halifax, organizers have mobilized to help with things like keeping watch on the safety of those housed in the park, to work as liaisons to address noise complaints by the area’s residents, and to help clean up garbage in the neighbourhood as to not have any of it wrongly attributed to the encampment. A series of community discussions and information sessions took place on Sunday at the encampment. In between sessions, just before 4pm, it was announced to a round of applause that a donation of soup had been made for those living in the encampment, as well as the few dozen people on site attending the sessions and lending support. Leah Buffett runs the Montessori House of Learning where she teaches children the importance of life skills, the environment, and social justice issues such as homelessness. She accompanied students from her program, including her two children, as they were the ones to physically deliver the food that they helped prepare for the homeless — something she said she made a point to have them do. Tari Ajadi hosted one of the sessions Sunday. Originally from Nigeria, he is a permanent resident by way of England. He lives in the neighbourhood and he attended the protest of the removal at the former library on Wednesday. Ajadi is a member of the Nova Scotia Police and Policy Working Group. When speaking on the name where the encampment is located (Nick Meagher Community Park) he said there is a sad irony that ties in with Halifax’s dark history. Ajadi said: “The guy who this place was initially named for, Meagher, was deputy mayor when Africville happened and sanctioned it. So in other words … this space in some ways is part of the legacy of racism in this city, just as the old central library is. So as a Black person, you know, I’m not African Nova Scotian, but I believe that it’s my role and duty as someone who’s coming here to try to help pick up in the lineage of organizing that’s existed here for hundreds of years.” Ajadi is also on the board of the Health Association of African Canadians and is a part of The African Nova Scotian Decade for People of African Descent Coalition (DPAD). “I’m involved with everything but … I’m here because I saw what was happening and I think that when council evicts folks out of spaces, it’s a message as much as it is an explicit policy choice. It’s a message about who is and isn’t welcome, and we know what comes next with that.” “The thing that comes next with that is that then they find the Black folks that are vulnerable.” (link to this item) Nova Scotia’s 41st election on Tuesday, August 17 saw Tim Houston’s Progressive Conservatives win a majority government. The election also saw a record total of four candidates of African descent elected to the legislature: two-time Liberal incumbent Tony Ince; Liberal newcomers Angela Simmonds and Ali Duale; and NDP newcomer Suzy Hansen."
"2021-08-25","Full text: For as long as elections have been held in Callander, the paper ballot was cast in-person, at polling stations within the region. Times might be changing, as council is considering adopting a mail-in ballot for the 2022 municipal election. The idea remains in the preliminary stage, with council directing staff to create an in-depth report on the option, which will then return for council’s consideration. If mail-in ballots are adopted, the town will still operate a voting station on the day of the election. However, there will be no advance polls. The mail-in ballot will do away with those. Callander’s municipal clerk, Elaine Gunnell, provided a report to council in preparation for their August 17 meeting. She noted that mail-in voting “is generally considered a cost-effective method” for conducting an election “in a municipality the size of Callander.” Eliminating advance polls, mailing voter notification cards, and hiring and training fewer election workers will save the municipality money, her report outlines. Moreover, the argument can be made that mail-in ballots provide more “convenience for electors,” and greatly improves accessibility. “Even though care is taken to meet accessibility requirements at voting places,” Gunnell explained, “persons with various kinds of disabilities may find it easier” to mail in their ballot. According to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, “alternate voting methods” such as mail-in ballots “help to improve voter turnout.” In Callander’s 2018 election, voter turnout was a hair over 30 per cent, so any help would be appreciated. Covid concerns will also factor into their decision on whether to adopt mail-in voting, as “uncertainty” remains, and gathering restrictions over the past year and a half highlighted the need to be prepared for the unexpected. Internet voting is not on the table, as mail-in “is a more suitable alternative for Callander,” as it eliminates “connectivity issues, particularly in the rural areas,” whereas Canada Post reaches all residents.

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 23 ... What we are watching in Canada ... UNDATED—The main federal party leaders are in central and eastern Canada as the election campaign enters its second full week. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau remains on the East Coast today, making an announcement in Halifax before heading to St. John's, N.L., to meet with locals and supporters. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, meanwhile, returns to the Ottawa hotel where he spent the first several days of the campaign. He's set to make an announcement in the morning, followed by two of the ""virtual telephone town halls"" that have become a hallmark of his election outreach later in the day. O'Toole has faced criticism from his opponents for spending so much time on the fourth floor of the Westin, but he says he's simply a pandemic-era leader making safety-driven decisions. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh plans to make an announcement about climate change in Montreal, where he launched his campaign and is trying to win back seats from the Liberals and Bloc Quebecois. --- Also this ... UNDATED — Canada’s municipal leaders are asking federal parties to not only build new affordable rental units, but pledge to protect ones on the verge of disappearing. As an election campaign plays out across the country, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities is seeking money to help cities and housing providers buy low-rent units that could fetch a far higher price. Often, that is done through the process of “renoviction” where a landlord removes a tenant, makes upgrades and then lists the unit at a higher price. The issue is one of several the federation has put forward for parties to consider as part of billions in hoped-for spending to expand affordable housing options. Federation president Joanne Vanderheyden says there is a particular need to expand and protect rental options as the price of housing skyrockets across Canadian municipalities. She says local leaders are looking for promises to help preserve and expand market and non-market rental options. With every party prioritizing affordable housing on the campaign trail, Vanderheyden and her municipal counterparts are optimistic that they can get most, if not all, of what they’re asking for as they see residents of their cities getting priced out of the market. “There's nothing worse than answering the phone and having someone weeping on the other line being evicted and not having any place to go,” said Vanderheyden, mayor of the Municipality of Strathroy-Caradoc, just west of London, Ont. “People need a place to live. Everyone needs a safe, affordable place to live. So this is the problem, that's the base of the problem. So how do we get there?” For the federation, the path starts with $585 million to launch a program to buy low-rent market housing in a bid to spare it from “renoviction” or being converted into higher-priced units. --- And this ... UNDATED — Cooler conditions have helped firefighters make some progress against the White Rock Lake wildfire in British Columbia's Interior. The Central Okanagan Emergency Operations says although conditions improved over the past two days, firefighters still have their hands full battling the blaze. Cooler temperatures, calmer winds and some light rain have allowed officials to downgrade several evacuation orders across the province, but the agency says conditions remain ""very dry"" near Kelowna, B.C. Alex Van Bruksvoort, the fire chief for North Westside Fire Rescue, says he and the service know residents want to return home but are asking them to wait until conditions are safer. The BC Wildfire Service says about 250 blazes are still burning across the province. The Ministry of Forests says nearly 8,600 square kilometres have been burned by wildfires since the start of the fire season, and there are more than 3,600 firefighters battling blazes across the province. The evacuation order for more than 1,300 properties and alert for 850 properties remains in place for those affected by the White Rock Lake fire. Meanwhile, the Mount Law wildfire, also in the Interior, continues to burn out of control. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... WESTERLY, R.I. — The tropical depression Henri appears to be lingering in the Northeast, raising the prospect it will bring sustained rains and cause major flooding inland. The National Weather Service says the system is expected to stall Monday near the Connecticut-New York state line before moving east across New England. The agency warned Henri could produce 5 to 15 centimetres of total rainfall over much of the Northeast, leading to flash flooding. Henri was a hurricane at one point before it made landfall in Rhode Island. It was downgraded to a tropical storm and is now a depression. --- Also this ... WAVERLY, Tenn. — A sheriff in Tennessee says at least 22 people are dead any many are missing after record-setting rain caused devastating flooding that swept away homes. A Facebook page from officials in Waverly listed about 40 missing people Sunday afternoon. Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said many of the missing were from neighborhoods hit hardest by Saturday’s flash flood. The dead ranged in age from young children to elderly people and included the foreman at country star Loretta Lynn's ranch. Up to 17 inches of rain fell in less than 24 hours, which set a new one-day record for rainfall in Tennessee. --- And this ... SINGAPORE — Vice President Kamala Harris says the U.S. must maintain its focus on evacuating Americans and vulnerable Afghans and shouldn’t get distracted by questions over what went wrong in the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan. Harris made the comment at a news conference in Singapore after meeting with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to discuss issues ranging from the coronavirus response to cybersecurity. But the news conference was dominated by Afghanistan, after the messy U.S. withdrawal sparked concerns about America’s commitments to its allies globally. Harris’ visit to Singapore and Vietnam this week is seen as the first real test of the Biden administration’s ability to reassure key allies of its resolve. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... KABUL — The German military says a firefight at one of the gates of Kabul’s international airport killed at least one Afghan soldier. The shooting early today was the latest chaos to engulf Western efforts to evacuate those fleeing the Taliban takeover of the country.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Don Everly, one-half of the pioneering Everly Brothers whose harmonizing country rock hits impacted a generation of rock ‘n’ roll music, has died. He was 84. A family spokesperson said Everly died at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday. His brother, Phil Everly, died in January 2014 at age 74. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the duo of Don and Phil drew upon their rural roots with their strummed guitars and high, yearning harmonies, while their poignant songs embodied teenage restlessness and energy. Their 19 top 40 hits included “Bye Bye Love,” “Let It Be Me,” “All I Have to Do Is Dream” and “Wake Up Little Susie,” and performers from the Beatles to Simon & Garfunkel cited them as key influences. The two broke up amid quarreling in 1973 after 16 years of hits, then reunited in 1983, “sealing it with a hug,” Phil Everly said. Although their number of hit records declined in the late 1980s, they had successful concert tours in the U.S. and Europe. They were inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, the same year they had a hit pop-country record, “Born Yesterday.” Two years earlier, they had success with the up-tempo ballad “On the Wings of a Nightingale,” written by Paul McCartney. Don Everly said in a 1986 Associated Press interview that he and his brother were successful because “we never followed trends. We did what we liked and followed our instincts.” --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 23, 2021 Subject: Firefighters; Local elections; Airports; Floods; Evacuations & rescues; Weather; Press conferences; Forest & brush fires; Affordable housing; Prime ministers; Rain"

Before the by-election opportunity, Kusch said that he had already decided to run in the next election. “I spoke with my wife, and we decided to try it out and see what happens. I put my name in, and then everything went fast from there.” Kusch was acclimated since he was the only one to put their name forward. “I figured I would put my name in and then learn from the election and get information for next time, but I didn’t expect to get in that quick.” As an outsider looking in, Kusch said it’s easy to criticize things, and he wanted to see how things run on the inside. Getting right to work, learning the ropes and finding his footing, Kusch said he recognized that people think councillors have “infinite power” over things. “It sometimes feels like people think you can get stuff done or send somebody somewhere or get people to go do a job. You are more of a voice, one of seven, and you don’t have much say or pull on your own. It’s not that you can’t try and help people, but you’re reaching out to the administration and trying to get the help that way.” In just under two years, Kusch said that so much change has already happened and that he is looking forward to where things go from here. “A lot of it, I think, is for the better, if you look at the financial position, where the county is at right now and to where they were before. We are trying to keep within budget instead of running over a whole lot. I joined council right in the middle of some tight budget talks, and now we have a goal, and we are trying to get to the goal post without moving it this time,” he explained. At a recent meeting, Kusch brought up a concern in his area concerning dust control. The discussion with his fellow councillors resulted in a motion and the creation of a user-pay system. “It felt good. I was trying to find a feasible way to get a program brought back that helps the residents out without financially strapping the county. It felt good to get something out there that residents wanted and that the rest of council was on board with.” He said that getting to phone those residents back to let them know the good news was a wonderful feeling. “They were grateful that somebody listened to them and that we took the time to look into it and made the program available to them. Whether they use it or not, or how many people choose to, is out of my hands, but just knowing the program is there and available again was good.” Kusch and his wife have lived out in the Anselmo area for about eight years. “It’s a lot more private. You have all the subdivisions closer to Whitecourt and areas up in the hill, but I just wanted something where my neighbours are a little further away. I like the privacy and the seclusion of being out here. Both my children are born and raised out here, and we do a lot of horseback riding. There are a lot of beautiful trails in the county.” Kusch said that living in Woodlands County and enjoying the natural environment is the best way to be. “We go kayaking around Blue Ridge, and we like getting the boat out on the water at Goose Lake. We do lots of hiking too. There’s a ton of fun stuff to do out here, and we spend a lot of time outside. It’s a nice area, and we love to utilize it.” Kusch said the Anselmo area is full of community-driven people that would give the shirt off their back. He considers himself to be open and encourages residents to call him to chat. “I’m not always able to answer the phone at the minute they call, but I always get back to people and am always as free as I can be for answering questions or trying to find solutions to stuff. I try to go out of my way to help people, whether it’s resolving issues over road maintenance or other stuff around here. That’s what I’m in this position for.” Though Kusch will only be vying for votes in his area in the upcoming election and not the whole county, he said that the success of Woodlands County comes down to the entire puzzle and not just one piece. “Whether it’s in the Blue Ridge, or Goose Lake area, or Fort Assiniboine or closer to Whitecourt, everything that happens in those areas inadvertently affects every other area. If you take one of the puzzle pieces out, you don’t have the full view of everything going on. I represent this area, but the growth and prosperity of the county, in general, is the ultimate goal for council, and we have to look out for everyone’s needs. Obviously, the people voting here are the ones that are important for my vote, but the big thing is the prosperity of the area. The better the area does, the better everybody does.” Subject: Councils; Special elections"
"2021-08-25","Full text: Parties trade accusations on campaign trail TORONTO - Accusations of wanton spending, misleading the public and prioritizing votes over the crisis in Afghanistan dominated the seventh full day of the federal election campaign. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh began Sunday in Toronto at an event honouring the tenth anniversary of Jack Layton's death. Layton led the NDP for eight years and the party soared to historic heights under his guidance, winning 103 seats in the 2011 election. Singh paid tribute to Layton and his legacy and then took aim at Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's response to the situation in Afghanistan. Choosing his words carefully, Singh said he wondered if the timing of Trudeau's election call has inhibited Canada's ability to help its allies in a country thrown into chaos since it fell to the Taliban this month. ""Maybe the fact that Justin Trudeau called an election might have impacted his ability to plan for the evacuation of our allies in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""And I'm worried about that, I'm thinking that maybe more could have been done."" Singh said he would have sped up evacuations and made the paperwork process simpler for Canadian allies wanting out of Afghanistan. ""The process that Justin Trudeau had put in place required people filling out an online form,"" he said. ""It was complicated, it was bureaucratic. When we've got an imminent humanitarian crisis, that is not the way to respond."" As of Sunday morning, three flights had left the country since the Taliban takeover, carrying fleeing Afghans who once worked with Canadian forces in the war-torn country. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said during a news conference that Canada will work to evacuate people from Afghanistan ""for as long as it is safe to do so."" Meanwhile, the Conservatives took a swipe at Liberal spending with a news release highlighting the purchase of a $40,228 car for Bernadette Jordan, minister of fisheries, oceans and the coast guard. The Conservative press release also pointed to about $218,000 spent on furniture for the ministerial office since Feb. 1, 2019. Jordan was sworn in as minister in November that year. The Liberals said the Conservatives were misleading the public. Jordan didn't have a car when she became fisheries minister, so one was bought for her use, said Liberal spokesperson Brook Simpson. ""As the Conservatives are aware, all cabinet ministers and the leader of the official Opposition, regardless of the party in power, have access to a vehicle to carry out the work of their offices,"" Simpson wrote. Further, the office expenses were incurred during a renovation that began prior to Jordan being sworn in as minister, Simpson said. Pointing to a CBC News story from September 2020 that highlights $170,000 worth of taxpayer-funded renovations to Stornoway, the leader of the Opposition's official residence in Ottawa — and hence O'Toole's home since August 2020 — Simpson asked: ""If the Conservative position is that renovation expenses should be repaid, will O’Toole pay back the $170,000 for his taxpayer-funded residence renovations?"""

"2021-08-24","Full text: Trudeau sits out 6th day of campaign, parties spar The three main federal parties lobbed attacks at each other Saturday, undaunted by the absence of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau on the sixth day of the federal campaign. While it is not unusual for party leaders to take a down day on Saturdays because it's traditionally the day when parties return to home base to regroup, the current election has opened Trudeau up to criticism for launching a campaign as a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. So it was that NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh needed little prompting when reminded of Trudeau's blank itinerary as he began his day in Toronto. ""I don't know what his schedule is and why he's not campaigning ... I can just say for me, on housing specifically and on many other things, Trudeau has been missing in action,"" Singh said, as he promised a supplement of up to $5,000 for those struggling to pay rent and a crackdown on so-called ""renovictions."" . ""He has been missing when it comes to helping people who are struggling with trying to find a place they can rent, (and) with people are struggling to find a place they can buy."" Trudeau called the election last Sunday, triggering a campaign that will send voters to the polls on Sept. 20. At a campaign stop in Edmonton, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole faced questions about his own team's decision to spend the first few days in a downtown Ottawa hotel campaigning on a newly constructed television set. O'Toole said his ""telephone town halls"" allowed him to reach more Canadians ""than all the other leaders combined"" in southwestern Ontario, New Brunswick and Quebec. O'Toole said he's learned as a ""COVID era leader"" how to connect with Canadians and expose the faults of his Liberal opponent. ""I want to connect with as many Canadians as possible that are worried about more years of division under Mr. Trudeau, more cover ups, more ethical breaches,"" he said during a campaign stop in Edmonton. O'Toole also pledged to work better with provincial premiers ""because our country's become fractured under Mr. Trudeau, in part because there's always an Ottawa knows best approach."" That, he said, would include Nova Scotia's new Progressive Conservative Premier Tim Houston who unseated the governing Liberals earlier this week. ""There was a change with the Liberal government that tried to call a snap election in a pandemic,"" O'Toole quipped. The Conservative and Liberal war rooms also volleyed attacks on each other. The Conservative campaign said it had written to the federal ethics commissioner about former Liberal cabinet minister Judy Sgro, a candidate in the Humber River-Black Creek riding. A party release raises concerns about a reported trip she took to Italy in 2017, which was allegedly funded by the Basilicata Cultural Society of Canada. ""According to proactive disclosures on the website for the Ethics (Commissioner), Sgro never publicly disclosed the name of the third party who sponsored her trip to Italy,"" the release said. Sponsored trips are permitted, but MPs must disclose who paid for them, the release said. The Liberals did not immediately respond to request for comment on the matter, but did release a letter of their own to O'Toole concerning a separate issue. The letter was penned by Toronto-area MP Mary Ng, the trade minister when Parliament was dissolved, criticizing the Conservative leader for not backing mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for government employees as well as air and rail passengers. The letter compared O'Toole to Republican politicians in Texas and Florida who have blocked mandatory vaccination. ""If you will not show leadership to protect the health and safety of Canadians, you can't stand in the way of those who will,"" the letter said. ""Will you commit to ensuring that your party, your candidates, and your caucus, will not be permitted to introduce legislation that would ban mandatory vaccine policies or punish businesses and organizations who require their customers and employees to be vaccinated?"" The O'Toole campaign sought to showcase the lack of daylight between the Liberal approach and the Tories', repeating that a Conservative government would require unvaccinated passengers to present a recent negative test result or pass a rapid test hopping on a bus, plane or ship. Unvaccinated federal public servants would also have submit to a daily test. ""(Under) Justin Trudeau's plan for federal employees, those who refuse vaccination will need to consider alternative measures, such as testing and screening,"" party spokesman Cory Hann said in an email. ""The simple fact is that Justin Trudeau's plan for federal employees is the same as Erin O'Toole's."" The Liberals also highlighted a news release from pro-life group RightNow targeting O'Toole. The group is calling on the Conservative leader to say he will not ask medical professionals to refer patients seeking services like abortion or medical assistance in dying to another provider if they object to performing these procedures themselves. “Erin O’Toole promised to pro-lifers during the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership race that he would protect conscience rights of medical professionals across Canada,” said Scott Hayward, co-founder and president of RightNow, in Saturday's news release. Hayward and his group want O'Toole to stick to that commitment, the release said.

"2021-09-21","Full text: The Chief of the Chippewas of Kettle & Stony Point First Nation (KSP) is running as an NDP candidate in the federal election. Jason Henry, a two-term chief and father of three, is the party’s candidate in the rural Lambton-Kent-Middlesex riding in southwestern Ontario. Born and raised in KSP, Henry says he decided to run for the New Democrats after a chance meeting with leader Jagmeet Singh at the Ottawa airport in 2019. While both men were waiting for flights they struck up a conversation about political matters. “Here’s this guy in a hoodie and sweatpants; he’s genuine and down-to-earth,” recalls Henry. He told Singh he was “wondering” about political work beyond his community, and the two exchanged phone numbers. “He seems chill and cool, but he could be running Canada one day,” Henry says. One day in 2020, while driving with his family, his politically-savvy daughter saw Singh’s name appear on their truck’s Bluetooth screen with an incoming call and thought someone was pranking her father. It was the NDP leader though, asking if Henry would join the party and run as a candidate. After a lot of thought Henry accepted. “It’s easy to be a critic and point out all the things wrong with the system. I couldn’t stand outside any longer and complain about a system that I’m not ready to try and fix,” he told Windspeaker.com. “I was really undecided, really committed to my work (as chief),” but after June 1 and the first discovery of the unmarked children’s graves at former residential school sites, Henry decided to throw his hat into the ring. “Maybe a few of us have to make a change and go into that other (federal political) system and do good work and bring our voices,” he remembers telling another First Nation leader at the time. There is an informal network of Indigenous candidates across Canada, Henry says. “There are a few of us and we are in touch. “We’re not all from the same party, but that’s the nature of Canada.” Henry draws inspiration from Indigenous politicians such as Mumilaaq Qaqqaq, the former Inuit NDP MP, and Wab Kinew, leader of Manitoba’s NDP. Kinew is “such an inspiration for young Indigenous people. He’s had his struggles the same as many of us have, but he very likely” could be the next premier of Manitoba. Henry feels the NDP really has the interests of Indigenous people at heart, and he hopes to work on implementing the Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report “so Indigenous people can have truth and justice.” The chief says the other people of his riding have a lot in common with the KSP community. “There’s that attachment to the land,” and farmers and people out in the country are being treated much the same as Indigenous people. “We’re not being heard, not being represented.” While the national agenda seems to be driven largely by urban concerns, “Canada has forgotten what it’s like to be grassroots,” to “work until the sun’s gone down,” whether out on the farm or “back in the bush” collecting maple syrup. “I want to bring my grassroots Indigenous nature to the national stage, share the voice of my riding and share the voice of Indigenous people,” he says. Another priority for Henry is making addiction treatments and harm reduction support more accessible locally. As for the campaign, he won’t be taking a confrontational approach. Others in the race are incumbant Lianne Rood, for the Conservative Party, Dr. Sudit Ranade, for the Liberal Party, Jeremy Hull for the Green Party, and Kevin Mitchell for the People’s Party of Canada. “People are really tired of hearing one party put down the next and talk about how great they are. People want to see Canada working together. That’s how my community got through the pandemic, and that’s how Canada will get through the pandemic,” he said. Henry feels he is well-placed to succeed as an MP because of his ability to listen to what people need and take action to fill those needs. Henry says he believes in “fighting for those who haven’t been able to fight for themselves.” As one example he describes how he worked to include the LGBTQ2S community at KSP by bringing the Pride flag to the community’s powwow. Another accomplishment he cites is the arrival of temporary, prefabricated homes at the former army camp at Stony Point, where KSP protester Dudley George was shot and killed by police in 1995. George and other activists were reclaiming the land, seized for an army camp during the Second World War and not returned. His brother, sister, and others have been living in the old military barracks until the temporary homes were installed last winter, in advance of the construction of more permanent homes. Henry says he “absolutely did not know what was best there, but the people told me exactly what they needed,” he explains. “I may not be a rural farmer, but I can listen to people, I can understand heart-to-heart what they need and I can go and fight for it.” Windspeaker.com Subject: Native peoples; Political activism; Pandemics; Elections"

"2021-08-23","Full text: The Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA) has called on Canada’s federal parties to commit to building safer, more sustainable communities and fostering a better municipal-federal relationship ahead of the Federal Election on Sept. 20. That includes a call to permanently double the Canada Community-Building Fund with a predictable annual growth rate that better reflects economic growth and construction costs. “Municipalities are the order of government closest to the people,” Mayor Rodger Hayward of Naicam, President of SUMA, said in a release. “We understand the needs of our residents, and what we need is federal support to build communities that are safe and sustainable. We also need a relationship where we are at the table when discussions that impact our communities, like infrastructure funding and policing, are had.” A SUMA spokesperson said municipalities collect approximately 10 cents of each Canadian tax dollar, but are responsible for nearly 60 per cent of the public infrastructure. That includes things like roads, water lines and waste disposal. The Canada Community-Building Fund provides funds the upgrading and replacing this infrastructure, the spokesperson said, by providing predictable funding to municipalities of all sizes. SUMA said the fund currently accounts for only two per cent of municipal revenues while the list of unfunded infrastructure projects grows. They said the federal government recognized the benefit of additional funding, by temporarily doubling of transfers in 2019 and again in 2021. That latest increase was designed to help municipalities cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, SUMA said municipalities and local economies need the program to be permanently doubled to help address infrastructure shortfalls and stimulate economic growth. “Building safe, sustainable communities means ensuring that our most vulnerable residents are supported,” said Mayor Gerald Albers of Lloydminster, chair of SUMA’s City Mayors’ Caucus (CMC) and Vice-President of Cities said. “While health and social services are primarily the responsibility of the province, all orders of government have a direct role to play to ensure their safety.” The Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) has also called for the fund to be permanently doubled. The two organizations say boosting the fund helps account for rising construction costs, while maintaining effective economic growth. The request was one of several SUMA made on Thursday. The organization also said there needs to be reliable broadband in all communities, support for resource communities, support to help communities become more climate change resilient, national leadership in public safety and coordinated mental health and addictions support. Saskatchewan’s city mayors and managers discussed issues important to the province’s largest municipalities on Thursday at a CMC meeting in Yorkton.

"2021-08-22","Full text: At the invitation of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Pincher Creek town council requested a meeting with Minister Ric McIver during the annual Alberta Urban Municipalities Association convention. The convention will be held Nov. 17 to 19. During the Aug. 4 committee of the whole meeting, council discussed what topics should be addressed during the meeting with the minister. Municipal Affairs requested that two topics be identified in advance, and council settled on the provincial code of conduct bylaw for municipalities and current challenges facing municipal finances. Talking to Minister McIver about the ministry’s intention to remove the code of conduct for municipalities should be “front and centre,” said Mayor Don Anderberg. “The ministry wants to remove the code of conduct bylaw for councils, and I think that’s absolutely not a good thing to do,” he said. Coun. Lorne Jackson agreed. “I just don’t see the rationale,” Coun. Jackson said. Bringing up financial challenges facing municipalities was also deemed important, with Coun. Scott Korbett initially suggesting council speak with the minister about the stability of the Municipal Sustainability Initiative. At Mayor Anderberg’s suggestion, council opted to keep the topic to general finances rather than focusing on one aspect since the relationship between the province and municipal governments is facing numerous changes. “The issue we really have is the province is now dipping into what historically has been municipal finance operations. Over the last few years, it’s really gone up,” said Mayor Anderberg. The mayor added that 30 per cent of what the town now collects from residents in taxes goes directly to the provincial government for things like education and policing. Since municipalities have no control over provincial requisitions, he said, the fact the amounts will be increasing over the next few years is concerning. Mayor Anderberg also took issue with the town not being allowed to report monetary downloads from the province on municipal tax notices. “Those functions are the functions of the province,” he continued. “My personal thought is if you’re responsible for it, then you figure out where revenue is coming from. It keeps our tax rates up or increases them, so we take the heat and they get the money. I don’t feel it’s very fair.” With municipal elections right around the corner, Coun. Scott Korbett said the timing of the meeting request was a little inconvenient. “It’s funny that he’s asking us for this information knowing there’s a municipal election and it could be all different people at the table so then you’ve got to scramble to figure out what you’re talking about,” he said. The next council meeting will be held Monday, Aug. 23, 6 p.m. in council chambers. Subject: Local elections; Councils; Municipal finance"

"2021-08-22","Full text: There are now six people in contention for the position of Líídlįį Kúę First Nation chief. Dennis Nelner was added to the list of candidates earlier this week. Nelner said he was originally left off the N.W.T. First Nation's ballot because the First Nation believed he owed money dating back to 2010. In a Facebook post, Nelner said had a receipt proving the bill in question had been paid. “I think I had an overwhelming case so, after some reconsideration, they changed their mind and there was a letter and they apologized – and that’s what I asked for,” he said. “I’m happy with that. I don’t think I have to belabour that point very much. I’m more interested in the election and promoting my messages.” The election takes place on Monday, August 23. Posted to Facebook on Tuesday, the First Nation’s new list of six candidates now includes Nelner alongside Kele Charles Antoine, Olinto Beaulieu, William M. C. Michaud, Herb Norwegian, and Hilda Tsetso. Gerry Antoine, the present chief, is not seeking re-election. He is instead running for Dene National Chief against incumbent Norman Yakeleya.

"2021-08-22","Full text: PC premier-designate Tim Houston is seemingly faced with a dilemma. He must appoint a minister to the Office of African Nova Scotian Affairs with no African Nova Scotian members in his caucus to choose from. This comes as Tuesday’s election saw a record number of four Black MLA candidates voted into the provincial legislature. There have been two white ministers of African Nova Scotian Affairs in the past — Barry Barnet and Maureen MacDonald. When the office was first launched in 2003, PC premier John Hamm appointed Barnet as the inaugural minister. At the time, there were no Black MLAs serving in the legislature. In 2006, the NDP’s Percy Paris was elected and sat as the sole Black MLA. Paris was just the third Black MLA to be elected, having been preceded by Liberal MLA Wayne Adams and NDP MLA Yvonne Atwell.* Barnet served as minister of African Nova Scotian affairs until 2009 when the NDP won a majority government, and Paris was then sworn in as the new — and first Black — minister of African Nova Scotian Affairs. Paris served as minister until 2013 when he was replaced by a white NDP MLA Maureen MacDonald following an altercation between Paris and Preston MLA Keith Colwell. MacDonald served for only a few months before the Liberals won a majority government in 2013. Liberals Stephen Gough and Tony Ince were now the only two Black MLAs in the legislature. Ince was sworn in as minister of African Nova Scotian Affairs and has served in the role ever since. Though provincial cabinet minters are usually appointed from the governing party's elected caucus, technically speaking, it’s not a rule. According to the legislature’s website: And so technically speaking, if he wanted to, Houston could appoint a Black minister of African Nova Scotian Affairs. As former NDP cabinet minister, Graham Steele once pointed out: If he wanted, Houston could appoint one of the newly elected Black MLAs — Ali Duale, Suzy Hansen, or Angela Simmonds. If he wanted, he could choose to keep Ince, who has served two terms as the minister and will now be serving his third term in the legislature. He could choose to appoint one of the three Black PC candidates who ran in this election — Archy Beals, Lisa Coates, or Darrell Johnson. If he wanted to, Houston could appoint any number of qualified and respected non-elected members of the Black/African Nova Scotian community who have extensive background and expertise in issues dealing with so-called African Nova Scotian affairs. The Examiner attempted to contact premier-designate Houston for input on this story. We did not hear back. The Examiner also attempted to contact the four Black MLAs now elected to the legislature. Aside from Ali Duale, who was unable to provide input due to a scheduling conflict, we were only able to reach Angela Simmonds. We asked Simmonds if she thinks Houston should appoint someone Black and/or one of the newly elected Black MLAs. Simmond said: The Examiner asked Simmonds if she would accept the appointment if it was offered to her. This past election was one of many historic firsts. The three main political parties were said to have run their most diverse slate of candidates in history. Of the candidates, a record total of 11 were Black. The Examiner was first to highlight that for the first time in Atlantic Canada, one riding — Preston — was guaranteed to elect a Black MLA. The three main parties all chose to run a Black candidate in the Preston riding. It was also highly touted that, coincidentally, Preston had returned to a “protected riding” status this election, in an effort to increase the overall percentage of Black voters in the riding. All of these aspects were highlighted and pointed to as measures meant to increase and promote Black representation and diversity in provincial politics. So now what? Houston’s dilemma comes in the wake of a global Black Lives Matter movement that made waves just last year throughout the province in places like Halifax, Truro, Wolfville, Windsor, Amherst, Kentville, two in New Glasgow, Digby, Cape Breton, Yarmouth, and other places throughout the Maritimes. It comes in the wake of criticism, just last year, for the previous government's announcement of a hand-picked racial justice “design team”, to which there have been no updates since. Houston’s dilemma also comes in the immediate wake of activists and leaders in the Black community and a newly elected Black MLA (Angela Simmonds) and a Black Halifax police officer saying that racial profiling by police in the province still takes place — this, despite a police apology, and a provincial policy change following the release of an independent report. Houston was recently spotted at the Emancipation Day celebration at Parade Square in Halifax speaking with Black PC candidates Darrell Johnson and Lisa Coates, as well as notable Black community members such as Derico Symonds from Gamechangers 902, Senator Wanda Thomas Bernard, educator and entrepreneur Bernadette Hamilton Reid, and videographer and music producer Keke Beats. It will be interesting to note what, if any, sort of counsel he seeks from Black community members such as these with respect to the appointment, and what specific details of those conversations will be made public. In response to the question of who Houston should appoint, on the Black Nova Scotia News Facebook page, former two-time provincial PC candidate, Irvine Carvery, who is Black, said: [Note: MLA Brad Johns was the official critic for the office]."

"2021-08-22","Full text: Nova Scotia voter turnout near record low HALIFAX - Despite more options for Nova Scotians to cast ballots in Tuesday's provincial election, turnout was close to a historic low. Slightly more than 55 per cent of registered voters cast ballots — close to 423,000 people — out of the roughly 759,000 who had the right to vote, figures released Thursday by Elections Nova Scotia indicated. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government with 38.4 per cent support — or 162,478 votes, about one-fifth of the electorate. That mandate offers them effective control over the legislature and its committees, and it gives them important influence on day-to-day services ranging from the availability of family doctors to the state of the roads and schools. Records from Elections Nova Scotia show a steady drop in voter turnout over the decades, from 82 per cent in 1960 to a historic low of 53.4 per cent in the 2017 general election won by the Liberals. A spokeswoman for Elections Nova Scotia says the agency is declining comment on voter turnout until all post-election analysis is complete. Political scientists, however, have noted that the agency introduced innovations to make voting more accessible during the 41st general election, ranging from easy-to-access community polls to mail-in ballots. Tom Urbaniak, a political science professor at Cape Breton University, said in an interview Friday turnout could have been worse but the figures are nonetheless concerning. ""I'm relieved the voter turnout was higher than the psychological threshold of 50 per cent (of the electorate) and it didn't decline from the 2017 election,"" he said. ""But there were many opportunities to vote, over many days … So there's definitely important work to be done to raise voter interest and emphasize the importance of civic engagement."" He said the drop in voter turnout since the 1960s and 1970s can be explained by the end of a patronage system in the province, in which some voters cast ballots out of inherited loyalties to parties and because they expected jobs and contracts when their parties took power. But he said other reasons for the decline can be explained by a greater transience in the population, which he said often leads to citizens who are less rooted and engaged in political issues. ""It often takes young adults longer to establish themselves in a community, and the habits of voting and acquainting themselves with the issues in a community have been lost to some extent,"" Urbaniak said. When major issues appear to be at stake, voter turnout tends to rebound, as occurred in the Quebec independence referendums, he noted. Urbaniak also cited the work of American political scientist Robert Putnam, who has discussed the drop in so-called social capital, which Putnam described as the connections between individuals through social networks in their communities. ""The decline in voter turnout is linked to other indicators, such as the decline in following mainstream media, in attending public meetings and even visiting other people in their homes,"" Urbaniak said. Putnam's research indicated that as citizens engage with one another less frequently in these social settings, their tendency to vote declines, he added. During the provincial campaign, Tory Leader Tim Houston criticized the Liberals for calling the election in the middle of summer, suggesting his opponents were deliberating hoping for a poor turnout that would benefit the governing party. Houston has pledged to create fixed election dates for the province. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 20, 2021. Subject: Provincial elections; Elections; Voter behavior"

"2021-08-22","Full text: Fort Liard's Acho Dene Koe First Nation has chosen not to pursue further court action regarding its delayed and controversial process to elect a chief. According to a news release posted to the First Nation's Facebook page on Thursday, the option of going to court to question an appeal committee’s earlier ruling – that April's election must be held again, with former chief Floyd Bertrand no longer disqualified from running – is “too costly.” The First Nation had already applied to a federal court in July, an application that in essence reserved the right to launch a more detailed legal challenge once it had inspected the appeal committee's full rationale for that ruling. Acho Dene Koe surveyed its members last week about what to do. According to Thursday's news release, about 60 percent of respondents – it wasn't clear how many people took part in the survey – wanted court action to proceed. However, the First Nation said the expected cost of that legal action was sufficiently high that its council had ""decided not to proceed with further litigation."" Instead, the First Nation said it interpreted the majority vote for court action as a need for ""clarity concerning the debt requirement prior to holding the election for chief."" Bertrand had been ruled ineligible to run in April's election because of a reported debt of $27,500 owed to the First Nation for more than a decade. The one-man appeal committee – lawyer Garth Wallbridge – ruled there was not enough evidence to show the money was actually owed, and too much time had now passed to bar Bertrand from running. Thursday's news release stated the First Nation, having chosen not to pursue the request of the majority of survey respondents, will now consult community members about which debt rules, if any, should apply in future elections. There remains no date scheduled for a re-run of April's chief election. According to Thursday's news release, council is ""continuing to take the necessary steps to call an election for chief"" such as selecting a date, recruiting an elections officer, and finding representatives for an appeal committee. An update on work to reschedule the election is expected at a council meeting next month. Subject: Polls & surveys; Councils; White collar crime; Elections"

In 1463, King Louis XI died after ruling France for 22 years. He was known for his diplomatic skills -- he was nicknamed the ""Spider King"" for his web of machinations -- and considered one of France's most successful kings in terms of uniting the country. Because of his fears of assassination, he spent his last years in virtual self-imprisonment near Tours. In 1780, American revolutionary general Benedict Arnold made a secret pact with the British to surrender the American fort at West Point, N.Y.

She died in 1851. In 1812, the first settlers, mostly Scottish, arrived at the Red River colony in Manitoba. Thomas Douglas, Earl of Selkirk, sent a former soldier, Miles Macdonell, to establish the colony on land he had received from the Hudson's Bay Co. Macdonell was appointed governor of the new colony. Destroyed in a feud with the North West Co. in 1815, the colony was re-established by Selkirk in 1817. In 1813, more than 500 settlers were killed by Natives in the Massacre of Fort Mims, near Mobile, Ala. In 1851, the legislative council of British Columbia held its first session.

"2021-08-22","Full text: Premier Doug Ford has yet to to issue a formal statement on the matter, but the Ontario PC party are expressing their regret for sending out fundraising letters made to look like invoices. Opposition parties expressed their outrage yesterday after the letters made their way to the mailboxes of Ontario residents. The letters, made out to look like a standard bill and requesting anywhere from $300 to $1000, arrived to a number of confused Ontario residents with former or current ties to the Conservative party on Tuesday. Discussion online has many assuming the difference in amounts requested has been based on postal code with higher invoices being sent to traditionally higher income locations, though that has not been confirmed. There is also worry that the misleading nature of the letter is aimed to take advantage of the most vulnerable, like seniors and those with lower English speaking skills. In a statement to media, the Liberal party say “the misleading document, which includes the word ‘invoice’ in large text at the top, is similar to those used in ‘false billing scams’ that aim to defraud vulnerable individuals."" The party added that they would be formally requesting an investigation through Elections Ontario and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, supported by both the Ontario NDPs and Green Party. The letter included with the invoice, signed off on by the Chair of the Ontario PC Fund Tony Miele, included statements (bolded, as they are in the letter) like the following: “The bottom line is you don’t win elections without a well-stocked campaign war-chest. Doug Ford and your Ontario PC team rely on your generous donations to our Election Readiness Fund in preparation for the coming 2022 provincial election."" The word ""donation"" also doesn't appear until near the bottom of the page. Miele confirmed in an interview with Global News that the company responsible for the letters was Responsive Marketing Group (RMG), but would not reveal who approved them. The party apologized in a statement saying it was ""not their intention to mislead our valued supporters"" and assuring that it won't happen again, but made no mention of returning funds to anyone who may have sent them out of confusion.

"2021-08-22","Full text: The 2021 Federal Election is in full swing and in the third day of the campaign since Parliament was dissolved by Governor General Mary Simon, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau made a brief campaign stop in Aurora. Trudeau, accompanied by Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill Liberal candidate Leah Taylor Roy, visited Machell’s Alley, the new gathering space on Yonge Street, located just south of Wellington Street, to meet with residents on August 17 before stopping in at local businesses near the busy intersection. The stop, which was briefly marred by anti-mask protestors, was the first visit of a Federal leader to either of Aurora’s ridings ahead of the September 20 election. In Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill, Ms. Taylor Roy is making a second attempt to unseat Conservative incumbent Leona Alleslev on a ballot which also includes Ceylan Borgers as candidate for the Green Party. An NDP candidate for Aurora’s south riding had not been confirmed at press time. In Newmarket-Aurora, however, Yvonne Kelly will carry the NDP’s orange banner, challenging incumbent Liberal Tony Van Bynen and freshman Conservative candidate Harold Kim, who is taking a leave of absence from Aurora Council for the duration of the campaign. Also in the race is Lana Morgan, representing the People’s Party of Canada. Hours before the Liberal leader visited Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill, Ms. Alleslev questioned the timing of the election, particularly as the fight against COVID-19 continues. “This is the fourth wave,” Ms. Alleslev told The Auroran. “From a focus and energy perspective, we should be focused on getting everybody positioned for post-COVID economic recovery. $500 million could very well be spent on more important things than an election, like making investments in those fundamental things to get our economy, health and safety back on track, and this is just a challenge in this timeframe. There is no reason to go for an election now, other than for Justin, I can only guess, to try and get a majority.” These sentiments were shared by both Mr. Kim and Ms. Kelly. “Less than two years after the last [election] doesn’t make sense and even more so given that we have just started on the fourth wave,” said Mr. Kim of the September 20 poll date. “Can we afford to take attention away from managing COVID for five weeks? I think the Liberals need to focus on COVID and not on their political fortunes.” Added Ms. Kelly: “We don’t know what we’re going to be facing in the next few months with the potential fourth wave. I don’t really agree with the timing of [the election], but it wasn’t unexpected.”"

"2021-08-22","Full text: Canadians are set to go to the polls on September 20. While the total number of candidates vying to be the next Members of Parliament for the ridings of Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill and Newmarket-Aurora is yet to be determined, those who had been confirmed by Monday, August 16, spoke to The Auroran on key issues that have emerged in the lead-up to last Sunday’s election call and into the first week of the campaign. Individuals looking to represent Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill – the segment of Aurora on the south side of Wellington Street – are incumbent Conservative Leona Alleslev and Liberal Leah Taylor Roy, two candidates who faced each other in the polls in the fall of 2019. On the north side of Wellington Street – the riding of Newmarket-Aurora – incumbent Liberal Tony Van Bynen is being challenged by Conservative Harold Kim and NDP candidate Yvonne Kelly. AURORA-OAK RIDGES-RICHMOND HILL “Reprioritize and refocus” is the message Leona Alleslev says she hopes would be a top-of-mind election issue for voters if the election were held today rather than in the second half of next month. “There were challenges before COVID in our economics, in our trade, in our relationships and even in our own domestic capacity to look after ourselves for critical things,” says Ms. Alleslev. “COVID has shown that even more. The ballot question is: how are we going to reprioritize and refocus on things for the next five, 10, 15 years, that will position us for self-sufficiency in critical areas, jobs and the economy, and stronger international relationships, diplomatically, militarily and economically.”"

"2021-09-21","Full text: (ANNews) - Indigenous people won’t be able to vote on reserve in the upcoming plebiscites and senate elections happening the same day as municipal elections on Oct. 18, Alberta Municipal Affairs has confirmed. Plebiscite questions include whether Alberta should adopt Daylight Savings Time for the entire year, and whether Albertans support removing Constitutionally-enshrined equalization payments that send funds collected from federal income taxes to less wealthy provinces. Adam North Peigan, a member of the Piikani First Nation and president of the Sixties Scoop Indigenous Society of Alberta, says not making arrangements for Indigenous peoples to vote on reserve is a brazen form of disenfranchisement. “I was completely appalled,” said Peigan. “These issues should have input from all Albertans, whether you’re pink, blue or black.” Since reserves aren’t technically municipalities, their elections occur on a different timeline. “However, when you’re going to tie important questions through a referendum to those municipal elections that are going to affect all Albertans, including ones who live on First Nations reserves, we should be entitled to have our say in that,” Peigan said. A spokesperson for Minister Ric McIver told Alberta Native News that people who live on reserve, as well as those in summer villages, special areas, improvement areas and the Alberta side of Lloydminster, will have to either travel to the nearest municipality or vote by mail. “Every Albertan will have the opportunity to vote in the upcoming senate election and referenda,” says McIver spokesperson Mark Jacka. Work is underway on partnering First Nations reserves with the closest municipality that is having a civic election, who will then provide voting information to residents, Jacka said. But Peigan says this is insufficient in upholding First Nations’ voting rights. He says the province must set up polling stations on reserve to ensure First Nations have the same ability to vote as anyone living in a municipality. The government’s approach is “totally negligent” and “a slap in the face” to the First Peoples living in Alberta, he added. Left-wing senate candidate Duncan Kinney, who says he’s running to highlight the absurdity of elections for a position appointed by the prime minister, shares Peigan’s concerns. “These ‘senate elections’ put on by Premier Jason Kenney have always been a sham, but he is taking them seriously,” says Kinney. That Indigenous peoples who live on reserve will have to make extra effort to vote moves these elections from the realm of political theatre into “just another instance of white supremacy in action,” he said. Emergency room physician Dr. Sunil Sookram, who’s also running for senate, says not having polling stations on reserve could “negatively impact many Albertans with disabilities, or have financial hardships impacting transport to neighbouring communities,” as well as seniors who might have mobility issues. “I empathize and also worry about possible disenfranchisement of a significant and important population in Alberta,” Sookram said, encouraging those who cannot vote in person to do so by mail.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Sunday's announcement that the nation will be going to the polls on September 20, was no surprise. The political adds started turning up on radio several weeks ago followed by rumours that the Prime Minister would be taking a walk over to Rideau Hall on Sunday to ask the Governor General to call an election. That gives federal political parties only five weeks to get their candidates in place, deliver a platform, and get out there to shake hands, or these days, nod heads and maybe fist bump with constituents and explain why they deserve the vote. As of the election call, only one of the three major political parties had a candidate in place for the riding of Simcoe-Grey. That excludes the Bloc Quebecois which has 32 seats in parliament but is active only in Quebec during federal elections. Of the fringe parties, only one has a confirmed candidate. So far, the only two candidates are: Conservative Party of Canada Terry Dowdall – incumbent Mr. Dowdall was elected to the federal riding of Simcoe-Grey in the 2019 general election with just over 43 per cent of the vote. He is currently a member of the Standing Committee on National Defence. Prior to entering federal politics, he had 18 years of municipal experience including being the mayor of the Township of Essa. He was elected as Simcoe County Deputy Warden in 2014 and 2016, and finished his municipal career as Acting Warden. He won the Conservative Party of Canada nomination in March 2018 for Simcoe-Grey. Mr. Dowdall has served three terms on the board of directors of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. People's Party of Canada Candidate: Adam Minatel"

"2021-08-21","Full text: It’s going to be tough for a challenger to unseat the Conservative incumbent in either of Wellington County’s two federal ridings, and if it does happen, it’s likely to be due to forces at the national not local level, says a University of Guelph political science professor. “I would never say never, we always have elections where we have big shifts, but they’re not common,” professor Tamara Small said, evaluating the chances of a Liberal, NDP or Green candidate being elected in the county. “It’s going to be difficult.” Wellington–Halton Hills and Perth–Wellington have both been held by the Conservative Party since the electoral districts were first contested in 2004. Michael Chong has been the MP for Wellington–Halton Hills for the entire 17 years the riding has been in existence. In Perth–Wellington, John Nater succeeded a fellow Conservative when he was elected for the first time in 2015. As both men seek another term on Sept. 20, Small said they benefit from “the incumbent bonus,” the idea that incumbents tend to win again. Plus, because the margin of their victories has been so large, it makes it difficult for other parties to recruit candidates to face them, she explained. It also means with limited funds and time, parties are likely to make the calculation it’s not worth devoting major resources to campaigns in Wellington County. “Parties do not put their money and resources in two places,"" Small said. ""Places that they’re going to win, and places that they’re going to lose."" Similarly you're not likely to see party leaders visit Wellington County, with the exception of Conservative Party leader Erin O'Toole who might stop by to ""shore-up excitement,"" Small explained. Instead parties focus on ridings that are determined to be “in play,” which generally means the difference between the first place and second place candidate is 10 per cent or less. “Because you can move 10 per cent of voters, which means that you could win, but if you’re trying to move 20 per cent of voters, that’s a lot of people,” Small said. Political scientist Tom Flanagan calls this ""the Rule of 10."" In 2019 Chong captured 47 per cent of the vote, while the liberal candidate in second place received 28 per cent, a difference of 19 percentage points Nater meanwhile won with 46 per cent of the vote, followed by the next closest candidate at 27 per cent, also a difference of 19 percentage points. When big shifts that do happen, it’s most likely due to something happening on the national stage, explained Small. For example, in 2011 the Orange Wave delivered the NDP 59 seats in Quebec, a province where the party had never won more than one seat in a general election. In 2015, the Liberals swept to power after increasing their seat count fivefold from 36 to 184. “On day-one of the campaign, it doesn't look like this is that kind of election,” said Small. “But this is going to be a campaign, in some ways, like no other.” There’s no precedent for how voters might feel if cases suddenly surge in Ontario, making it hard to speculate on how the election might play out, said Small. Meanwhile, candidates challenging conservative incumbents might be able to capitalize on animosity toward Premier Doug Ford, but Small's not sure it will be enough to move a critical mass of voters in Wellington County. ""If we were at 10 per cent, I might say Ford dislike might move 10 per cent,"" Small said. ""But we're not at 10 per cent."" Subject: Elections; Political parties"

"2021-08-21","Full text: Last evening Bonfield’s council filled a seat left vacant after Sylvie Beaudoin resigned in May. Jason Corbett was appointed to the position from a pool of seven potential candidates. Usually, when a municipality is looking to fill a vacant seat, they refer to the previous election’s vote count and see if the next person on that list is interested. Bonfield was in a bit of a pickle, as there was one person on that list, and he had moved out of the municipality. Another option was to call an election, although with one year remaining on council’s term, they decided to forgo that option and save those expenses. They decided to invite the candidates to appear via Zoom during their regular meeting. Five of the seven appeared. Each had an opportunity to make a brief speech, followed by questions from Mayor and council. Once questions concluded, it was time to “go down the list alphabetically and call each member of council one by one on a recorded vote,” said chief administrative officer, Peter Johnston, explaining the process. Clerk Andree Gagne then read the candidates names, and each councillor offered their vote aloud. Each candidate received one vote in the first round. Deadlocked, “now we go to round two,” Johnston said, “and it needs to be said that you’re not required to vote the same as you did in round one.” “Because obviously if you do, we will have the same result.” No new speeches were delivered, and no new questions were asked before the second round of voting. Corbett’s name was called first—as per the alphabetical list—and he received three votes. Voting ceased there, and Corbett was declared the new councillor. “That caught me by surprise,” Mayor Randy McLaren said. “I didn’t realize that our process was over.” “We had three votes for one candidate,” Johnston clarified, “and that’s what’s required.” “As I mentioned from the outset,” Mayor McLaren said, “there’s a sting in this process and that’s certainly evident on the faces of some of the participants, and I apologize for that.” He then acknowledged half-jokingly that the process was an “agonizing approach to pick a councillor,” after thanking each candidate for their interest. “We had a very strong field of candidates here, and there’s certainly room for all your input,” he said, adding that all candidates are “active and valuable members of our community.” Corbett looks forward to serving on council. Since moving to the community three years ago from North Bay, he has been “giving back quite a bit of time within the community,” and believes the “small town with big heart, has enormous potential for growth opportunities.” Recently, Corbett completed the Municipal Administration Program through the Association of Municipal Clerks and Treasurers of Ontario, admitting “a passion for the work that municipalities do.” Corbett has much experience in management and administration, having been involved with the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation, North Bay Economic Development Corporation, “and senior leadership roles within various organizations” throughout the region. “I’m a proud resident of Bonfield,” he said, and looks forward “to joining the team to continue making great progress within the municipality.” Corbett will be sworn in during the next council meeting and will serve until November 2022.

"2021-08-21","Full text: PC incumbent Kim Masland is returning to the legislature for another four years, only this time she’ll be a member of Nova Scotia’s ruling party. Masland quickly jumped out to a massive lead in yesterday’s election and never looked back. After just three polls were counted, she led with 241 votes compared to 47 collected by her next closest competitor, Liberal candidate Susan MacLeod, who had just 47. She finished with 69.81 per cent of the vote or a total of 3,527 votes, well ahead of MacLeod, who finished second with 1,051 votes. The NDP’s Mary Dahr had 321 votes, and Brian Muldoon of the Green Party 153. A total of 8,868 people were registered to vote in Queens; 5,052, or 57.22 per cent of that number, cast their vote. There were 17 ballots rejected and five declined. Masland told LighthouseNOW she didn’t take anything for granted, worked hard for the win and was exhausted. “We hit the ground running five minutes after the election was called,” she said, noting she and her team knocked on more than 5,000 doors during the campaign. “We’re celebrating our hard-earned victory… We had such an amazing team.” According to Masland, the number one issue she heard about on the doorsteps was health care, which was at the forefront of the PCs’ campaign across the province. “People are scared, people are worried about accessing health care and I heard that at every step. People were sharing with me their fear and their personal stories of the health care crisis we're in,” explained Masland. “They’re looking for hope, looking for solutions and we, as a party, put forward our plans over a year ago for Nova Scotians to digest, and they did digest it, and we’re seeing that tonight.” She admitted that being a part of the governing party will be a massive change for her. “I’m ecstatic. When you’re in government this is when you can affect change… “The real work begins tonight, we’ve done our leg work and now it’s time to put the solutions that we have brought forth in to play, to make lives better for Nova Scotians.” Provincially, she said Iain Rankin went into the campaign riding the coattails of former Liberal premier Stephen McNeil, and thought maybe by calling an election in the middle of the summer, and during a pandemic, that people would be disengaged. “You would think that way, but people, Nova Scotians, are engaged and that’s why they turned out in droves at the early polls to make sure their voice was heard in this campaign,” she said. Early on after the polls closed, Elections Nova Scotia’s map of elected and leading candidates was awash with PC blue.

"2021-08-21","Full text: Nova Scotia’s Progressive Conservative win over the Liberals on Tuesday night has officially toppled any notion that incumbents can coast to re-election, and should make federal strategists perk up, experts and insiders say. Liberal Leader Iain Rankin called the snap election to capitalize on Nova Scotia’s handling of the pandemic. But despite leading in the polls heading to election day, his party was reduced to Opposition status as premier-designate Tim Houston’s PCs surged to a majority government. Houston ran a campaign focused on health care, promising to invest about half a billion dollars more annually, while Rankin suggested the PCs were trying to buy votes with expensive programs. Houston was “running on things that are just flat out not traditional conservative platform pieces,” said former NDP premier Darrell Dexter. “This is a guy who said that he would put half a billion dollars more into health care, and didn't really seem to be concerned about a deficit, and doesn't plan to balance the books this term.” Dexter, who ran the province’s NDP government from 2009 to 2013 before Stephen McNeil’s Liberals took over (McNeil resigned in February, passing the torch to Rankin), said he’s questioning whether this should be thought of as a pandemic election or not. Is “this a pandemic election or a post-pandemic election?” he said. “And I don't mean that in the sense of the actual pandemic itself because everybody acknowledges that it's going on, but … people are looking beyond the pandemic to the management of the issues they care about in the coming years. “There's a certain kind of feeling that, yes, the federal government and provincial government here did a good job managing the pandemic, but that is, after all, their job, so you don't necessarily get credit for that,” he said. Take Winston Churchill looking to capitalize on the fall of Nazi Germany, but losing his re-election bid in 1945 despite his wartime popularity, Dexter said. “Management during a crisis — the skills that you have on display — are not necessarily the same skills that people are looking for after the crisis has passed,” he said. Dalhousie University political science professor Katherine Fierlbeck cited Churchill, too. “(Churchill) was a leader for the war, but when the war was over, people wanted to move on,” she said, explaining that a similar dynamic may have played out in Nova Scotia. “For almost eight years, we had a Liberal government that had a clear autocratic streak, with a very heavy top-down, non-consultative approach to governing, and … the party itself was just limping along,” she said, referring to McNeil’s tenure. “But then COVID hit, and this style of leadership was just the ticket for dealing with the pandemic. “I think the provincial Liberals assumed that the election could be fought largely on its management of (the pandemic), but in the end, it wasn't enough.” Fierlbeck said not resting on pandemic management laurels is likely the most important lesson for federal strategists, but there are a handful of other reasons Ottawa insiders should pay attention. Among them is a willingness to spend public dollars, and the importance of health care to voters. “Like the federal Liberals, this new provincial government has expressed no qualms about spending vast amounts of money to fix things in the short term, and it seems to have worked in Nova Scotia,” she said. That means Houston’s gambit to bet big on health-care spending stands in contrast to Erin O’Toole’s strategy to go after Justin Trudeau over what he considers excessive pandemic spending. Fierlbeck says that even though the big spending plans may have worked in Nova Scotia, the N.S. Progressive Conservatives are “essentially another Liberal party,” so it would be a mistake to assume a PC win is a boon for the conservatives nationally. “Tim Houston is no Erin O'Toole,” she said. “If anything, Houston seems to fit the bill of a Trudeausian Liberal much more, so on that reading, the question is: (Is) it O'Toole or Trudeau who should be feeling the heart palpitations of anxiety here?”"
"2021-08-21","Full text: Fort Simpson, N.W.T. has been told it must wait until after September’s federal election to discover whether the village is eligible for the federal Nutrition North program. Village administrators met with officials from the program on Tuesday. They want Fort Simpson to get Nutrition North's help during freeze-up and break-up, as was recently pledged to five other N.W.T. communities. Nutrition North helps lower the cost of food and essential items in participating communities. Mayor Sean Whelly said ""preliminarily, things look good"" for Fort Simpson to join the program, but federal officials say no decision can be made until after polling day on September 20. The five-week delay brought about by the election will narrow the window for Fort Simpson to be added before the next fall freeze-up season, during which the community will temporarily lose road access with no ferry and no ice road. The community ferry's average closing date over the past 15 years has been November 3. “It was a positive phone call,” said Whelly. “They believe that it looks positive for us to get onto the program, but they have to do a little more research themselves. “They’re saying because of the election, the way government works, nothing new can be added to the program until the election is over.” Fort Simpson argues it, too, deserves the seasonal Nutrition North access now offered to Nahanni Butte, Tsiigehtchic, Fort McPherson, Inuvik, and Tuktoyaktuk in the spring and fall. Whelly says the village is isolated for about 54 days a year by his calculation, a figure similar to that experienced by the other communities. Delivery of supplies can also be disrupted by maximum weight limits on the ice road or the sudden closure of the ferry, meaning food must be flown into the community at extra cost. “We don’t quite make it as far as having two months of seasonal disruption,"" said Whelly, ""but if you look a little deeper, there’s a longer period where we’re impacted and actually have to do air shuttle.” Subject: Nutrition"
"2021-08-21","Full text: N.S. legislature increases Black, female presence HALIFAX - The representation of Black and female members has risen notably in Nova Scotia's legislature following Tuesday's provincial election, but no one who identifies as Indigenous was elected in the vote — or at any point in the province's history. Four Black people won ridings this week, which is a historic change; before Tuesday, a total of five African Nova Scotians had won seats since the province's first election in 1758. Suzy Hansen, a newly elected NDP member of the legislature, referred to the change in Black and female representation as ""wonderful, compared to what we had before."" The day after she won her riding of Halifax Needham, the 42-year-old politician stood at the police barricades of a chaotic demonstration against the city's decision to tear down shelters for the homeless. She said her presence as a Black woman was a visible reminder of her community's experience. ""We know what it's like to be pushed out of our homes, when you recall what happened in Africville,"" she said, referring to a Black community in Halifax where residents were evicted from 1964 to 1970 in the name of urban renewal. Ali Duale, the new Liberal member for Halifax Armdale, said he felt inspired to run by party leader Iain Rankin during their encounter at a vigil in June after a Muslim family was struck down and killed by a vehicle in London, Ont. ""(Rankin) said 'If you want to see change, the best way is to put your name on the ballot,' and that touched my heart,"" said Duale, who fled Somalia in the 1990s and is a practising Muslim. Twenty women were elected in Tuesday's vote, representing 36 per cent of the 55 members. That's compared to the 15 women who were in the former 51-seat legislature, representing 29 per cent of all members.

B’nai Brith Canada says the Beth Sholom Synagogue in midtown Toronto was vandalized with a swastika symbol and other graffiti. In a similar incident earlier this week, the campaign signs of two Jewish MPs running for re-election in Montreal were defaced with swastikas. B’nai Brith Canada says a sign drawing awareness to antisemitism in Toronto was also vandalized with antisemitic rhetoric Wednesday. And a school in a Jewish neighbourhood in Thornhill, Ont., was hit with swastikas and other obscene graffiti on Monday. Police in Toronto, Montreal and York Region say they are investigating the incidents. ""The continued use of the Nazi swastika in an attempt to intimidate Jewish communities is reprehensible and unacceptable,"" said Michael Mostyn, chief executive officer of B’nai Brith Canada, in a statement. ""We trust that our law enforcement partners will investigate these matters diligently and do everything possible to apprehend the perpetrators."" B'Nai Brith also said that May had the highest number of antisemitic assaults since it began keeping track in 1983. ""More antisemitic assaults were reported to B'nai Brith in May of 2021 than in all of 2020, 2019 and 2018 combined,"" the organization said.

"2021-08-21","Full text: Albertans will be busy at the polls this fall as Justin Trudeau announced a federal election will take place on Sept. 20. Albertans will also be voting on Oct. 18 for the municipal elections. The Prime Minister announced Sunday morning, saying he had just spoken with Governor General Mary Simon at Rideau Hall in Ottawa and asked her to dissolve the government. Chris Warkentin, MP for Grande Prairie-Mackenzie, will be seeking re-election. “It's clear to everybody that the Prime Minister only called this election because he believed that he could catch Canadians off guard and other parties off guard, and then he'd be able to secure a majority. “I think that he is going to be disappointed when he finds out that Canadians will not just reward him with the majority,” said Warkentin. “I think that there's a lot of people in the Peace Country that are completely fed up with the Liberal government and are looking for the opportunity to voice that concern and frustration,” he said. “The paramount priority for our party, and for myself personally, is to rebuild the local, provincial, and the national economy,” said Warkentin. “We as Albertans know that the energy sector is a major driver in terms of economic opportunity and prosperity for our province.” “We need a government that will actually support the industry, and that will recognize its importance and will sell the merits of the industry and the product that we produce here in the province of Alberta, around the world.” The Peoples Party of Canada will have Shawn McLean running for the Grande Prairie-Mackenzie riding. McLean did not respond to media requests before the time of publication. Running for the Maverick party, Ambrose Ralph will be the candidate for Grande Prairie-Mackenzie. As of Wednesday morning, the Liberals, NDP, and Green party do not have anyone running in the Grande Prairie-Mackenzie riding according to their party websites.

"2021-08-21","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Aug. 19 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 19, 2021 ... What we are watching in Canada ... The federal election campaign turns its focus to Western Canada today, with two of the three national leaders holding events in the region. In Victoria, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau will make an announcement on support for seniors, while New Democrat head Jagmeet Singh will speak on health care in Edmonton. Singh will also campaign on behalf of local candidates -- one of whom, Heather McPherson, was the only non-Conservative to win an Alberta seat in the last federal election. Erin O'Toole's Conservative campaign moves to Central Canada. He'll be making an announcement in Nepean, Ont., and has scheduled two virtual telephone town halls for voters in New Brunswick and Ontario. On Wednesday, Trudeau found himself targeted by his rivals over the cost of living, facing broadsides from Conservatives for the decade-high pace of price growth and the NDP for high housing prices. The country's headline inflation barometer clocked in at 3.7 per cent in July, which Statistics Canada said was the highest year-over-year increase since May 2011 as price growth accelerated from June. --- Also this ... Canadians observing the Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan say they're skeptical of the group's claims that women's rights will be respected under Islamic law. When the Taliban ruled in the 1990s, girls weren't permitted to attend school, women were not allowed to work, and many were subject to rape and forced marriages. A spokeswoman for the not-for-profit Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan -- which raises funds to support teachers and for education supplies, among other things -- says the organization is very worried about the possibility of gross human rights violations, with women and girls bearing the brunt. The organization has received reports of Taliban members going to homes in Kabul to collect information on residents while extrajudicial killings have been reported in smaller provinces. Shahrzad Mojab, a University of Toronto professor who specializes in threats to women's rights and education, said progress for feminism in Afghanistan has remained limited. She added she isn't convinced by the Taliban's latest promises of reform for women, arguing there's no room for women’s rights under Sharia law. ""Nothing should be framed within the rule of Sharia in the country. And no matter the so-called amnesty the Taliban is promising, this is not going to happen,"" she said. ""Sharia law, by itself, is authoritarian, dictatorial and exclusionary. And it is a game against the rights and well-being of women."" --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... WASHINGTON _ President Joe Biden says he's committed to keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan until every American is evacuated, even if that means maintaining a military presence there beyond his Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawal. In an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on Wednesday, Biden said that the U.S. will do ""everything in our power"" to get Americans and U.S. allies in the nation out before the deadline. Pressed repeatedly on how the administration would help Americans left in the nation after Aug. 31, Biden finally affirmed, ""if there's American citizens left, we're gonna stay till we get them all out."" Up to 15,000 Americans remain in Afghanistan after the Taliban took full control of the nation. The Biden administration has received criticism for the scenes of violence and disorder in recent days as thousands attempted to flee while the Taliban advanced. The turmoil has seen Afghans rush the tarmac at Kabul's airport. In one instance, some apparently fell to their death while clinging to a departing American C-17 transport plane. But during the same interview, Biden suggested there wasn't anything the administration could've done to avoid such chaos. ""The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens,"" he said. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... HONG KONG _ Seven Hong Kong pro-democracy activists pleaded guilty Thursday to organizing and inciting others to take part in an unauthorized assembly held in 2019, local media reported. The seven activists appearing in court included Raphael Wong, the former chairman of the League of Social Democrats political party, and Figo Chan, who led the Civil Human Rights Front, a now disbanded group that organized protests. ""I was protesting based on the principle of civil disobedience. One of the key elements of civil disobedience is to accept the charges. So that is what we are going to do later, to plead guilty,'' Wong said Thursday ahead of the proceedings. ""Another key element is that the people carrying out civil disobedience actions know being jailed is just part of the process,'' he said. ``We are not worried about being jailed. Instead, we hope we can achieve democracy after this process.'' The activists are the latest to appear in court for charges related to 2019 antigovernment protests that roiled the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The protests were sparked by concerns that Beijing was infringing on the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it was handed to Chinese control in 1997. Beijing responded to the protests by imposing a strict new national security law last year that has effectively criminalized much of the opposition to the government and silenced dissent. Most of the city's most prominent activists, including Joshua Wong and Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai, are currently behind bars for taking part in unauthorized protests in 2019. --- On this day in 1942 ... Five-thousand Canadian troops, supported by the British, carried out the disastrous raid on the French port of Dieppe. It was termed a dress rehearsal for the eventual invasion of Nazi-occupied France. For Canada, it was the costliest day of the Second World War. More than 3,300 troops were killed, wounded or captured. Despite the losses, many military strategists regarded the raid as a valuable lesson for later seaborne landings. Two Canadians and one British soldier won Victoria Crosses that day. --- In entertainment ... Rock Demers, one of the most influential figures in Quebec children's cinema, has died at the age of 87. The producer, who made films under his company Les Productions La Fete, helped shape a generation of Canadian family entertainment with titles dubbed in English as ""The Peanut Butter Solution,"" ""The Dog Who Stopped the War"" and the Tommy Tricker adventure film series. In 1963, Demers was one of the co-founders of a film conservatory now known as La Cinematheque quebecoise. He also directed Montreal's International Film Festival for six years starting in 1962, and created the company Faroun Films in 1965, where he stayed until 1978. But it was Demers' move to create Les Productions La Fete in 1980 where he found a singular success in family entertainment with films made under the ""Tales for All"" family film series. ""Bach and Broccoli,'' as it was released in English, was a family drama with a young orphan girl as the central character, while ""The Clean Machine"" told the story of a group of kids who launch a housekeeping service over summer break. Many of the ""Tales for All'' films found audiences outside Quebec on Canadian pay TV and cable showings. ""The Dog Who Stopped the War,'' released in 1984, won the Golden Reel Award at the Genies for being Canada's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office. --- ICYMI ... A New Brunswick soldier accused of serving cannabis-laced cupcakes to a group of Canadian Armed Forces members in 2018 has been found guilty. Bombardier Chelsea Cogswell was convicted Wednesday on eight counts of administering a noxious substance and on one charge of disgraceful conduct. A charge of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline was stayed. She was accused of serving the cupcakes to eight soldiers from a mobile field canteen she operated on July 21, 2018, on 5th Canadian Division Support Base Gagetown in New Brunswick. The soldiers were taking part in a major live-fire training exercise and had to stop firing their guns when they became ill and complained of feeling paranoid and anxious. Military Judge Cmdr. Sandra Sukstorf said she was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Cogswell baked the cupcakes, added cannabis to them and served them to soldiers during the exercise. A sentencing hearing will be held in November. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 19, 2021 Subject: Civil disobedience; Activists; Criminal pleas; Military exercises; Womens rights; Activism; Murders & murder attempts; Human rights; Military personnel"

"2021-08-21","Full text: Concerns raised over apparent PC donation letter TORONTO - Ontario opposition parties are raising concerns over images circulating online of what appears to be a fundraising letter designed to resemble an invoice from the governing Progressive Conservatives. The NDP and Liberals say it could mislead vulnerable residents into thinking they need to pay money to the party. The Progressive Conservatives and Premier Doug Ford's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment. North Bay, Ont., resident Veronica Doyon says a letter from the Progressive Conservatives was delivered to her home and displays the word invoice across the top, with the phrase ""please pay today."" A photo of the letter Doyon shared with The Canadian Press shows a ""balance due"" of $300 for what's described as an ""election readiness fund."" The document describes the payment as a donation in smaller text lower down on the page. The Canadian Press has not been able to confirm the document is authentic. The NDP wrote to Elections Ontario on Wednesday asking for a probe into possible violations of the Elections Act. ""It is deeply concerning that the premier would authorize a fundraising letter created to deliberately confuse or alarm vulnerable individuals into a donation to his campaign,"" NDP ethics critic Taras Natyshak wrote. The Liberals said they intend to contact Ontario Provincial Police out of concern that the apparent Progressive Conservative letter could be considered a scam. ""People are already struggling financially thanks to the pandemic. The Conservatives' apparent attempt to potentially scam vulnerable people out of what little money they have left is despicable,"" Ontario Liberal Party president Brian Johns said in a statement. Johns also called on the Conservatives to return any money they received through similar mailings. OPP spokesman Bill Dickson confirmed that the force received a letter from the Liberal party on Wednesday asking for an investigation into the fundraising documents. ""The OPP will evaluate the request to determine whether a criminal investigation is warranted,"" Dickson said in a statement. Elections Ontario said it does not confirm details of investigations or complaints, but noted fundraising materials don't fall under its area of regulation. ""Elections Ontario regulates provincial elections in Ontario under the Election Act and the Election Finances Act. Neither Act regulates the content of campaign or fundraising materials, or the content of political advertising,"" it said. Doyon said she believes the letter was intended for her parents, who used to live in her current home, because her mother has donated to the Progressive Conservatives. She said she initially posted the photo online to vent her frustration but has since filed a complaint with police over its presentation. ""Maybe I was able to read between the lines and see, no, they're just asking aggressively for a donation, but it doesn't mean that someone else didn't,"" Doyon said in a telephone interview.

"2021-08-21","Full text: Cory Longley has been confirmed as the NDP candidate in Prince George-Peace River-Northern Rockies. Longley was nominated Tuesday night, and says he’s looking to shake things up in what he calls a ""vanity election"" set for Sept. 20. “It’s all about possibilities, and being ready for better. And I’m not seeing that from our current MP,” said Longley. Incumbent Conservative MP Bob Zimmer is running for his fourth term and is also being challenged by Maverick Party candidate Dave Jeffers. Catharine Kendall is listed as the candidate for the Greens, and ran for the party in the 2019 election. A Liberal candidate has not been named. Longley said the election is bad timing and a vanity move by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal government, noting the party is out of touch with the country. “I think it’s a joke. This guy, this prime minister we have right now, did not have to call this election,” said Longley. ""This is a vanity election."" Healthcare and care for all remains top of mind, said Longley, noting he’s concerned residents are not getting their needs met. “One of the biggest issues we face in smaller communities in the North here is the availability of doctors and nurses,” he said. “Why has there not been stronger communication between our MP and the provincial government? Where’s the leadership? I’m not seeing it.” Longley said the failings he sees can be chalked up to a lack of imagination and unwillingness to work together with opposing parties as a coalition. He said minority governments suit Canada best, and hopes the NDP can take the opposition seat again in the House of Commons. “I’m under no illusions. I don’t think the NDP is going to get a majority government this election, all we want is a strong opposition,” he said. “I want people to vote with their conscience, I don’t want people to be wasting their votes on compromised votes.” The nomination process for candidates closes Monday, Aug. 30, according to Elections Canada.

"2021-09-22","Full text: N.S. Liberal leader failed to connect: experts HALIFAX - The bid by Nova Scotia's Liberals for a third consecutive term in power was scuttled by an ineffective campaign and a leader who couldn't gain traction with the public, say political observers. Despite entering the month-long campaign with a big lead in the polls and momentum from their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Liberals suffered a crushing defeat to the Progressive Conservatives led by Tim Houston. The Tories largely rode public dissatisfaction with the province's health-care system to a majority government in Tuesday's election, winning 31 ridings in the newly expanded 55-seat legislature. Liberal Leader Iain Rankin had only been premier for six months before the party chose him to succeed former two-term premier Stephen McNeil during a leadership convention in February. Lori Turnbull, a political scientist at Dalhousie University, said Rankin was put in an untenable position from the start, following on the heels of the ""strong and authoritative"" McNeil. ""Rankin is a 38-year-old man who is quiet and he couldn't fill that space,"" Turnbull said Tuesday night, shortly after the results were announced. ""And I think he struggled to connect with voters during that (pre-election) period."" Turnbull said revelations about Rankin's two drunk driving convictions when he was younger threw the leader and his campaign off. Rankin told reporters shortly before he called the election in July that he had been convicted of impaired driving in 2003 and 2005. And then there was news shortly after the campaign began that party staff had pressured Liberal candidate Robyn Ingraham to drop out because she had previously sold revealing photos of herself on the website OnlyFans. Ingraham also alleged the party had told her to lie and instead cite her mental health issues as the reason for leaving. ""He just never got a narrative going … that really resonated with people,"" Turnbull said. ""And once the campaign started, and Houston and NDP Leader Gary Burrill were able to have equal time, he just lost his lead and he kept losing and here we are."" Barbara Emodi, a political consultant and an ex-NDP communications director under former leader Darrell Dexter, is uncompromising in her view of the Liberal campaign, calling it ""poorly administered."" Emodi said Rankin was over-managed by campaign advisers who seemed ""ill prepared."" ""He seemed to walk over and over again into situations that he was not ready for,"" she said in an interview Wednesday. Emodi noted the Liberals failed to get ahead of the impaired driving issue, and she said the party didn't do itself any favours by limiting media access to Rankin during the final days of the campaign. She said Rankin's campaign couldn't find an answer to counter Houston's strategy of focusing his entire campaign on the problems in the health-care system. The Tory leader constantly highlighted the chronic shortage of family doctors, excessive waits for ambulances and a lack of available mental health supports as issues that needed to be urgently addressed. ""(Houston) took the health-care issue rather astutely, understanding it was his fastest route to election and (the Tories) did a wonderful job of doing that,"" Emodi said. Emodi and Turnbull said the low number of COVID-19 cases in the province during the campaign period exposed Liberal weakness rather than strength. Turnbull said Rankin didn't get the benefit of a COVID-19 bump at the polls because there wasn't the same sense of crisis around that issue compared with the health-care system as a whole. As of Wednesday, the province had a total of 25 active reported cases of COVID-19. Emodi said that in the end, it was Dr. Robert Strang, the province's chief medical officer of health, who proved to be the dominant figure credited by the public — not politicians. She said in the minds of voters, COVID-19 had been removed as a ballot box issue. ""That was what Rankin hoped would be his signature issue, but it was no longer what worried us most,"" Emodi said. Rankin told reporters following Tuesday's results that he was proud of his record and intended to stay on as Liberal leader. ""I made sure that I was true to myself and I ran a positive campaign,"" Rankin said. ""I wouldn't change anything."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 18, 2021.

"2021-08-20","Full text: South Algonquin Township council voted to appoint former Councillor Joe Vermaire’s successor at their Aug. 4 meeting versus having a byelection to fill the now vacant seat. The only councillor that voted in favour of a byelection was Councillor Bongo Bongo, and he explains to Bancroft This Week why he voted for a byelection instead of an appointment. Vermaire resigned from his duties as councillor representing Dickens Ward on July 27. At the next council meeting on Aug. 4, council and staff discussed the best alternatives to filling the vacant council seat. While most of the council voted in favour of appointing Vermaire’s replacement to save money and staff time, as well as acknowledging that the next general election is only 16 months away, Bongo voted against this route, and was in favour of a byelection. Bongo acknowledges that administratively it is more convenient to appoint a new councillor, it is perfectly legal and council is not doing anything wrong against the Municipal Act. He also acknowledges that they are not losing staff time to an extra election at the ¾ mark of this council’s term, and they’re not drawing on their election reserve funds and he wholeheartedly accepts the majority’s decision on this issue. “My concern with appointing a councillor, however, is that it is not technically democratic. The constituency will be getting a new council representative chosen by us, the councillors. This is just my opinion, but it doesn’t feel right to me. It is a matter of principle. I would rather give the power of choice to the people, the voters, not to the current council members in power. Yes, a byelection would use up staff time and financial resources, although from my perspective it would be more democratically responsible. What happens if we choose a councillor that the public disapproves of? Without a doubt, our staff will guide us properly throughout the application process, but ultimately, I think a byelection would alleviate a lot of critical questions regarding fairness,” he says. Although Bongo says he looks forward to the application process, and he’s happy that a new member of the community will join council without the hassle of a byelection, he says he is personally uncomfortable with the power given to him to choose that new colleague. He says that many constituents, from what he has heard, are frustrated that five out of seven positions on council are acclaimed, and in the case of Vermaire’s now vacant seat, once again the people of Dickens ward will not be able to vote for a candidate versus an acclamation or now an appointment. “I would love it if the cycle of ‘no elections’ was broken. Let’s see what happens in 2022. I dream of a flood of applicants, riding on a wave of civic engagement. That to me would be an ideal democracy,” he says. Bongo reiterates that he accepts the majority decision on this matter and he will enthusiastically participate in the application process for council, regardless of the personal beliefs that he’s expressed. “On the plus side, the lack of an election makes the position more attainable to a larger pool of candidates. In fact, if there is anyone out there in South Algonquin that is interested in municipal politics, but you aren’t confident about committing to four years or running a daunting election campaign, this appointment is a fantastic opportunity! We have an amazing staff, an incredible landscape, great people, and a bright future. I wanted to be part of it, and now there’s an opportunity for another community member to experience this special opportunity,” he says. Anyone interested in the vacant council seat is asked to contact Bryan Martin, the CAO/clerk-treasurer, by email at clerk@southalgonquin.ca or by fax at 613-637-5368 by the deadline of Aug. 31 at 3 p.m. Subject: Local elections; Councils"

"2021-08-20","Full text: SDSG – A day after the 2021 federal election was called, local Liberals may have their candidate for the riding of Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry. Retired Cornwall Police Service Sergeant and former Cornwall city councillor Denis Moquin has put his name forward for nomination. “The timing is right,” Moquin told The Leader of why he wanted to run. “I’ve always had in the back of my mind that I wanted to continue to help people, because that’s what I’ve really done all my life.” Moquin retired from the CPS in 2001 and served on city council from 2006-10. He later was executive director of the Eastern Ontario Training Board and now works as a security manager based in Ottawa and lives in Cornwall. He said that one issue he wants to tackle if elected is dealing with the fall out from the pandemic. “If you look around, everyone is so COVID-poor right now. This pandemic has kicked everybody around,” Moquin said. “That’s the biggest concern of mine right now is how are we going to go forward, but its going to take a lot of work.” Outside of the pandemic, an issue Moquin feels that needs more focus on in the local election is middle-class families and farms. “That affordable middle-class and the farming industry, I want to hear from the people who are involved in that and how can we can continue to help,” he explained. While Moquin’s candidacy is not approved yet by the federal Liberal party office, he expects to hear about his approval this week. SDSG Liberal Riding Association chair Claude Poirier said that Moquin met with the riding association Monday night (August 16) and is undergoing “his due diligence to obtain the Liberal nomination.” “The association is pleased that a candidate with a wealth of life experience, such as Denis, is putting his name forward,” Poirier went on to say. Once Moquin has been approved by the national party organization, the riding association will hold a nomination meeting to confirm his candidacy. No other candidates have put their name forward for the Liberal party in SDSG. Subject: Nominations; Local elections; Middle class; Pandemics"

"2021-08-20","Full text: PC incumbent Kim Masland is returning to the legislature for another four years, only this time she’ll be a member of Nova Scotia’s ruling party. Masland quickly jumped out to a massive lead in yesterday’s election and never looked back. After just three polls were counted, she led with 241 votes compared to 47 collected by her next closest competitor, Liberal candidate Susan MacLeod, who had just 47. She finished with 69.81 per cent of the vote or a total of 3,527 votes, well ahead of MacLeod, who finished second with 1,051 votes. The NDP’s Mary Dahr had 321 votes, and Brian Muldoon of the Green Party 153. A total of 8,868 people were registered to vote in Queens; 5,052, or 57.22 per cent of that number, cast their vote. There were 17 ballots rejected and five declined. Masland told LighthouseNOW she didn’t take anything for granted, worked hard for the win and was exhausted. “We hit the ground running five minutes after the election was called,” she said, noting she and her team knocked on more than 5,000 doors during the campaign. “We’re celebrating our hard-earned victory… We had such an amazing team.” According to Masland, the number one issue she heard about on the doorsteps was health care, which was at the forefront of the PCs’ campaign across the province. “People are scared, people are worried about accessing health care and I heard that at every step. People were sharing with me their fear and their personal stories of the health care crisis ware in,” explained Masland. “They’re looking for hope, looking for solutions and we, as a party, put forward our plans over a year ago for Nova Scotians to digest, and they did digest it, and we’re seeing that tonight.” She admitted that being a part of the governing party will be a massive change for her. “I’m ecstatic. When you’re in government this is when you can affect change… “The real work begins tonight, we’ve done our leg work and now it’s time to put the solutions that we have brought forth in to play, to make lives better for Nova Scotians.” Provincially, she said Iain Rankin went into the campaign riding the coattails of former Liberal premier Stephen McNeil, and thought maybe by calling an election in the middle of the summer, and during a pandemic, that people would be disengaged. “You would think that way, but people, Nova Scotians, are engaged and that’s why they turned out in droves at the early polls to make sure their voice was heard in this campaign,” she said. Early on after the polls closed, Elections Nova Scotia’s map of elected and leading candidates was awash with PC blue. Liberal Premier Iain Rankin conceded defeat before it was yet determined whether the PC Leader, Tim Houston, would be leading a majority or minority government. Subject: Provinces; Elections"
"2021-09-22","Full text: A record number of four Black MLAs have been elected to the Nova Scotia legislature. For the Liberals, incumbent Tony Ince and newcomers Angela Simmonds and Ali Duale were elected in the 41st provincial election that saw Tim Houston’s PC’s win a majority government. NDP newcomer Suzy Hansen won in the riding of Halifax Needham. A record total of 11 Black candidates ran for the three major parties in this election. Of those 11, at least three were guaranteed to lose. The Examiner was first to highlight that for the first time in Nova Scotia election history, all the candidates in one riding — the Preston riding — were Black. Last night, Angela Simmonds won the riding against NDP candidate Colter Simmonds and PC candidate Archy Beals. Simmonds replaces Liberal Keith Colwell who announced before the election that he was stepping down. Liberals and PCs ran Black candidates in the riding of Cole Harbour. Incumbent Tony Ince won against close second Darrell Johnson for the PCs. After an unsuccessful bid for the legislature in 2009, Ince was first elected in 2013 when he beat incumbent NDP premier, Darrell Dexter. This will be Ince’s third term in the legislature. He was one of only a handful of Liberal cabinet ministers to reoffer this election. The riding of Halifax Armdale was up for grabs as Liberal cabinet minister Lena Metlege Diab announced she’d be stepping down. Somali-born Liberal candidate Ali Duale won last night in a five-way race. Duale emigrated as a refugee and has worked for the Halifax Regional Fire Department since 2004. And for the NDP, Suzy Hansen won in the riding of Halifax Needham. She replaces former NDP MLA Lisa Roberts, who stepped down to run for the federal NDP in the upcoming federal election. Hansen was previously elected to the Halifax Regional School Board and served until it was dissolved in 2018. Black candidates Lisa Coates for the PCs, Angela Downey for the NDP, and both Donalda MacIsaac in Sackville-Uniacke, and Tamara Tynes Powell for Truro-Bible Hill-Millbrook-Salmon River for the Liberals were unsuccessful in their respective bids last night. Despite winning a majority government, the PCs failed to elect any Black candidates. On July 30, Houston pledged that, if elected, a PC government would modify public schools' social studies curriculum to properly tell African Nova Scotian history. Despite a provincial announcement of an equity assessment for Nova Scotia schools, Black parents and Black educators in the province argue that curriculum aside, Black representation among teachers in Nova Scotia is key. Another key platform issue for Houston was his pledge to address and revamp mental health services in the province. Last October, Houston released a Universal Mental Health Care plan. It will be interesting to see what, if any, direct parallels the PCs make between racism in Nova Scotia and North America and any potential negative effect it has on the mental health of Black people and people of colour. Despite Houston’s Universal Mental Health Care plan being released in the immediate aftermath of the provincial and global Black Lives Matter movements, and in the wake of highly publicized racism toward the Sipekne’katik First Nation, terms like “racism,” “anti-Black racism,” “prejudice,” or “discrimination” do not appear in the document. Around the time that Houston’s mental health plan was released last fall, then-premier, Stephen McNeil announced a hand-picked racial justice “design team” to recommend policy changes to address racism in the justice system. The Examiner’s Stephen Kimber and the province’s first Black Lieutenant Governor, Mayann Francis were critical of the plan. There have been no major media updates on the initiative since fall of 2020. It will be interesting to see how the initiative plays out and what updates will be forthcoming under a Progressive Conservative government.

"2021-08-20","Full text: DURHAM/KAWARTHA: Canadians will be going to the polls for a federal election next month. On Sunday, August 15th, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the decision, at a televised press conference. “I have just had a talk with our Governor-General, and she has accepted my request to dissolve parliament. Canadians will therefore vote on September 20th.” The Prime Minister framed this election as an opportunity to let Canadians decide how the government tackles issues like the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change moving forward. “The decisions your government makes, right now, will define the future your kids and grandkids grow up in. So, in this pivotal, consequential moment, who wouldn’t want a say? Who wouldn’t want a chance to help decide where our country goes from here? Canadians need to choose how we finish the fight against COVID-19 and build back better.” Prime Minister Trudeau added, the COVID-19 pandemic was not discussed during the last federal election, so he feels the government needs to let Canadian residents decide the country's future. “The government and indeed Parliament needs an opportunity to get a mandate from Canadians,” he stressed.

"2021-08-20","Full text: The expected happened on Sunday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Governor General Mary Simon, asking her to dissolve the 43rd Parliament so a federal election could be called. Simon granted that request, and the country was launched into a federal election just prior to Nova Scotia wrapping up a too-close-to-call provincial election. Although the appointment of a new Governor General in July indicated that a federal election was in the cards, despite the government having two years left in its mandate, some federal parties appear to be scrambling to put together a roster of candidates. And federal party leaders, such as the NDP’s Jagmeet Singh and the Conservative’s Erin O’Toole, are opposed to the timing of the election. Singh called the move “selfish” and O’Toole said, “We shouldn’t be rushing to an election.” Trudeau explained his reasoning in a press conference on Aug. 15 – the day of the election call – saying, “The decisions your government makes right now will define the future your kids and grandkids grow up in. So, in this pivotal, consequential moment, who wouldn’t want a say? Who wouldn’t want their chance to help decide where our country goes from here? Canadians need to choose how we finish the fight against COVID-19 and build back better.” The election, Liberals hope, will give them the 170 seats necessary to form a majority government, as they had after Trudeau’s first election win in 2015. With only 155 seats in parliament after the 2019 election, the Liberals are a minority government relying mainly on the support of the NDP to maintain power. Voters will cast their votes in the federal election on Sept. 20. Below is the candidates list for our area, as of the time of publication, for the 2021 federal election. Nominations close at 2 p.m. on Aug. 30.

"2021-08-20","Full text: ST. MARY'S – High-speed Internet is a must for rural communities like St. Mary’s, but residents here will have to wait at least a year before connectivity improves, according to chief administrative officer (CAO) Marvin MacDonald. The long-standing issue became evident during preparations for this week’s provincial election, when voters in the advance poll had to cast paper ballots at the municipal building in Sherbrooke, instead of digital ones. “The Internet speed, in general, is slow and upgrades to our system inside the municipal office will not improve the speed as we are drawing as much Internet speed as available from the service provider at this time,” MacDonald said. In contrast, the connection in others small places in the provincial riding, like Canso and Havre Boucher, has been good enough to serve most public functions, such as digital voting at the advance poll — with connectivity standards set by Elections Nova Scotia. The good news is that improvements are coming. ""Bell is installing fibre optic cable in St. Mary’s through the provincial high-speed funding program and are estimating it will be available in Sherbrooke in Spring 2022,” MacDonald said. ""Until then, we are limited by the speed currently available from the service provider.” Subject: Local elections; Internet"

"2021-08-20","Full text: Climate change will almost certainly be top of mind in the upcoming election after a summer of intense heat waves has left apartment dwellers roasting with no relief and wildfires are sweeping through Ontario and B.C.’s rural communities. A recent landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) foresees a grim future with more of the same — and worse — if we don’t act now. An urgent call to action from the International Energy Agency (IEA) mapped out a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, but Canada has yet to meet an emissions reduction goal, and the Paris Agreement climate targets may soon move out of reach without immediate and massive greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, according to the IPCC report. Here is where the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP, and Green Party stand on climate action. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada’s new GHG reduction target will be 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Whether we will meet this remains unknown, and given the country’s track record, some have doubts. Canada’s emissions jumped 3.3 per cent from 2016 to 2019, according to a report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the Corporate Mapping Project, the Parkland Institute, Stand.earth, West Coast Environmental Law, and 350.org. Trudeau’s new target fails to keep pace with the Biden administration’s commitment to a 50 to 52 per cent reduction by 2030. Earlier this year, a Supreme Court ruling put an end to legal challenges from the governments of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Ontario that the federal government’s carbon pricing law encroached on provincial autonomy and was unconstitutional. After the release of Erin O’Toole’s climate plan in mid-April, all four major federal parties now support some variation of carbon pricing. After the Supreme Court ruled the implementation of the Liberals’ carbon tax was constitutional, MP Laurel Collins, the NDP critic for environment and climate change, issued a statement saying, “The Liberals have staked their entire climate plan on the carbon tax,” which “isn’t nearly enough.” The statement decries the Liberals’ ongoing support of big polluters and calls for immediate investment in transit, energy-efficient homes and buildings, and clean energy. When Trudeau announced Canada’s new target of 40 to 45 per cent emissions reductions, federal Green Party Leader Annamie Paul told Canada’s National Observer those “unambitious targets” will be impossible to meet if the federal government continues to subsidize the fossil fuel industry and greenlight projects like the three offshore drilling projects recently approved off the coast of St. John’s, N.L. The Green Party has not yet released its full election platform — this article will be updated during the election campaign to reflect any new commitments as they are made — but based on previous plans and recent comments and news releases, this is where things stand.

"2021-08-20","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Aug. 18 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 18, 2021... What we are watching in Canada ... The election spotlight could shift today to Canada's pandemic-ravaged economy and debt-laden federal finances as Statistics Canada reveals its consumer price index for July. The annual pace of inflation was 3.1 per cent in June, down from 3.6 per cent in May when the consumer price index posted its largest yearly increase in a decade. The inflation rate has exceeded the Bank of Canada's target of two per cent since April and some economists expect it to creep as high as 3.9 per cent in the fall. Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem has argued that price increases are temporary — the result of supply chain disruptions during COVID-19 lockdowns — and that allowing inflation to remain temporarily high will help the economy rebound from the pandemic-induced recession. He has said Canadians can be confident that the central bank will keep the cost of living under control as the economy reopens, even as it maintains its record-low benchmark interest rate of 0.25 per cent. However, some economists believe inflation could spike higher and last longer than Macklem suggests. And persistently high inflation would put pressure on the bank to increase interest rates, which would make it exponentially more costly for the federal government to carry its staggering debt load. The 2021 budget forecast that the debt will double to $1.4 trillion by 2026. --- Also this ... Nova Scotia's Progressive Conservatives surged to an upset election win Tuesday over the governing Liberals after capitalizing on their main opponent's early stumbles and promising a big-spending fix to the troubled health system. During the campaign, Tory Leader Tim Houston unveiled a left-leaning platform that promised hundreds of millions of dollars in the first year of the party's mandate to increase the number of family doctors, bolster the mental health system and create more nursing home beds. In his victory speech, Houston said the public responded to the solutions he put forward and decided against simply rewarding the Liberals for competently handling the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Regardless of what the polls may say, what we know is that if you provide real solutions to real problems then the voters will pay attention,'' the 51-year-old chartered accountant told the crowd. ""Not just here in Nova Scotia, but in all of Canada, we proved that just because there is a pandemic doesn't mean government gets a free pass. Houston's party has also become the first to unseat a government in Canada since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other elections that have taken place during the course of the health crisis _ in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Yukon and Saskatchewan _ all saw incumbent leaders remain in power. Liberal Leader Iain Rankin told supporters in Halifax he didn't have immediate plans to step down, despite the resounding defeat. --- And this ... The senior military officer who oversaw Canada's vaccine rollout campaign is poised to be charged with one count of sexual assault, though one of his lawyers is raising questions about the timing of that decision in relation to the federal election. Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin is scheduled to present himself to police in Gatineau, Que., this morning after being told a warrant had been issued for his arrest in relation to an alleged incident dating back to early 1988. Fortin, who previously served in Afghanistan and commanded NATO troops in Iraq before leading Canada's COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort, is expected to address reporters after he appears before police.

GRIZZLY FLATS, Calif. _ Northern California wildfires that incinerated two mountain communities continued marching through the Sierra Nevada on Wednesday while a utility purposely blacked out as many as 51,000 customers to prevent new blazes. Two weeks after the Dixie Fire destroyed most of the Gold Rush-era town of Greenville, the Caldor Fire a few miles southeast exploded through tinder-dry trees and ravaged Grizzly Flats, a forest community of around 1,200 people. Fire officials estimated that at least 50 homes had burned in the area since the fire erupted Saturday and two people were hospitalized with serious injuries. Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency in El Dorado County, where authorities were considering closing the entire El Dorado National Forest. Both fires grew by tens of thousands of acres from Monday afternoon through Tuesday, torching trees and burning up brush left tinder-dry by high temperatures, low humidity and drought. Afternoon gusts drove the flames. Late Tuesday, Pacific Gas & Electric said it has begun shutting off power to as many as 51,000 customers in 18 Northern California counties to prevent wildfires for the first time since last year's historically bad fire season. The utility said the shutoffs were focused in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the North Coast, the North Valley and the North Bay mountains and could last into Wednesday afternoon. Climate change has made the U.S. West warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... VATICAN CITY _ Pope Francis is adding his voice to a campaign to overcome vaccine skepticism, issuing a public service announcement insisting that vaccines are safe, effective and an ""act of love."" The video message released Wednesday is aimed at a global audience but directed particularly at the Americas. It features six cardinals and archbishops from North, Central and South America as well as the Argentine-born pope. It was produced by the Vatican and the Ad Council, which has produced a series of pro-vaccine ads in a bid to get more people vaccinated. In his comments, Francis said: ""Being vaccinated with vaccines authorized by the competent authorities is an act of love. And contributing to ensure the majority of people are vaccinated is an act of love."""
"2021-08-20","Full text: Fortin lawyer questions sex assault charge timing OTTAWA - The senior military officer who oversaw Canada’s vaccine rollout campaign is poised to be charged with one count of sexual assault, though one of his lawyers is raising questions about the timing of that decision in relation to the federal election. Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin is scheduled to present himself to police in Gatineau, Que., this morning after being told a warrant had been issued for his arrest in relation to an alleged incident dating back to early 1988, lawyer Natalia Rodriguez told The Canadian Press. Fortin, who previously served in Afghanistan and commanded NATO troops in Iraq before leading Canada’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort, is expected to address reporters after he appears before police. The military officer was removed from the vaccine rollout on May 14, five days before the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service referred a sexual misconduct investigation to the Quebec prosecution service to determine whether criminal charges should be laid. Fortin, through his lawyers, has denied any wrongdoing and says his reputation has been badly damaged by the allegation. He is now fighting in Federal Court for reinstatement to his previous position at the Public Health Agency of Canada, or an equivalent post. The military officer and his legal team were surprised by the decision to lay charges, said Rodriguez, who is representing Fortin in his Federal Court application and is not a member of his criminal team. She added Fortin’s legal counsel have so far been provided little information about the allegation against their client, “so he doesn’t know what this is about at all.” Rodriguez went on to question the timing of the charge against Fortin, which comes days after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau launched an election. The Liberals have been criticized for months for not doing more to address sexual misconduct in the Canadian military. Fortin's lawyers have argued in Federal Court that the decision to remove their client was unreasonable, lacked procedural fairness and involved improper political interference in the military chain of command by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Health Minister Patty Hajdu, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and clerk of the Privy Council. The government is required to respond to those allegations on Sept. 17, three days before voters head to the polls. “The timing of the charge raises questions,” Rodriguez said. “We’ll be looking at answering those questions and making sure this is not politically motivated and that it is above board. As Maj.-Gen. Fortin’s lawyers, we have a duty to ensure that there’s been no improper political interference in this case.” Defence Department spokeswoman Jessica Lamirande declined to comment on Tuesday night, saying in an email: “As the matter is moving through the legal process, it would be inappropriate for us to provide any further comment.”"
"2021-08-20","Full text: GUYSBOROUGH – A month is a long time in politics. When Premier Iain Rankin called a provincial election last month, with more than a year left in his government’s mandate, many pundits thought a Liberal victory was assured. As votes were counted into the night on Aug. 17, that assumption was seen to be in error. The first hint that things weren’t going according to plan for the Liberals was the lead PC candidate Kent Smith was taking over Liberal incumbent and Speaker of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly Kevin Murphy in the riding of Eastern Shore. Since 1970, that riding has elected a government representative, earning the distinction of predicting the trend in Nova Scotia elections. As the night drew on, the PCs painted most of the electoral map – except for urban ridings and a few rural ridings in the Annapolis Valley and South Shore – blue. In the riding of Guysborough-Tracadie, PC candidate Greg Morrow started the night strong and kept pulling ahead of incumbent Liberal Lloyd Hines as more votes were counted. When more than half of all possible votes (7,767) were counted at 11 p.m. on election night, Morrow was ahead by 1,600 votes. Morrow spoke to The Journal when 25 of 27 polls had reported, clearly defining him as the new MLA for the Guysborough-Tracadie riding. Morrow said that he and his team worked hard during the election, adding, “It really starts with the team, and we had a great team … I heard the only way to beat an incumbent is to out work them.” And, according to poll results, the electorate rewarded his effort. When asked what he had learned during the campaign, Morrow said he saw that people really appreciated it when you came to meet them at their door, “To ask them what their concerns are … I had one guy say to me, ‘The UPS guy can’t even find me.’ So, I took that with a bit of pride. We made pretty sure to get to every back road and side road across the biggest riding in the province and we’re pretty proud of that.” Looking ahead, Morrow said he sees a lot of hard work in the months to come. “I spoke to thousands of people on the doorstep; there are a lot of different concerns and issues across the province – healthcare is number one and we have some work to do there. As a party we’ve been up front with people. We’ve said fixing healthcare isn’t going to be cheap and it isn’t going to happen overnight, but we’re willing to invest because Nova Scotians are worth it.” As the blue wave swept across the province, handing the PC party a majority and party Leader Tim Houston a seat in the premier’s chair, Morrow said, “Within the party there was a belief that we focused on healthcare and that was what people were hearing on the doorstep, people responded to that. The polls had us down … at the beginning of this thing, we were down 28 points, tonight we’ve come back to win a government. That’s very exciting. It just goes to show that hard work pays off.” Subject: Provincial elections; Election results"

"2021-09-22","Full text: Tories surge to surprising majority win in N.S. HALIFAX - Nova Scotia's Progressive Conservatives surged to an upset election win Tuesday over the governing Liberals after capitalizing on their main opponent's early stumbles and promising a big-spending fix to the troubled health system. During the campaign, Tory Leader Tim Houston unveiled a left-leaning platform that promised hundreds of millions of dollars in the first year of the party's mandate to increase the number of family doctors, bolster the mental health system and create more nursing home beds. The message caught on with voters. With five electoral ridings left to call late Tuesday night, the Progressive Conservatives were elected or leading in 31 ridings, with 28 seats needed for a majority in the newly expanded 55-seat legislature. At dissolution the party had 17 seats. A beaming Houston, who won the leadership three years ago, entered his party headquarters at a sports facility near New Glasgow, N.S., pounding fists with his supporters to the tune of John Fogerty's ""Centerfield."" In his victory speech, Houston said the public responded to the solutions he put forward and decided against simply rewarding the Liberals for competently handling the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Regardless of what the polls may say, what we know is that if you provide real solutions to real problems then the voters will pay attention,"" the 51-year-old chartered accountant told the crowd. ""Not just here in Nova Scotia, but in all of Canada, we proved that just because there is a pandemic doesn't mean government gets a free pass."" As the victory celebrations unfolded, party stalwarts spoke of a huge turnaround from the beginning of the race. ""We're ecstatic,"" Tara Miller said with a laugh. Miller, a co-chair with the Tory campaign, said the party was able to pull itself up in the polls from far behind earlier this summer. Houston's party has also become the first to unseat a government in Canada since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other elections that have taken place during the course of the health crisis — in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Yukon and Saskatchewan — all saw incumbent leaders remain in power. Liberal Leader Iain Rankin told supporters in Halifax he didn't have immediate plans to step down, despite the resounding defeat. Late Tuesday night, results indicated his party was leading or elected in 17 ridings, down from 24. ""I will continue to lead this party,"" he said in his concession speech. ""I will continue to do whatever I can do to fight for every single Nova Scotian to make sure that we have a voice,"" said the 38-year-old, who had been Canada's youngest premier. Voters toppled a number of longtime Liberal cabinet ministers in party strongholds, including the ministers of Health and Transportation, and they brought the Tories back into office for the first time since 2009. The NDP, led by United Church Minister Gary Burrill, had five seats at dissolution, and four hours after the polls closed party members were elected or leading in six ridings. Burrill campaigned on a traditionally progressive platform that called for a $15 minimum wage, 10 paid sick days for all workers and rent control. ""We in our party have placed these issues of real people's real lives at the centre of the discourse of our campaign,"" the 66-year-old leader told supporters Tuesday night. Before the 32-day race started, the governing Liberals were leading in the polls, having won kudos for their handling of the pandemic. But the party stumbled just before the election campaign began. Rankin revealed in July he had been convicted of impaired driving as a young man in 2003 and 2005. He provided few details about the second conviction, which was dismissed in court. The lack of disclosure surrounding the second case prompted a series of unflattering media reports. And in the first week of the campaign, the Liberals faced more negative headlines after a female Liberal candidate alleged party staff had pressured her to drop out of the race because she had previously sold revealing photos of herself on the website OnlyFans. Robyn Ingraham said the party had told her to cite her mental health issues as the reason for her departure on the first day of the campaign, which she did in writing before going public with her version of events. As the campaign neared the midway point, Rankin was kept on the defensive during a leaders debate that saw Houston and Burrill taking shots at the premier over his record on health care. In particular, Houston criticized the premier for failing to deal with a chronic physician shortage that has left more than 70,000 Nova Scotians without a family doctor. Houston has said a Tory government would spend $553 million during its first year in office to fulfil campaign promises, mostly for improving health care. Rankin, who was elected to lead the Liberal party in February, argued that his party's planned investments in health care were sensible. ""What we don't need is a competition on who can throw the most money at an issue,"" the former business manager said during the debate. Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin was the sole Independent elected. The former Tory was kicked out of caucus for her part in a COVID-19 protest that shut down the Trans-Canada Highway in June of this year, but she nonetheless managed to defeat former Liberal MP Bill Casey, who came out of retirement to attempt to challenge for the seat. The election featured the return of the protected Acadian ridings of Richmond, Argyle and Clare as well as the predominantly African Nova Scotian riding of Preston, raising the total number of seats to 55.

"2021-08-20","Full text: It's off to the hustings for federal election candidates in northeast B.C. As of Tuesday, Elections Canada said there were no candidates officially confirmed in the Prince George-Peace River-Northern Rockies, however, incumbent Conservative MP Bob Zimmer and Maverick Party challenger Dave Jeffers have both hit the ground running. Zimmer said the timing of the snap election, set for Sept. 20, was inappropriate in light of the extreme wildfire season in B.C. ""A lot of people have said it's a bad time to call an election, especially with concerns from wildfire folks,"" said Zimmer. ""In our region many are preoccupied with that, it's a big concern. But I've also heard from constituents that they're tired of the current Prime Minister and the government that's there and they're ready for a change."" Jeffers agreed, noting the COVID-19 pandemic is not over. ""I think it's horrible. I think there's a lot of people who are legitimately worried and concerned about going to the polls or going anywhere,"" said Jeffers. ""Maybe not as much in this riding, but the federal election doesn't revolve around this riding — it's everybody."" Zimmer was first elected in 2011, and is seeking a fourth term after retaining his seat in the 2015 and 2019 elections. Advocating for resource industries remains a core pillar of the Conservative party, Zimmer said, noting he’s heard from many in the region who are worried about economic uncertainty and lack of investor confidence in the country. ""We're doing what we've always done, being supporters of the firearms community here, supporters of the outdoor community. We've been doing a lot of work on the arbitrary closures and trying to be a voice for them in Ottawa,"" said Zimmer. ""One of the biggest issues in our riding is the natural resource sector, whether it's forestry or oil and gas, just to have some confidence that a government is looking out for their best interests."" The Maverick Party was formally launched last September, formerly called Wexit, to represent Western Canadian interests in Ottawa. Former Peace region MP Jay Hill is the party’s interim leader, and Jeffers says carving a new and better deal for Western Canada remains at the top of his party's mind. ""Environment and energy are the two key issues that I've spoken about, those will be front and centre for the campaign,"" said Jeffers. ""Those are two personal issues for me, resource development and having been in resource development for the last 25 years."" Jeffers said he wants to see a revision of equalization payments from Western provinces to the East, and a reversal of the carbon tax. ""Either repealing it or rewriting to make it more fair,"" said Jeffers of the payments from B.C. and Alberta. ""What we're looking for is western province autonomy, so we can have united front in the house of commons, so we can be treated fairly. Maybe for the first time since confederacy."" The Liberals and NDP have not formally listed candidates on their websites. Dawson Creek resident Cory Longley announced his intention to run in June, and said Tuesday that his party was finalizing its nominations later that night. ""My BC NDP campaign in Peace River South last Fall further ignited my lifelong passion for progressive politics, and I believe wholeheartedly in the NDP's goals and values,"" Longley said in a post announcing his intentions earlier this summer. ""Some may say this is a challenging riding, but I see an area that deserves better than what 49 years of conservative representatives have brought to the table."" Catharine Kendall is listed as the candidate for the Greens. Kendall is a community development consultant based in Prince George, and ran for the party in the 2019 election. Kendall could not be reached for comment. The nomination process for candidates closes Monday, Aug. 30, according to Elections Canada.

"2021-08-20","Full text: Consequences for unvaxxed federal workers: Trudeau OTTAWA - Public servants who can get vaccinated and choose not to will face ""consequences"" for their decision if the Liberals are returned to power, Justin Trudeau said Tuesday as the issue of vaccine mandates exploded on the campaign trail. Just 24 hours earlier the Liberal leader had said his government was looking over how to implement an election-eve push to force federal workers to get their COVID-19 shots. He stopped short at the time in saying whether anyone should be fired, as the New Democrats had suggested as the ultimate punishment for federal workers who opt not to be immunized. During a campaign stop in Markham, Ont., Trudeau said a Liberal government would mete out ""consequences"" for unvaccinated public servants. ""The bottom line is, if anyone who doesn't have a legitimate medical reason for not getting fully vaccinatedor chooses to not get vaccinated, there will be consequences,"" Trudeau said. What those consequences are, Trudeau didn't say. The latest federal figures show that 73 per cent of those 12 and up who are eligible are fully vaccinated. While the pace of second doses has declined over the past few weeks, emotions around the issue have risen along the campaign trail. Trudeau was confronted by anti-mask protesters for the second day in a row Tuesday, this time during a whistle stop in Aurora, Ont. ""Are you here to unmask our children,"" one of them yelled, as he walked down the street, encircled by a heavy police presence. Another yelled ""you’re killing our children!"" Trudeau, wearing his usual black face mask, took a step toward the woman with the megaphone and yelled, ""please get vaccinated."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, speaking in Toronto, said vaccines were critical, noting he publicly posted about getting his shot months after testing positive for COVID-19. He added that in some cases, rapid tests, masks and other measures could be used as protection against the virus and its variants. ""We need to get people vaccinated, but also have a plan in cases where they're not,"" O'Toole told reporters after outlining a pledge for a GST holiday to prod spending. ""Our plan is balanced, it's reasonable and … before they pulled it off the internet, it seemed like it was actually what the civil service was recommending to the prime minister."" The ""it"" was a note posted over the weekend by the government's chief human resources officer that said alternative measures, like testing and screening, will need to be considered for public servants not wanting to get vaccinated. It was quickly pulled Monday night with the Treasury Board saying it contained erroneous information. Despite Trudeau saying, the letter didn't reflect his government's policies, and pulled down by public servants, the Conservatives wrote to the clerk of Privy Council on Tuesday, asking for an investigation into what happened. Rules during election periods, laid down from the clerk who heads the federal bureaucracy, are designed to prevent public servants from being pulled into the partisan fray. In the letter to the clerk, the Conservatives charged the ""caretaker convention"" had been breached with the letter being suddenly dropped from the government's website, and that a probe was necessary to find ""the persons involved and the exact directions and communications in which those individuals engaged."" The party asked for results before election day on Sept. 20. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he worried that the debate about vaccines in a hyper-partisan campaign environment, could politicize the issue of getting vaccinated — something which he, Trudeau and O'Toole agreed was necessary for ending the pandemic. But he was also clear in his support for a vaccine mandate for federal workers who deliver services for Canadians, some of whom may not be able to be vaccinated for medical reasons. ""If someone doesn't get vaccinated in places that we know it would put people at risk … then they would not be able to continue working in those places,"" Singh said in Coquitlam, B.C., where he outlined his party's proposal to create jobs. ""People have the choice not to get vaccinated, but it is essential that we set up every step possible to encourage people to be vaccinated."" The Public Service Alliance of Canada, which represents 215,000 federal public service workers, said in a news release Tuesday the political party leaders have made ""concerning statements"" about disciplining or terminating workers. ""PSAC has been in consultation with the federal government on its vaccination proposal, and our position is clear: employees with a valid medical reason for being unvaccinated, or for reasons protected by human rights legislation, must be offered a formal accommodation under the law."""
"2021-09-22","Full text: Feds drop court quest to keep lab docs under wraps OTTAWA - The Trudeau government is dropping its quest to have a court prohibit the disclosure of documents related to the firing of two scientists at Canada's highest-security laboratory. It served the Federal Court with a notice of discontinuance late Tuesday afternoon. In so doing, it's avoiding a legal showdown over the long-standing principle that the House of Commons is supreme and has unfettered power to demand the production of any documents it sees fit, no matter how sensitive and regardless of privacy or national security laws. Opposition parties joined forces earlier this year to pass a Commons order demanding that the Public Health Agency of Canada turn over all unredacted documents related to the firing of scientists Xiangguo Qiu and her husband, Keding Cheng. The pair were escorted out of Winnipeg’s National Microbiology Laboratory in July 2019 and subsequently fired last January. The government applied to the Federal Court of Canada in June to prevent release of the documents, which it maintained would be injurious to international relations or to national defence or national security. However, the Commons order to produce the documents, along with all other business before the chamber, was terminated when Parliament was dissolved Sunday for a federal election. Consequently, Justice Department spokesperson Melissa Gruber said Tuesday that ""no purpose would be served"" by continuing the court case. Pursuing the case would have put Liberal MP Anthony Rota in an awkward position as he campaigns for re-election in the northern Ontario riding of Nipissing-Timiskaming. As Speaker of the House of Commons, he was the named respondent in the court case. He had pledged to fight the Liberal government's court application. Indeed, in a recent submission to the court, Rota asked it to dismiss the case, arguing that the courts have no jurisdiction to review the exercise of parliamentary privilege to send for the “persons, papers and records” deemed necessary. “This constitutionally entrenched power is fundamental to our system of parliamentary democracy, and to Parliament’s critical role in acting as the ‘grand inquest of the nation’ and in holding the executive branch of government to account,” Rota said in a notice of motion. The executive and the judicial branches do not have the jurisdiction to question, overrule, modify, control or review the exercise of this privilege by the House, he added. Gruber said the Speaker’s motion to strike the case is now ""unnecessary."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole had requested the court's permission to intervene in the proceedings. Abandoning the case is ""another attempt by Justin Trudeau to cover up the truth about the Winnipeg lab documents,"" said Mathew Clancy, a spokesman for the Conservative election campaign. The decision to drop the case brings an inconclusive end to the months-long power struggle between opposition parties and Public Health Agency of Canada head Iain Stewart. Opposition MPs repeatedly asserted the right of the Commons and its committees to order the production of any documents they please, while Stewart steadfastly argued that he was prevented by law from releasing material that could violate privacy or national security laws. The battle culminated in June with Stewart being hauled before the bar of the Commons to be reprimanded by Rota over his repeated refusal to provide the unredacted documents to MPs on the Canada-China relations committee. He was the first non-MP to be subjected to such a procedure in more than a century. Stewart had been ordered to turn over the documents to the parliamentary law clerk at that time, but he did not. Instead, he wrote to the attorney general, David Lametti, informing him that he was being ordered to divulge potentially injurious information contrary to the Canada Evidence Act. In accordance with the act, Lametti subsequently said the decision to apply to the court to prevent disclosure of the documents was made by justice officials. The Commons order for documents also included documents related to the transfer, overseen by Qiu, of deadly Ebola and Henipah viruses to China's Wuhan Institute of Virology in March 2019. Stewart had said the virus transfer had nothing to do with the subsequent firings. He'd also said there was no connection to COVID-19, a coronavirus that first appeared in China's Wuhan province and which some believe may have been released accidentally by the virology institute, triggering a global pandemic. Nevertheless, opposition parties continued to suspect a link and remained determined to see the unredacted documents. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 17, 2021.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Cooper Price was meant to be old enough to vote in the next federal election, but the young climate activist will have to sit out another one after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau called a snap election on the weekend. Price, who is starting Grade 12, is nevertheless adamant the campaign should involve politicians stating what they will do to avert the worst environmental impacts of our industrial activity, which he hopes includes an immediate end to fossil fuel subsidies and the start of a phase out of the industry. “If the leaders, particularly Trudeau, don't make this focused on climate change, there's going to be a lot of young voters that are going to be completely disenchanted with their party,” said Price, who has played a leading role in Toronto’s school strike movement. “If this isn't a climate election, then I really don't know what could be, given everything that's been happening,” he said, referring to a string of recent heat waves, wildfires and other extreme weather, as well as the latest dire warning from the world’s scientific community. Trudeau, for his part, made clear in his pitch for a majority government after two years of minority rule that “the decisions your government makes right now will define the future your kids and grandkids will grow up in.” Younger voters at this early stage are as interested in the campaign as those aged between 30 and 59, while those 60-plus are much more likely to be into it, according to polling from Abacus Data. For Allie Rougeot, another climate activist, politics should be less about lofty words and long-term targets and more about what government plans to do to help real people deal with an ongoing crisis. “What I've not seen at all is an acknowledgment of what it's going to take from governments to act on climate,” she said, adding a climate lens should be applied to all policies. “I'd like to see a whole-of-economy, whole-of-country approach where every time we do something, we understand it's going to have a climate risk or a climate benefit,” she said. Younger people, who account for around 40 per cent of the population, will also want to hear about how a COVID-19 recovery will help them secure stable, well-paying jobs, and how to deal with rising affordability challenges. They were hit hard by job losses when the pandemic first hit, and have taken the longest to get back into the workforce, with many young people working in industries impacted by public health restrictions. “We’re worried about a bleak future, characterized by the gig economy, massive student debt loads, and unaffordable housing,” said Bronwyn Heerspink, a regional director for Future Majority, a youth advocacy group seeking to influence post-pandemic policy. Future Majority had said after the initial lockdown that it wanted those in power to know young people want better provision of mental health services and a guaranteed minimum income, more affordable post-secondary education and more racial justice, after two months of surveying its 52,000 members and other youth groups. Sophia Koukoulas, manager of communications and stakeholder relations at youth employment network First Work, said the uncertainty of youth employment can create financial insecurity and poor mental health. “More than anything, young people want to be listened to in this election, not left behind in policy discussions,” she said, noting that their focus extends beyond a stable environment. “Young people today are concerned about the nature of work and well-being, with strong attention to equity for barriered populations,” she said. “This means a renewed focus for young people on the transition from school to employment, so that their career pathways are not limited to the confines of attaining post-secondary education.” Morgan Sharp / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer Subject: Youth employment; Mental health; Climate change; Pandemics; COVID-19"

"2021-09-22","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Aug. 17 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 17, 2021. What we are watching in Canada ... New survey results suggest Justin Trudeau's Liberals were clinging to a five-point lead on the eve of the federal election campaign. Thirty-five per cent of decided voters who took part expressed support for the Liberals, 30 per cent for the Conservatives and 20 per cent the NDP. Seven per cent would vote for the Bloc Québécois, which is fielding candidates only in Quebec, while five per cent supported the Greens and two per cent the People's Party of Canada. The online survey of 2,007 Canadians, conducted Aug. 13 to 15 by Leger in collaboration with The Canadian Press, cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered truly random samples. Trudeau quickly framed the election that began Sunday as a referendum on the party most able to guide the country through the months and years after COVID-19 subsides. The 36-day campaign, the shortest allowed under the election law, concludes Sept. 20. --- Also this ... Nova Scotians are heading to the polls today following a midsummer election campaign that was waged as the province started to emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. The incumbent Liberals, led by 38-year-old Iain Rankin, tried to capitalize on post-pandemic optimism while preaching fiscal conservatism. His party, which he took over after replacing Stephen McNeil as leader in February, has been in power since 2013. The Progressive Conservatives, led by chartered accountant Tim Houston, tried to set themselves apart by unveiling a big-spending platform focused on improving the health-care system. The New Democrats, led by United Church minister Gary Burrill, campaigned on a traditionally progressive platform that called for a $15 minimum wage, 10 paid sick days for all workers and rent control. A total of 28 seats are needed to secure a majority in the province's newly expanded 55-seat legislature. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... WASHINGTON _ A defiant President Joe Biden rejected blame Monday for chaotic scenes of Afghans clinging to U.S. military planes in Kabul in a desperate bid to flee their home country after the Taliban's easy victory over an Afghan military that America and NATO allies had spent two decades trying to build. At the White House, Biden called the anguish of trapped Afghan civilians ""gut-wrenching"" and conceded the Taliban had achieved a much faster takeover of the country than his administration had expected. The U.S. rushed in troops to protect its own evacuating diplomats and others at the Kabul airport. But the president expressed no second thoughts about his decision to stick by the U.S. commitment, formulated during the Trump administration, to end America's longest war, no matter what. ""I stand squarely behind my decision"" to finally withdraw U.S. combat forces, Biden said, while acknowledging the Afghan collapse played out far more quickly than the most pessimistic public forecasts of his administration. ""This did unfold more quickly than we anticipated,"" he said. Despite declaring ""the buck stops with me,"" Biden placed almost all blame on Afghans for the shockingly rapid Taliban conquest. His grim comments were his first in person to the world since the biggest foreign policy crisis of his still-young presidency. Emboldened by the U.S. withdrawal, Taliban fighters swept across the country last week and captured the capital, Kabul, on Sunday, sending U.S.-backed Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fleeing the country. Biden said he had warned Ghani _ who was appointed Afghanistan's president in a U.S.-negotiated agreement _ to be prepared to fight a civil war with the Taliban after U.S. forces left. ""They failed to do any of that,"" he said. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban announced Tuesday an ""amnesty"" across Afghanistan and urged women to join its government, trying to calm nerves across a nervous capital city that only the day before saw chaos at its airport as people tried to flee their rule. The comments by Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban's cultural commission, represent the first comments on governance from a federal level across the country after their blitz across the country. While there were no major reports of abuses or fighting in Kabul, many residents have stayed home and remain fearful after the insurgents' takeover saw prisons emptied and armories looted. Older generations remember their ultraconservative Islamic views, which included stonings, amputations and public executions during their rule before the U.S-led invasion that followed the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. ""The Islamic Emirate doesn't want women to be victims"" Samangani said, using the militants' term for Afghanistan. ""They should be in government structure according to Shariah law."" He added: ""The structure of government is not fully clear, but based on experience, there should be a fully Islamic leadership and all sides should join."""

"2021-08-19","Full text: Leaders make final appeals in N.S. campaign HALIFAX - Nova Scotia's three main party leaders rallied supporters and made final pitches to voters on the eve of Tuesday's provincial election. A contest that many thought would be a foregone conclusion for the incumbent Liberals has drawn tighter over the last two weeks, and the result could come down to party organization in crucial ridings. This time around, voters will cast ballots in 55 ridings after the legislature was expanded by four seats following a 2019 redistribution. Liberal Leader Iain Rankin struck a confident tone as he addressed supporters Monday at a suburban Halifax shopping mall in the Bedford riding of deputy premier Kelly Regan. He was flanked by nine Halifax-area candidates. ""Nova Scotia has arrived at this very important moment, a moment to choose a prosperous path to a bright future,"" Rankin said. The 38-year-old, who succeeded Stephen McNeil as premier at a party convention in February, said the upcoming vote is also about ""proven leadership."" ""We have not been afraid to make tough decisions to keep Nova Scotians and our economy safe and healthy,"" he said. Rankin has stressed an optimistic but tight-fisted approach to the province's finances and has argued that targeted spending in areas such as health care, education and skills training are the best way to bolster the economy as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. He told reporters that he was satisfied with his campaign and wouldn't have done anything differently. Rankin also took a last swipe at Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Houston, who has stressed his progressive credentials during the campaign. ""He's continuously criticized our approach to handling the pandemic … that's not a progressive style of politics,"" the Liberal leader said. Houston, meanwhile, appeared buoyant about his prospects on Monday as he addressed supporters at Halifax-area strip mall parking lot. ""Thirty days ago, the polls said we wouldn't have a chance — turns out they were wrong,"" Houston said to applause. ""With one day to go, I want you to help us send a clear message to the voters of Nova Scotia. Their vote will make a difference."" Houston said his campaign hit on a winning message by almost exclusively focusing on the need to invest massively in the health-care system. ""Nova Scotians told me that health care was their priority,"" he said. ""That's why we are focusing on health care, it's not a (campaign) sound bite."" A recent poll from Narrative Research indicated the gap in support between the Nova Scotia Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives had narrowed. The polling agency said that in May, the Liberals were at 52 per cent support compared to 24 per cent for the Tories and 19 per cent for the NDP. But new polling, conducted between July 27 and Aug. 9, put the Liberals at 40 per cent, the Tories at 31 per cent and the NDP at 27 per cent. Support for the Liberals was at its lowest point in the past year while the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP had gained momentum. Houston, who appeared with 10 Halifax-area candidates, told reporters he believes the party will do well across the city's crucial 21 ridings and in other areas of the province. ""I'm really encouraged by the early voting numbers,"" he said. ""That to me sends the message that people want change."" According to Elections Nova Scotia, a total of 166,403 early votes had been cast as of Friday, compared to 112,944 at the same point in the 2017 provincial election. Elsewhere in Halifax, NDP Leader Gary Burrill appeared at an elementary school with several of the people he met during the campaign. Burrill has staged daily events where he chatted with voters about issues affecting their lives, such as health care, affordable housing and rent control. ""I want to be very clear: if either Iain Rankin or Tim Houston are elected these things will not happen,"" Burrill said in a news release. ""But real people need them to happen, and they can happen."""

"2021-08-19","Full text: TSX dips slightly, U.S. markets creep higher TORONTO - North American stock markets were flat Monday as investors stayed the course in spite of the weekend's turbulence in Afghanistan and the kick-off of a Canadian federal election campaign. Craig Fehr, investment strategist with Edward Jones, said Monday was characterized by low trading volumes and little volatility in equity pricing. This came in spite of ongoing geopolitical turmoil in Afghanistan as the Taliban seized Kabul, as well as domestic uncertainty brought about by Sunday’s announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the country will go to the polls Sept. 20. “Those are typically some events that can cause some knee jerk reaction in the market, and yet, equities haven’t reacted sharply,” Fehr said. “It was a very, very quiet day today, which is consistent with what we saw for the entirety of last week and much of August.” The S&P/TSX composite index was down 34.65 points at 20,483.42. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 110.02 points at 35.625.40. The S&P 500 index was up 11.71 points at 4,479.71, while the Nasdaq composite was down 29.14 points at 14,793.76. The Canadian dollar traded for 79.56 cents US compared with 79.91 cents US on Friday. The September crude oil contract was down US$1.15 at US$67.29 per barrel and the September natural gas contract was up 8 cents at US$3.95 per mmBTU. The December gold contract was up US$11.60 at US$1,789.80 an ounce and the September copper contract was down six cents at US$4.33 a pound. Fehr said it’s normal for markets to be quiet in the dog days of summer. In addition, he said, fundamentals remain quite positive, which may be preventing investors from being spooked by the political situation in Afghanistan, the ongoing concerns about the Delta variant, or the upcoming Canadian election. “We’ve got a U.S. and Canadian, and frankly a global, economy that — while proceeding in fits and starts — is still very much on the road to recovery,” Fehr said. “So it’s not overly surprising we would see equities look past a little bit of geopolitical uncertainty.” Still, Fehr said he doesn’t expect the current market stability to continue indefinitely. He said it’s likely some investors are in a holding pattern waiting for the end of summer, which will likely bring with it an expected decision from the U.S. central bank on tapering off bond purchases. “I do think as we transition into the fall and people come back from vacation, we’re probably going to see some element of volatility and larger market swings come back into the picture,” Fehr said.

"2021-08-19","Full text: Ali Duale remembers how cold it was the first winter he spent in Nova Scotia about 24 years ago. He had come to Halifax from Somalia as a refugee with his wife and kids. It was one of many things Duale adapted to over the years. “Halifax was a place of the beginning of my life (and) had a lot of challenges. Not able to speak the language. Not able to relate to it culturally. But I'm glad I made the decision to stay and get at what I am today,” said Duale, who is the Liberal candidate for Halifax Armdale. Running in the election is one way Duale hopes to give back to the community who welcomed him with kindness and support since he first arrived, he said. He added that part of his efforts if elected will be to foster a closer relationship and understanding between new immigrants and other people in Nova Scotia. “In this province, there are nice people … but it’s not good enough to be nice to somebody. It’s also good to not only accept people, but also invite them … to your life … and learn who they are.” Duale is one of four candidates The Chronicle Herald spoke with who are first-generation immigrants. There are at least seven candidates in this year’s elections who were once newcomers in Canada. The NDP has three candidates, said a spokesperson with the party. Claudia Chender and Merydie Ross were both born in the U.S. and came to Canada when they were young. Jerome Lagmay, who immigrated from the Philippines in 2011, is the third candidate. A spokesperson with the Progressive Conservatives said they didn’t have time to check with all their candidates but were sure of only two: Nargis DeMolitor, who was born in Tanzania and has been living in Clayton Park West for 35 years, and Sura Hadad."

"2021-08-19","Full text: Parties promise economic help as campaign begins OTTAWA - The federal parties took the first full day of campaigning to lay planks in their plans to revive the country's economy after months of pain from the COVID-19 pandemic, and options for covering the costs. Unprecedented aid has flowed from federal coffers since the onset of the pandemic last year, which parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux estimates will hit $352 billion in direct support by 2026 when all measures come to a close under existing plans. Business groups said Monday their members were looking for a detailed road map for recovery, including targeted aid for businesses still smarting from public health restrictions through to next year and debt relief for small companies that piled on debt to survive the downturn. The Liberals promised to extend a hiring credit first unveiled in their recent budget through to the end of March 2022. They also pledged to provide extra help to the hardest hit sectors like tourism and live theatre that are facing a steeper climb back to pre-pandemic levels. ""For hard-hit businesses who get the workers they need, to workers who get the jobs they need to support their families, this is a win-win,"" Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said in Longueuil, Que. Trudeau said the final bill would be dictated by how quickly the economy recovers and aid would no longer be needed. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole took the first full day of campaigning to lay out his party's full platform, which similarly aims to create jobs by spending in the immediately future, spur growth at levels above the budget officer's outlook, and balance the budget by 2031. ""We're making sure we put a recovery plan forward and that we're never again unprepared for a crisis or running massive deficits in good times like Mr. Trudeau,"" O'Toole said. His plan also unwinds the Trudeau government's child-care system and replace it with a tax credit that O'Toole said would help low-income families cover up to 75 per cent of daycare costs. The pledge brought a sharp retort from Trudeau, argued the Conservative plan would hurt women. Meanwhile, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh promised to pry money out of the pockets of CEOs who saw their compensation rise even as their companies received federal business aid, adding to other New Democrat promises to tax the ultrarich to pad government revenues coming out of the pandemic. ""There are lots of ways for us to make sure that burden doesn't fall on you or your families, doesn't fall on workers, doesn't fall on small businesses,"" Singh said in the downtown Toronto riding once held by former NDP leader Jack Layton. ""We can ask the wealthiest corporations, the super-rich to start contributing fairly to pay their fair share and we can invest that back into people."" But the day was also taken over by other issues, including the government's efforts to help Afghans who aided Canadian troops flee Afghanistan as the Taliban retook power, and mandatory vaccination rules for workers and travellers — signalling what may face the leaders between now and voting day on Sept. 20. Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet spent the morning criticizing the inability of the Trudeau government to produce vaccines in Canada, saying that it was necessary for Quebec to have provincial production capacity rather than relying on foreign companies. He also talked about the environment, telling reporters in English that it was necessary for Alberta to ween itself off of oil and gas with federal help. ""Solutions exist and we are willing to help and to accept the fact that more money would go there,"" Blanchet said, ""because we are all going to pay, the whole planet, if nothing is done."" Similarly, Green Leader Annamie Paul called for an end to the construction of new pipelines, fracking, and oil and gas exploration so Canada could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reshape the economy. ""We are going to be talking a lot about our green future and the climate in this election,"" Paul said at an event in Toronto. ""We are going to be talking concretely about how we get from here to there and how we can ensure a safe, sustainable future that ensures that Canada … becomes a competitive, green, global economy.""

The agency says boxes with ballots in them were secured in a locked room that wasn't breached. (The Canadian Press) --- (NS-Elxn) Nova Scotians are heading to the polls tomorrow for a provincial election. Liberal Leader Iain Rankin is hoping to regain his post with a majority government. Rankin was voted leader of the Nova Scotia Liberals — and therefore the province’s premier — when Stephen McNeil stepped down earlier this year. He’s up against Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Houston and New Democrat Leader Gary Burrill. (The Canadian Press) --- (NS-Elxn-Numbers) Numbers from Nova Scotia’s elections authority indicate early voting was a popular choice for residents ahead of tomorrow’s vote.

"2021-08-18","Full text: Trudeau triggers election with Sept. 20 vote OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pulled the plug Sunday on his minority Liberal government, arguing that Canadians deserve a say on how to finish the fight against COVID-19 and build back the shattered economy. But opposition leaders blasted Trudeau for putting his quest for a majority ahead of the health and safety of Canadians, plunging the country into what they called an unnecessary and reckless election just as a fourth wave of the deadly coronavirus is gathering steam across the country. Gov. Gen. Mary Simon agreed Sunday morning to Trudeau's request to dissolve Parliament for a 36-day campaign — the shortest allowed by law — that will culminate in a Sept. 20 vote. Addressing Canadians afterwards outside Rideau Hall, Trudeau said Canada is at a pivotal moment, ""maybe the most important since 1945 and certainly in our lifetimes"" and Canadians need to choose how they want to proceed. ""The decisions your government makes right now will define the future your kids and grandkids will grow up in,"" he said. ""So in this pivotal, consequential moment, who wouldn't want a say? Who wouldn't want their chance to help decide where our country goes from here?"" He challenged opposition leaders to explain why they don't think Canadians deserve a say. Trudeau's justification for going to the polls a little less than two years after the last election was greeted with skepticism. Opposition leaders pointed out that the Liberals have been able to pass pandemic relief bills, a throne speech and a budget, surviving every confidence vote along the way. ""A leader who cared about the best interests of Canadians would be straining every sinew to secure the recovery right now. Instead, Justin Trudeau has called an election,"" said Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole. Even so, O'Toole said Canadians ""deserve to know what their politicians will deliver, they deserve to know that there's a plan and they deserve a government that will keep its word."" He touted his own five-point ""Canada recovery plan"" that promises, among other things, to create one million jobs and balance the federal budget in 10 years. Launching his campaign in Montreal, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called it a ""selfish summer election,"" triggered because Trudeau is ""fed up"" with New Democrats forcing his government to do more to financially support people hurt by the pandemic and pushing him to impose a tax on the ""ultrarich."" ""It was New Democrats that delivered the help that people needed,"" Singh said, taking credit for insisting on more generous emergency aid programs. ""Everyone across Canada benefited from New Democrats being in Ottawa and I say to folks imagine how much more we could do with more New Democrats elected."" Singh also criticized Trudeau for calling an election just as the president of Afghanistan fled the country as Taliban insurgents entered the capital, Kabul. Trudeau, who announced Sunday that Canadian diplomatic personnel are on their way back to Canada, insisted the election campaign will not impede his government's efforts to evacuate Afghans who helped Canada's mission or to accept 20,000 refugees who've already fled Afghanistan. The Liberals are gambling that general satisfaction with the government's handling of the pandemic — a world-leading vaccination rate and the unprecedented billions doled out in emergency aid programs — will propel them past the 170 seats needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons. However, public opinion polls suggest a majority is far from certain. Trudeau signalled Sunday that Liberals will use the issue of mandatory vaccinations, a notion that polls suggest is hugely popular, as a wedge against the Conservatives. As an example of the kinds of choices that Canadians need to make, he pointed to his government's decision to require mandatory vaccinations for federal public servants and workers in federally regulated sectors. He noted that Alberta Conservative MP David Yurdiga has called that ""tyrannical."" ""Well, the answer to tyranny is to have an election and I think people who disagree with this government or disagree with this direction should have an opportunity to make themselves heard,"" he said. But Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet accused Trudeau of contradicting himself. If the pandemic is so serious that vaccinations must be made mandatory, Blanchet said, surely it's too dangerous to call an election. O'Toole accused Trudeau of ""trying to divide people"" over vaccinations. Nevertheless, he was on the defensive trying to explain why his party does not support mandatory vaccinations and won't require its candidates to be double vaccinated before they start going door-to-door or attending campaign events. ""(Vaccines) are the critical tool in turning the page on COVID-19. We have to try and encourage and have as many people as vaccinated as possible and then take reasonable precautions to use other tools to keep all Canadians safe,"" O'Toole said. Late Sunday night, O'Toole released a statement proposing an alternative to mandatory vaccinations. He said a Conservative government would have unvaccinated federal employees and air passengers pass COVID-19 tests instead. He also said federal public servants who are not vaccinated would need to pass a rapid test every day. Green Leader Annamie Paul launched her campaign emphasizing the need for urgent action on the climate crisis but she also joined the chorus denouncing Trudeau for calling an election amid the pandemic. ""We're here because the Liberals have decided that they want all the power, that they want a majority and they think that now is the best time to get it,"" said Paul at an event in the riding of Toronto Centre, where she is making her third attempt to win a seat in the Commons. The election call comes days after Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, warned the country is in the midst of a fourth wave of the pandemic. Case numbers have been steadily rising in recent weeks, driven by the more contagious Delta variant. Tam has said she believes Canadians should be able to vote safely in a pandemic election, provided public health protocols are followed. At dissolution, the Liberals had 155 seats, the Conservatives 119, the Bloc Québécois 32, the NDP 24 and the Greens two. There were also five Independents and one vacancy. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2021. Note to readers: This is a corrected story.

"2021-08-17","Full text: N.S. election believed tighter than expected HALIFAX - As Nova Scotia's month-long election campaign draws to a close, it appears Tuesday's vote could be a lot tighter than initially expected. The incumbent Liberals, who are seeking a rare third term in office, were widely expected to cruise back to power at the start of what many predicted would be a quick and sleepy summertime campaign. It was also believed the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic would be its ace in the hole, and while that may still ultimately hold true it's clear something has happened over the last four weeks. ""What happened is a good campaign broke out and the Liberals have been slumping somewhat,"" said David Johnson, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, in a recent interview. Johnson credited the Progressive Conservatives and party Leader Tim Houston with running an ""excellent campaign,"" adding the New Democrats under Gary Burrill had also put in a strong effort. But it also didn't help that Liberal Leader Iain Rankin's campaign was thrown off balance during the campaign's first week, when it was revealed that party staff had pressured Liberal candidate Robyn Ingraham to drop out because she had previously sold revealing photos of herself on the website OnlyFans. Ingraham also alleged the party had told her to cite her mental health issues as the reason for leaving, prompting more negative headlines in the campaign's second week. Rankin managed to stay the course afterwards, preaching an optimistic but more tight-fisted approach to the province's finances and arguing for targeted spending in areas of need such as health care and long-term care as the best way to help the economy emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. The 38-year-old Rankin also did his best to paint Houston as a right-leaning Conservative, a message Johnson said the party successfully countered over the course of the campaign. He said Houston has managed to position his party to the left of the Rankin Liberals in terms of public spending, deficits and health care spending. The Tories, in fact, are proposing a big-spending platform that is aimed at improving the health care system — an issue that has been the 51-year-old Houston's singular focus. Johnson notes that Houston has also been quick to pounce on any comparisons to hard-line Conservative premiers from other parts of the country such as Ontario's Doug Ford or Jason Kenney of Alberta. ""In one of the debates he said his public spending would be more akin to that of Justin Trudeau than anybody else,"" Johnson said. The NDP's Burrill, 66, has also run a steady and traditionally progressive campaign, staging daily events where he chats with someone about issues effecting their lives. The party, which had only five seats at the dissolution of the legislature, has aimed much of its efforts to regaining its power base in the greater Halifax and Sydney, N.S. areas by highlighting issues such as health care, affordable housing and rent control. Margaret Brigley, CEO of Halifax-based polling firm Narrative Research, said indications are that momentum has changed after the Liberals entered the race in a strong position. Brigley said a number of factors could influence the outcome including a summertime vote and the expansion of the number of seats in the legislature from 51 to 55. Another factor, she noted, is the fact that 13 incumbents including 11 veteran Liberals opted not to seek reelection, leaving their ridings wide open. She said the parties' ability to get supporters to the polls will be key in what's expected to be an election with low voter turnout. ""I think this is really one that is just too difficult to predict because there are so many factors at play,"" Brigley said. ""Whoever is successful in getting their support out — it could really make a difference."" The election will feature the return of the so-called protected Acadian ridings of Richmond, Argyle and Clare and the predominantly African-Nova Scotian riding of Preston. Johnson said while the Liberals have tended to do well in those districts in the past, they may well have to take all four on Tuesday. ""Maybe an early indication of problems for them is if they are in tight races or are even losing some of those ridings,"" he said. At dissolution, the Liberals held 24 of 51 seats, followed by the Progressive Conservatives with 17. The New Democrats had five seats, and there were three Independents and two vacancies.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Canada shuts down embassy in Afghanistan Canadians working to evacuate allies from Afghanistan described chaos, fear and disappointment on Sunday as Canada shut down its embassy in Kabul and suspended diplomatic relations amid a Taliban advance in the capital. The federal government said the situation in Afghanistan poses ""serious challenges"" to its ability to ensure safety and security at the embassy. “After consulting with Canada’s Ambassador to Afghanistan, the decision was made to temporarily suspend our diplomatic operations in Kabul,"" the federal ministers of foreign affairs, immigration and defence said in a joint statement. The ministers said safety of Canadian personnel is a top priority, adding that staff are ""safely on their way back to Canada."" “The Canadian embassy will resume its operations as soon as the security situation in Afghanistan allows us to guarantee appropriate service and adequate security for our staff,"" they said. The Taliban have seized nearly all of Afghanistan in just over a week and breached the capital on Sunday. Officials told the Associated Press that President Ashraf Ghani had flown out of the country earlier in the day, as personnel were evacuated from the U.S. Embassy and other western missions and staff destroyed sensitive documents. Commercial flights out of Kabul's international airport were reportedly suspended amid the rush of people trying to leave. Dave Morrow, a retired corporal with the Canadian-Afghan Interpreters group, said he and other volunteers were receiving panicked messages from Afghans who feared they had been left to fend for themselves. ""The level of panic on the ground is indescribable,"" Morrow said by phone from Montreal. ""It's a very dark time for everybody involved."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the violence in Afghanistan on Sunday, adding Canada remains committed to the Afghan people and the country. ""We are heartbroken at the situation the Afghan people find themselves in today,"" Trudeau said from Ottawa moments before formally launching a federal election campaign. ""This is especially so given the sacrifices of Canadians who believed and continue to believe in the future of Afghanistan. We will continue to work with allies and the international community to ensure that those efforts were not in vain."" Canada has committed to taking in 20,000 refugees from the country who have already fled. It also has said it is working to evacuate Afghans who have assisted Canada over the years. On Sunday, the government said it was working with allies such as the United States to keep that immigration program for interpreters going, though Trudeau said that mission would depend on the ""extremely fast evolving"" conditions on the ground. ""We will continue to work to get as many Afghan interpreters and their families out as quickly as possible as long as the security situation holds,"" he said. Morrow described the situation in Afghanistan as a worst-case scenario, but a predictable one that his group and others had been calling on Ottawa to mitigate for months. He argued that the Canadian government had failed in its response and said his group had begun exploring other alternatives to help contacts on the ground, with diminishing hope for success. ""How do you tell somebody that, I'm sorry, but we're probably not going to be able to get you out,"" he said ""A lot of us veterans are having that conversation right now with interpreters that believed in us and it's heartbreaking. There's going to have to be a reckoning very soon about what this means as a country to just let this happen."" Others criticized the government for triggering an election instead of focusing on allies who need immediate help. Jack Harris, deputy defence critic for the federal New Democrats, said in a tweet that he was concerned to hear reports of 100 Nepalese workers at Canada's embassy who were not included in the evacuation effort. ""Canada must take measures to ensure their safety,"" Harris said. ""Instead of focusing on evacuating those at risk in Afghanistan, today Justin Trudeau is calling an election."" Andrew Rusk of advocacy group Not Left Behind also criticized the timing of the election call and the closure of the embassy, a move he said meant ""effectively halting the government’s extraction efforts"" for stranded workers who supported Canada. ""As our government pursues a majority, they’ve turned their back on both Afghanistan and our Veteran community,"" he said in a statement. In an interview, Rusk said his group is hearing reports of violence targeting Afghans who worked with Canada, including some recent killings, and of ""pandemonium"" in Kabul as people scramble for options to get out. He said the Canadian government was too slow to act on calls to rescue people, leaving it to volunteers to field their desperate please for help. ""This isn't something that a bunch of veterans and other Canadians should be taking the leadership role on. It has happened because there is a gap in leadership within the federal government,"" he said.

"2021-08-17","Full text: HALIFAX - As Nova Scotia's provincial election campaign winds down, it appears Tuesday's vote could be a lot tighter than initially thought. Heading into the election call it was believed the incumbent Liberals, who are seeking a rare third term in office, would likely cruise back to power. But Cape Breton University political scientist David Johnson says the Progressive Conservatives and N-D-P have changed the equation by mounting strong campaigns. Margaret Brigley, C-E-O of Halifax-based polling firm Narrative Research, says indications are that momentum has changed after the Liberals entered the race in a strong position. But Brigley says the end result is too difficult to predict because of factors such as the expansion of the number of seats in the legislature from 51 to 55, and the high number of incumbents who aren't running, including 11 Liberals. She says the parties' ability to get supporters to the polls will be key in what's expected to be an election with low voter turnout. --- Subject: Provincial elections"

"2021-08-17","Full text: Liberals launch ad campaign ahead of likely vote OTTAWA - Evidence that a federal election is on the horizon continued to mount on Saturday as the Liberal party unveiled a series of campaign-style advertisements a day before the widely anticipated vote is expected to be called. The party's ad blitz features Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who sources have previously indicated will visit Gov. Gen. Mary Simon on Sunday with a request to dissolve Parliament and trigger an election that is expected to culminate in a Sept. 20 voting day. The campaign would play out as a fourth wave of COVID-19 begins to unfold across the country, but the Liberal ads hearken back to earlier stages of the crisis and showcase the party's handling of earlier stages of the pandemic. The English-language ad, titled ""Relentless,"" features shots of Trudeau engaging with Canadians before and during the global outbreak as well as a voice-over exhorting Canadians to keep ""moving forward."" The French-language ad, titled ""Solidarity,"" shows the Liberal leader talking about the resilience of Canadians during the pandemic and his government's work to support them. ""Since the beginning (of the pandemic), we helped workers and businesses keep their heads above water,"" Trudeau said in the French-language ad. ""We made sure we had vaccine doses, and we helped the provinces distribute those doses faster."" The adds will begin airing on TV over the next week as part of a broader digital engagement strategy, the party said in a statement. New Democrat Deputy Leader Alexandre Boulerice lost no time in criticizing the contents of the Liberal ad campaign, saying life in Canada under Trudeau's government has become more expensive while the income of working Canadians has not increased. ""Justin Trudeau says nice things but has no intention of doing what's needed to truly help people,"" he said in a statement. The Conservatives have not yet unveiled their full election ad campaign, but have already drawn fire from within their own ranks for a clip released on Friday. The ad, which depicts Trudeau's face pasted on top of an image of a bratty character from classic children's film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" was roundly condemned by sitting Conservative MPs as juvenile and ill-suited to a high-stakes event such as a federal election. “Asking to be the Governing Party of Canada is serious business, requiring serious people making good, reasonable and mature decisions,” Alberta Tory MP Blaine Calkins wrote in a tweet. ""I trust the decision maker who decided to post this tasteless and appalling video will be brought up to speed."" The party did not immediately respond to request for comment on the ad. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole has previously indicated he doesn't want to campaign during a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that he's ready if Trudeau decides to call an election. ""We are going to have a totally different approach from Mr. Trudeau on the economy, on jobs, on emergency programs,"" he said.

"2021-08-17","Full text: Trudeau confirms plan to visit Governor General OTTAWA - A federal election campaign became all but imminent on Saturday as the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed plans to visit the Governor General in hopes of triggering a national vote. He's expected to arrive at Rideau Hall at 10 a.m. on Sunday morning, according to his official itinerary, which indicates he'll be accompanied by his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau. Once there, he's expected to meet with newly minted Gov. Gen. Mary Simon to request that she dissolve Parliament, a precursor to the official start of a federal election. A formal call is expected at a news conference to be held shortly after their meeting. An election date has not formally been set, though it is expected that Canadians will head to the polls on Sept. 20, which would be the minimum length of time allowed for a federal campaign. The election call, if given the green light by Simon, will unfold as a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic begins to sweep across the country and amid opposition accusations it is reckless and unnecessary. Trudeau's Liberals, however, argue Canadians deserve a chance to rate the government's handling of the crisis and to decide whether they agree with its ambitious and costly plan to rebuild the economy once the pandemic recedes. The Liberals have also maintained that a minority Parliament had become toxic and dysfunctional and that they need a strong majority mandate in order to implement the recovery plan. Opposition parties dismiss these claims, pointing out that the government has not lost any confidence votes, including on its spring budget. The contend that holding an election during a pandemic is irresponsible and dangerous, but have nonetheless been crisscrossing the country on campaign-style stops in recent weeks. Trudeau is launching a campaign just short of two years after the last vote, when the Liberals were reduced to a minority government, and polls suggest it's far from certain the party can snag a majority this time. But the Liberal leader is gambling that general satisfaction with his handling of the pandemic — and the unprecedented billions doled out in emergency aid — will propel them past the 170 seats needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, for his part, will likely seek to seize on his party's reputation for fiscal restraint as anxieties grow over inflation and rising debt levels following a massive $354-billion deficit for 2020-21, which pushed Canada's net debt past $1 trillion for the first time ever. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, adopting a tax-the-rich populism and an upbeat tone, is set to argue he pried pandemic relief out of a reluctant minority government, including beefed-up wage subsidies, emergency benefits and sick-leave payments. Meanwhile, the Bloc Québécois' Yves-François Blanchet is targeting Conservative seats in and around Quebec City where he hopes his message of nationalism — though not outright sovereignty — will resonate. The Liberals currently have 155 seats, the Conservatives 119, the Bloc Quebecois 32, the NDP 24 and the Greens two. There are also four Independents and one vacancy.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Political parties in the northeast are ramping up their campaigns and getting their candidates ready ahead of an expected federal election. Speculation is running rampant that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday will call a snap election for Sept. 20. Nickel Belt and Algoma-Manitoulin-Kapuskasing ridings will both see incumbents seeking another term, and all eyes will be on Sudbury as Liberal MP Paul Lefebvre steps down after six years. “The other nine Northern Ontario ridings, including Parry Sound and Muskoka, all have incumbents running in this election,” said David Tabachnick, a political science professor at Nipissing University. “To me, that suggests a lot of status quo here in the North. We have six Liberals, two NDP, and two Conservatives right now. But could things change? Absolutely.” According to 338Canada.com, Algoma-Manitoulin-Kapuskasing incumbent MP Carol Hughes is in the safe zone, with projections suggesting that the NDP candidate could walk away with just over half of the vote. Hughes has been the MP for the traditionally NDP/Liberal riding since 2008, outperforming Conservative party candidate Dave Williamson by more than 6,000 votes in the last federal election. The projections could fluctuate in this riding as more candidates enter the playing field. Hughes's only rival is Conservative candidate John Sagman, a professional engineer who has worked in the mining and forestry sectors across Canada. The Algoma region has not elected a Conservative MP since the 1891 federal election. “It’s very likely that MP Carol Hughes will win, of course, in the Algoma-Manitoulin-Kapuskasing riding,” said Tabachnick. On the other hand, “the Nickel Belt riding trades between the Liberals and the NDP. The incumbent, Marc Serre, has been there since 2015, but there is some uncertainty about what might happen there.” Liberal Serre will face off against the riding’s NDP candidate and CUPE national health and safety representative Andréanne Chénier, who is expected to give the Liberals a run for their money. Nickel Belt is a toss-up right now, 338Canada.com says. The Liberals snagged 19,046 votes compared to the NDP’s 15,656 in 2019. Charles Humphrey is the Conservative party candidate for Nickel Belt . Crag Gravelle, a 24-year-old from Greater Sudbury hoping to fight for progressive policies to move Canada forward into the future, will run for the Greens. The Liberal party in Sudbury selected Viviane Lapoint as their candidate. She is up against NDP candidate Nadia Verelli, a former political science professor at Laurentian University who was laid off during that school’s program cuts earlier this year. Local doctor Ian Symington is the candidate for the federal Conservatives. This is his first time running for office. Like Nickel Belt, Sudbury is a toss-up as we head into an election, 338Canada.com says. Race could be unpredictable Although things look status quo right now, experts say it’s still too early to predict what might happen. “It is the middle of summer during a global pandemic and the election is not actually looming. I don’t know how many people are really spending that much time thinking about an upcoming election,” said Michael Johns, visiting professor in the politics department at York University. Johns said that the general political climate in Canada right now is already uncertain without adding the COVID-19 pandemic into the mix. “You have the Green Party and the Conservatives that seem to be experiencing internal turmoil, and there’s a variety of difficulties and scandals involving the current government. The NDP is trying to gain some traction,” he said. “Add the pandemic, and it becomes really difficult to forecast what people will be interested in. All of this is adding up to an uncertain election.” Elections Canada has been watching other nations closely to learn best practices for holding an election during a pandemic and they are prepared for that possibility. But Johns said what happens with the pandemic will determine what the campaign will be about. “If things continue to improve, the Liberals might be confident enough that people won’t blame them for what went wrong,” he said. “If the Delta variant takes hold and vaccine coverage rates aren’t high enough, it would be considered irresponsible to trigger an election at that time.” When it comes to the big campaign issues, most of northeastern Ontario – and the country as a whole – has its sights set firmly on the future of the country. “The actual pandemic response will definitely play a role in this election, but I think people desperately want to move beyond the pandemic, and I think there’s some really big questions about what a post-pandemic world looks like,” said Johns. “The interesting thing about this election is that it will be a lot of forward-thinking. Given current events, everyone is wondering about the future of climate change, Canadian-Indigenous relations, and a post-COVID economy.” Various issues The federal government spent an enormous amount of money keeping the economy afloat during the pandemic, providing supports like CERB and buying vaccines, and that bill will eventually come due. The business community in the Sudbury and Nickel Belt ridings will be looking to candidates who can listen to their concerns and answer some key questions about COVID-19 recovery. “They want to know what that recovery will look like. The mitigations that were put in place – how long are they going to be there?” said Neil Milner, board chair of the Greater Sudbury Chamber of Commerce. “What can the government do to help businesses find workers so they can reopen? What red tape can they get out of the way so that people can focus on their business?” The pandemic has hit local businesses hard, and many are struggling both financially and to find workers to fill vacant positions. The community will be looking to the federal government for further tax reform so they can recover as quickly as possible. Canadian-Indigenous relations will also be top of mind for many in light of recent events, including the recovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at Indian Residential Schools. “There needs to be a commitment, some sort of commission, to help gather the stories, identify the bodies, and have those bodies returned to their communities if they desire that,” said Reg Niganobe, Grand Council Chief of the Anishinabek Nation. “We need something along those lines to document how this happened so that the stories are gathered and shared so that people never forget this took place in Canada.” Resource and land use will be another major issue for Indigenous populations in terms of the implementation of treaties and equitable partnerships with First Nations communities. “The federal government could always do much better. I would hope that every candidate is able to point to something on the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples or the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report and push some of these issues forward,” said Niganobe. “A lot of these reports have the answers in them or at least guidance on how to move forward. The federal government needs the desire and the will to actually execute them.” As forest fires ravage northwestern Ontario, eastern Manitoba, and western Canada, and tornados touch down as close as Barrie, climate change issues will also be on voters’ minds. “Climate change is no longer just a Green Party issue. I live in Barrie and my house got hit by that tornado last (month),” said Michael Johns. “I think the party that is best able to present a vision for the future of Canada and what that world is going to look like will resonate with people.” Sudbury riding The Sudbury riding includes many communities within the City of Greater Sudbury, except the Valley, Chelmsford, Azilda and Onaping, and covers 977 square kilometres. It is a traditionally Liberal riding and voters have elected eight Liberal MPs since 1988. Current MP: Paul Lefebvre (not running again)"

Michael McCardell of Hammond, Ind., was later sentenced to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to the crime. In 1941, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Atlantic Charter. The signing followed a secret Second World War strategy session aboard the ""USS Augusta"" and ""HMS Prince of Wales"" in Placentia Bay, Nfld. The Atlantic Charter guaranteeing freedom of speech and worship formed the basis of the United Nations Charter. In 1941, German spy Josef Jakobs became the last person executed at the Tower of London. He was shot. In 1945, the Second World War came to an end with VJ Day - Victory in Japan Day. U.S. President Harry Truman announced that Japan had unconditionally surrendered just days after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The official document was signed Sept. 1, 1945, aboard the U.S. battleship ""Missouri"" with Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepting the surrender on behalf of the Allies. In 1947, Pakistan became an independent country. The Indian subcontinent was officially partitioned, establishing the self-governing dominions of Pakistan, a Muslim state, and India, a Hindu state. The partitioning ended some 200 years of British rule. In 1951, American newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst died in California at age 88. In 1958, all 99 people, half of them Americans, aboard a KLM Royal Dutch airliner were killed when the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about 210 kilometres west of Ireland. The plane went down without even a radio report of trouble. The crash was later blamed on a malfunctioning propeller. In 1962, the 12-kilometre-long Mont Blanc Tunnel, extending from Courmayeur, Italy, to Chamonix, France, was opened. In 1969, after the worst fighting in 30 years between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, Britain sent troops into the province. The violence included gunfights, gasoline bombings and fire attacks in Belfast, Londonderry and other parts of Northern Ireland. In 1972, a Soviet-built Ilyushin 62 crashed minutes after takeoff from East Berlin's airport, killing 156 people. In 1973, the U.S. bombing of Cambodia came to a halt, marking the official end to 12 years of American combat in Indochina. In 1974, Turkey launched a second military operation in Cyprus.

In 1994, the Venezuelan-born terrorist known as ""Carlos the Jackal"" was captured in Sudan. Vladimir Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, blamed for a string of terrorist bombings and killings across Western Europe in the 1970s and '80s, was taken to France for trial. In 1997, he was convicted of the 1975 murders of two French investigators and sentenced to life in prison. (In 2011, he was convicted for organizing four deadly attacks in France in the 1980s and sentenced again to life in prison.) In 1996, the National Party, architects of South African apartheid, moved to the opposition benches for the first time in 48 years. In 1997, Timothy McVeigh was formally sentenced to death for the 1995 Oklahoma bombing. He was executed June 11, 2001. In 2001, U.S.-based electronics behemoth Best Buy Co. agreed to buy its Canadian rival, Future Shop Ltd., for $580 million. (In 2015, 66 Future Shops were closed and the 65 others stores were re-branded as Best Buy.) In 2003, the biggest blackout in North American history hit most of Ontario and the eastern seaboard, including New York, Cleveland and Detroit, leaving 50 million people without power and shutting down 100 power plants, including 22 nuclear plants. Failure of three transmission lines in northern Ohio was the likely trigger of the blackout that cascaded into Canada. Ontario Premier Ernie Eves declared a state of emergency. Power was restored within a couple of days but consumers were asked to conserve energy use. In 2005, a Cypriot airliner belonging to Helios Airlines crashed into mountains near Grammatiko, 45 kilometres from Athens, killing all 121 people aboard. In 2007, Mattel Inc. recalled 19 million Chinese-made toys containing small magnets that posed a choking danger or coated in potentially hazardous amount of lead paint. Nearly 900,000 of the toys were sold in Canada. The toys included Polly Pocket dolls and Batman action figures. In 2008, Libya and the United States signed a deal settling all outstanding terror-related lawsuits between the two nations, clearing the way for the restoration of full diplomatic relations. In 2009, Charles Manson follower Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, 60, convicted of trying to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford in 1975, was released from a Texas prison hospital after more than three decades behind bars. In 2013, Egyptian riot police stormed two protest camps in Cairo where supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi had gathered since June to demand his reinstatement. It sparked running street battles between Morsi's supporters and security forces across Egypt. At least 638 people were killed and over 4,000 were injured nationwide. In 2014, Michael Sona, a former junior Conservative campaign staffer and the lone person charged in the 2011 robocalls election scandal, was convicted under the Canada Elections Act of wilfully preventing or endeavouring to prevent an elector from voting. (He was sentenced to nine months in prison, the first person ever to serve time for violating the Canada Elections Act.) In 2015, the American flag rose over the newly opened U.S. Embassy in Cuba for the first time in 54 years, making a symbolically charged victory lap for the Obama administration's new policy of engagement with Cuba. In 2016, Jamaica's Usain Bolt won a record third consecutive gold medal in the 100-metre sprint. Canada's Andre De Grasse won the bronze medal with a personal best 9.91 seconds, one-tenth of a second behind Bolt. In 2016, Britain's Justin Rose won the first golfing gold medal at the Olympics since Canadian George S. Lyon won gold at the 1904 St. Louis Games. In 2017, a jury found former Denver radio host David Mueller guilty of groping pop star Taylor Swift during a backstage photo-op in 2013. He had sued Swift, claiming the allegation cost him his career and his reputation and she countersued for assault and battery and a request for a symbolic $1 judgment and the chance to stand up for other women. In 2018, East Coast painter Mary Pratt, whose vivid depictions of everyday objects won her international acclaim, died peacefully at her home in St. John's. She was 83. In 2018, smoke from hundreds of wildfires in British Columbia drifted into Alberta and prompted new air quality advisories in both provinces. Advisories would eventually be posted for areas stretching all the way to Manitoba. In 2018, a Christian university in British Columbia dropped a requirement that students sign a covenant forbidding sex outside of heterosexual marriage. The change followed a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that upheld the right of provincial law societies to deny accreditation to graduates of Trinity Western's proposed law school. The societies said the covenant amounted to discrimination of LGBTQ students. In 2018, a highway bridge in the Italian port city of Genoa collapsed during a heavy rainstorm, sending dozens of cars and trucks plunging 45 meters into a dry riverbed. The death toll, including those who later died in hospital, was at least 43 people. In 2019, Canada's ethics watchdog found Prime Minister Justin Trudeau violated the Conflict of Interest Act by improperly pressuring then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Mario Dion says that contravenes rules forbidding public office holders from using their position to try to influence a decision that would improperly further the private interests of a third party. Dion also said Trudeau improperly pushed Wilson-Raybould to consider partisan political interests in the matter, contrary to constitutional principles on prosecutorial independence and the rule of law. In 2019, the federal government issued a travel advisory warning Canadians to exercise a high degree of caution in Hong Kong. The advisory was posted amid massive protests calling for democratic reforms and reports that the Chinese military was amassing on the border. About 300,000 Canadians live in Hong Kong. In 2019, the Saint John Police Force said the investigation into the 2011 killing of multi-millionaire businessman Richard Oland is no longer active, despite the acquittal of Oland's son on a charge of second-degree murder in the case. Police Chief Bruce Connell made the statement the day after New Brunswick's Public Prosecution Services announced it would not appeal Dennis Oland's acquittal. In response, the family of Dennis Oland said it would renew its offer of a reward to possibly provide the police with additional information or new evidence that Connell suggested would be required for further investigation to take place. In 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that two Canadians were among those killed in a deadly explosion in a port in Beirut on August 4th. Trudeau didn't disclose their names, but CBC reported that one of the two was a three-year-old girl. The blast killed more than 200 people, injured thousands more and destroyed large parts of Beirut. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: American history; Assaults; Canada Elections Act; Diplomatic & consular services; Military engagements; Presidents; Charters; Capital punishment; Retirement policies; World War II; Criminal sentences; Lead content; Murders & murder attempts; Toys; Human rights"

Seymour is experienced in municipal government, having worked for two-and-a-half years as an assistant to the clerk in the Rural Municipality of Lac du Bonnet, Man. Before taking that role, she worked as a corrections officer for 13 years in the province. “I like the order and the legal portions of the municipal administration and it was a good opportunity to make a career change, so I took it,” she said. “I find it exciting and I like to help people and be involved in the community. It’s a good way of being involved and being up-to-date on things.” She is currently in the process of completing her municipal certificate, which is the basis of training to be a municipal administrator. “There’s always a want for advancement, but I’m looking forward to learning this position and moving forward.” The city clerk is responsible for administering the city’s legislative obligations, including the preparation of council and committee agendas; recording the proceedings of council and committees and communicating the decisions of council; the custody and maintenance of all bylaws, minutes, corporate records and the corporate seal of the city; payroll and benefit administration; as well as conducting civic elections acting as returning officer. Audette was appointed to the role in Melfort during 2000, but has been working in municipal government since 1985 and the City of Melfort since 1992. She attended her last council meeting on Aug. 9, mentoring Seymour who began her role on Aug. 3. She’s now entering retirement. “Like I always said, the most satisfying career in municipal government is seeing change happen at a grassroots level,” Audette said, adding that she can’t isolate just one highlight. “There has been so much change and it’s just interesting with each individual council seeing them set their own priorities, and then as administrative staff how we work through implementing them as a team.” Subject: Local elections; Councils; Clerical personnel"
"2021-09-22","Full text: N.S. Tory leader leans left with help from ex-NDP HALIFAX - Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Houston sought to emphasize the ""progressive"" part of his party's name with an endorsement today from a former provincial NDP cabinet minister. Heading into the final weekend before Tuesday's provincial election, Houston was joined by Denise Peterson-Rafuse, who served as community services minister in Darrell Dexter's New Democrat government from 2009 to 2013. Houston said Peterson-Rafuse's offer of support despite differences in their past party allegiances was ""a welcome call."" Though she hadn't thought she would ever support the Tories, Peterson-Rafuse said she was drawn by the party's health-care platform and the distance Houston has put between himself and the more right-leaning federal Conservatives. ""It's gonna be probably tough for me in the next little bit, making this statement today,"" she told reporters Friday, ""but like I said, it doesn't take away from my NDP philosophies and my respect for the party."" Houston once again took time to differentiate himself from his federal counterparts — a note he has struck several times during the election — saying that his party is not beholden to the Conservatives in Ottawa. Like Houston has done repeatedly, Peterson-Rafuse criticized Liberal Leader Iain Rankin for his handling of the province's health-care system. She said the Tories ""have the better opportunity at this time to knock off the Liberals ... they have the whole package."" Nova Scotia NDP Leader Gary Burrill said in an emailed statement that Peterson-Rafuse was free to make her own choices but declined to elaborate. Peterson-Rafuse said she feels the NDP is not ready to govern because it has many new members who would face a steep learning curve if they came to power. ""What I learned coming into government is that ... we need some of that history,"" she said. ""You have to come up to speed on things, and we don't have time. We need to have a party that can come in and start immediately."" The Tories are proposing by far the most new spending of all parties in their first year in power — $553 million, including $430 million for the health-care sector. The New Democrats say they would spend $151 million during their first year in power for initiatives such as affordable housing, mental health care, child care and long-term care. The Liberal platform estimates spending of $93.2 million in the first year of their mandate. Houston said he felt the spending was both realistic and necessary to address systemic issues in health-care. ""The reality is we have to spend the money because we've had eight years of neglect,"" he said. The leaders were criss-crossing the province as election day drew near. Burrill spent time in the Halifax area Friday, where he reiterated the NDP's promise to improve mental health care. The plan involves opening more mental health clinics across the province providing prompt care and allowing key ""at-risk"" populations to have access to emergency mental health care. Houston continued his campaign along the province's South Shore while Rankin spent some time at a dairy farm in Shubenacadie Friday and highlighted the Liberal party's agriculture platform in a statement. The Liberals previously announced a Business Risk Management program, which aims to provide food producers with more compensation for losses, increasing rates for compensation to 80 per cent from 70 per cent. Rankin had no scheduled news conference Friday for the second straight day.

"2021-08-16","Full text: How the leaders will make their election pitch OTTAWA - The lines of attack have been traced for months, but now federal parties' battle plans are poised to go into effect with an election campaign set to kick off Sunday. The Liberals hope to tout their record of steering the country through a global pandemic that threatened Canadians' health and economic stability, and can be expected to keep casting doubt on Conservatives' commitment to green efforts, LGBTQ rights and social programs. ""Notwithstanding what Erin O'Toole may say, this is a party composed, in the Liberal view, of a lot of climate change deniers,"" said Hamish Telford, an associate professor of political science at the University of the Fraser Valley. A bill to ban LGBTQ conversion therapy that the Liberals introduced late in the spring sitting faced pushback from some Tory legislators, providing another opening for the Grits to exploit. The spectre of scrapped child care could make for a third bogeyman after Ottawa signed funding agreements with eight premiers on its marquee budget item. The sign-offs come 15 years after a newly sworn-in Stephen Harper walked away from the preceding Liberal government's provincial daycare deals in favour of a $1,200 allowance to parents for each child under six. Telford says the Tories will fire back by framing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an ""elite, out-of-touch trust fund kid"" while portraying leader Erin O’Toole as the ""competent everyman … the guy next door, but very capable."" Conservatives may also seek to seize on their reputation for fiscal restraint as anxieties grow over inflation and rising debt levels following a massive $354-billion deficit for 2020-21, which pushed Canada's net debt past $1 trillion for the first time ever. ""We've had a government that's just spent a bunch of money trying to buy off Canadians, but it's left us with a debt headache unless we begin taking it on immediately,"" said Peter Graefe, a political science professor at McMaster University, paraphrasing the potential message. Criticism about the speed of the Liberal response to COVID-19 could also be in the offing, despite general satisfaction with federal vaccine procurement efforts. New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh, adopting a tax-the-rich populism and an upbeat tone, will test out whether his engaged delivery style and outsized social media presence will translate into votes as he accuses Trudeau of inaction on progressive goals. ""Jagmeet Singh has sort of repositioned himself as the new Jack Layton, the happy warrior,"" Telford said. Taxing high earners and big business in order to fund expanded social programs almost amounts to an NDP mantra, as it did in 2019. Singh can also point to a track record where, in his telling, he pried pandemic relief out of a reluctant minority government, including beefed-up wage subsidies, emergency benefits and sick-leave payments. Meanwhile, the Bloc Québécois' Yves-François Blanchet is targeting Conservative seats in and around Quebec City where he hopes his message of nationalism — though not outright sovereignty — will resonate. ""There's a real emphasis on the French language being under attack, and they can point to the recent choice of the Governor General (Mary Simon, who speaks English and Inuktitut but not French) as an indication the federal government has not pushed hard enough on protecting the French language,"" Graefe said. After losing five seats in Quebec last time around, the Liberals see a large chunk of the path to victory running through a province known for big swings from one election to another. To defend his new turf — the Bloc went from 10 to 32 seats in 2019 — Blanchet will paint Trudeau as ""not really a Quebecer; if he is, he's a Montrealer, not really a francophone,"" Telford said. Further west, Green Leader Annamie Paul is fighting an uphill battle to win a downtown Toronto riding and retain the party's two remaining spots in the House of Commons. She's banking on a core environmental pitch and renewed emphasis on progressive social concerns to elevate her above the internal strife that has engulfed the Greens in recent months. Trudeau intends to visit Simon on Sunday with a request to dissolve Parliament, triggering an election that would take place Sept. 20, according to a senior Liberal party source who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Opposition parties have said now is not the time to go to the polls, with unfinished business in the Commons and a fourth wave of COVID-19 on the rise. But the latter might not hinder Liberal prospects. ""It could work to their advantage,"" Graefe said, suggesting voters may not want to change horses midstream. ""I think a lot of the dissatisfaction is with the provincial management of the pandemic at the moment."" On top of what Graefe dubs the ""safe-pair-of-hands"" appeal, the governing party isn't above some conveniently timed funding announcements. Trudeau arrived in the Vancouver area last month to announce $1.3 billion in federal support for a SkyTrain extension that will connect the suburbs of Surrey and Langley. The 16-kilometre line will cut through several ridings, one that the Liberals won by fewer than four percentage points in 2019 and another they lost to the Tories by barely two. The Grits are currently 15 seats shy of the 170 needed for a majority. ""And I'm guessing they've identified about 30 ridings they're hoping they can turn,"" Telford said. ""So for the Liberals, the entire election is about those 30 ridings, and they will have very tailor-made policies and appeals to those ridings to turn them.""

"2021-08-16","Full text: North American stock markets flat to end week TORONTO - North American markets were flat on a low volume trading day to close off the week, with one analyst said investors are waiting for a sense of direction. Allan Small, senior investment advisor with IA Private Wealth, said the current situation with rising COVID-19 cases has left a feeling of uncertainty around which direction central banks will take around interest rate changes or tapering stimulus. “There really doesn’t seem to be any leading indicator or direction for the market today,” said Small, who said increases in equities over the past week have simply been because upward is the path of least resistance in the current environment. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 15.53 points at 35,515.38. The S&P 500 index was up 7.17 points at 4,468.00, while the Nasdaq composite was up 6.64 points at 14,822.90. The S&P/TSX composite index was down 2.53 points at 20,518.07. In Toronto, rising precious metal prices saved Canada’s main stock exchange from having a worse day. The December gold contract was up US$26.40 at US$1,782.40 an ounce and the September copper contract was up 3.1 cents at US$4.39 a pound. The TSX’s gold index was up 1.77 per cent and it’s materials index was up 1.38 per cent as a result. The energy sector lagged on the TSX Friday, with that subindex down 1.4 per cent. The September crude oil contract was down 65 cents at US$68.44 per barrel and the September natural gas contract was down 7.2 cents at US$3.86 per mmBTU. Looking ahead, Canadian inflation numbers that are set to come out next Wednesday could begin to give the market a reason to move one way or another. Small also said an upcoming election could also have an impact, but said movement would likely be based on whether the Liberal government claims a majority or not, rather than the campaign itself. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to trigger an election on Sunday by asking Gov. Gen. Mary Simon to dissolve Parliament. “It could affect our dollar and interest rates going forward,” said Small, who pointed out that in the meantime, August and September can be weak months in investing. “I would not be surprised to see some softening in the markets in the coming weeks,” said Small. That softness would be in spite of a strong season for second quarter reports, where many North American companies have met expectations without seeing substantial movements in their stock. “Even though earnings were fantastic this past quarter, we’re at the top end for a lot of these corporations in terms of valuation,” said Small. “It’s tough to buy them with these valuations and it’s tough to put money to work.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 13, 2021.

"2021-08-15","Full text: Who fires the starter's pistol for an election? OTTAWA - It's not like in the United States, where election day occurs like clockwork on the same week every four years — and has since before Canada was a country. North of the 49th parallel, the mechanics of calling voters to the polls are a little more complicated, with convention and the Constitution each playing a part. With a federal campaign expected to kick off this Sunday, here's a look at how an election is called in Canada: The first step The prime minister heads over to Rideau Hall to request the Governor General dissolve Parliament. If opposition MPs pass a motion stating they've lost confidence in the government, that too would prompt Justin Trudeau to pay a visit to the Queen's representative — Mary Simon, who was sworn in on July 26. This scenario played out during the last minority government in 2011, triggering an election that handed Stephen Harper a majority. A fixed-date election — federal legislation dictates the next one must take place on or before Oct. 16, 2023 — would also require a prime ministerial door knock at 1 Sussex Drive. But neither a deadline nor a direct shove from the House of Commons are pushing Trudeau toward the viceregal grounds. Instead he can exercise his prerogative as head of government to advise the Governor General for dissolution. What if Simon says no? Constitutionally, the Governor General — as the viceroy — is the only one authorized to call a new election. Conventionally, she only does so when advised by the prime minister. ""Put heavy quotation marks around the word 'advise,'"" says Peter Russell, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto. While only one governor general has refused that ""advice"" — Lord Byng turned down Mackenzie King's request in 1926, setting off a constitutional crisis — other viceregal representatives have found cause to spurn their first ministers. In 2017, British Columbia's lieutenant-governor said no to then-premier Christy Clark's suggestion to dissolve the legislature and trigger another election less than eight weeks after voters went to the polls. A governor general might also reasonably reject a dissolution request if other parties in the House of Commons could form government, Russell said. No bucking the Westminster system Canada's system of Parliament is derived from the United Kingdom's, whose roots go back eight centuries during which Parliament gradually whittled away the once overweening power of the monarchy in favour of representative democracy. The formal structure of Crown and Parliament remained, however. ""In that long tradition, the Crown called the first parliament in the 13th century,"" Russell said. ""And we've continued that."" With Parliament dissolved, who's running the show during an election campaign? The prime minister and cabinet remain in office throughout the race — and briefly after it — to keep the ship of state on course and respond to major events or emergencies. But their official roles are sharply curtailed — again, by convention: the ""caretaker convention."""

Many have expressed concerns about children returning to classrooms in September, especially since those under the age of 12 are not yet eligible for vaccines. (The Canadian Press) --- (Alta-Health-Harris) Public health advocates are raising concerns about the appointment of a man with ties to Health Minister Tyler Shandro to the board that helps run Alberta Health Services. The group Friends of Medicare says Harley R. Harris served as Shandro's chief financial officer for his 2019 election campaign. It says Harris also contributed money to his campaign. Sandra Azocar, executive director of Friends of Medicare, says his appointment to the board is deeply concerning for the future of public health care in Alberta. (CTV) --- (Manitoba-PC-Leadership) The Winnipeg Free Press is reporting that Families Minister Rochelle Squires is planning a run for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party. Squires, the member of the Manitoba legislature for Riel, is expected to confirm her candidacy today. Premier Brian Pallister announced on Tuesday in Brandon that he will not seek re-election but gave no indication when he will step down. Several current and former high-ranking politicians have said they are considering a run for the P-C leadership, including former Tory M-P Shelly Glover, Finance Minister Scott Fielding and Winnipeg city councillor Scott Gillingham. (Wpg FP) --- (Manitoba-Wildfires) Two First Nations communities left without power due to wildfire damage could be waiting months for Manitoba Hydro to complete repairs. Fires around Lake Winnipeg have burned hydro poles at Pauingassi and Little Grand Rapids. The N-D-P Opposition says returning power to people in those communities needs to be top priority. Manitoba Hydro says engineering staff are now working on a plan to replace the damaged power poles, which are located in extremely challenging terrain. (Wpg FP) --- (COVID-Sask) Post-secondary students in Saskatchewan are still waiting to hear if their schools will require them to have COVID-19 vaccines. The University of Saskatchewan, University of Regina and Saskatchewan Polytechnic all say they will release a statement in the coming days. The University of Toronto and other schools in some provinces are requiring students to show proof of vaccination. Tasnim Jaisee, president of the University of Saskatchewan Students' Union, says she would like to see vaccines made mandatory for students returning to campus. (CTV) --- (Sask-Conversion-Therapy) The N-D-P Opposition is calling on the Saskatchewan government to ban conversion therapy -- the attempt to change a person's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This after Regina city council passed a bylaw this week to ban it and Saskatoon passed a similar bylaw in February. Last month, 13 of 14 Saskatchewan M-Ps voted against the federal government's proposed Bill C-6 that would ban conversion therapy across the country. The Liberal bill passed in the Commons but the Senate adjourned for the summer before it could deal with the legislation.

"2021-09-22","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Aug. 13 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 13 ... What we are watching in Canada ... OTTAWA— Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to trigger an election on Sunday by asking Gov. Gen. Mary Simon to dissolve Parliament even though Canada’s top doctor says the country is now in the grips of a fourth wave of COVID-19. A senior Liberal Party of Canada source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss matters not public, confirmed Thursday the prime minister’s plan to visit Simon, with the election expected to take place on Sept. 20. The confirmation followed months of speculation that Trudeau would send Canadians to the polls two years after the last election, in which he was only able to secure a minority government. The real question had been when, rather than if, the prime minister would pull the trigger given the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, which chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam warned Thursday is again on the upswing. ""The latest national surveillance data indicate that a fourth wave is underway in Canada and that cases are plotting along a strong resurgence trajectory,"" Tam said during a federal COVID-19 update. Polls suggest it's far from certain the Liberals can regain a majority but Trudeau is gambling that general satisfaction with his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic — and the unprecedented billions doled out in emergency aid — will propel them to a majority. Opposition parties have blasted the idea of an early election and accused the Liberals of sending Canadians to the polls during the pandemic for the sole purpose of trying to win a majority, a move they describe as unnecessary and reckless. --- Also this ... VANCOUVER — Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou are expected to present their defence in a Vancouver court today, explaining why the Huawei executive should not be extradited to the United States to face fraud charges. The 2018 arrest of Meng, who is the Chinese telecom company's chief financial officer, embroiled Canada in a bitter dispute between the United States and China. She is accused of misrepresenting Huawei's control over another company that did business in Iran during a presentation to HSBC, putting the international bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against the country. Meng and Huawei have consistently denied the charges. Lawyers for Canada's attorney general, who represent the United States in the case, have argued that Meng's misrepresentations were part of a deliberate and co-ordinated plan that prevented HSBC from making commercial decisions based on honest and accurate information. Meng's extradition hearing is expected to wrap up next week. --- And this ... OTTAWA — An official says Canadian special forces will deploy to Afghanistan where Canadian Embassy staff in Kabul will be evacuated before it closes. The Associated Press says the official did not say how many troops would be sent. Meanwhile, the U-S government is rushing 3,000 soldiers to the Kabul airport to help with a partial evacuation of the U-S Embassy and Britain says it will send 600 troops to Afghanistan to help U-K nationals leave the country. The moves highlight the speed of the Taliban offensive, including their capture of Kandahar, the second-largest city. Some 40,000 Canadian troops were deployed in Afghanistan over 13 years as part of the NATO mission before pulling out in 2014. The first planeload of Afghan refugees who supported the Canadian military mission arrived in Canada earlier this month. A spokeswoman for Global Affairs says Canada is monitoring the situation in Afghanistan but for security reasons can't comment on specific operations. She says Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau is working closely with Canada's allies and that the security of the Canadian Embassy and its staff in Kabul is the top priority. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... LAME DEER, Mont.— Wildfires in Montana threatened rural towns and ranchland and victims of a California blaze returned to their incinerated town even as the region faced another round of dangerous weather. Firefighters and residents scrambled to save hundreds of homes as flames continued to advance on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana. Since Sunday, the fire has carved its way through some 673 square kilometres and prompted evacuation orders for thousands of people. As the fire raged across rugged hills and narrow ravines, tribal member Darlene Small helped her grandson move about 100 head of cattle to a new pasture, only to relocate them twice more as the flames from the Richard Spring fire bore down, she said Thursday. An extreme drought that’s blanketing the West has made matters worse by stunting vegetation untouched by fire. “They’ve got to have pasture where there’s water. If there’s no water, there’s no good pasture,” Small said. Gusts and low humidity were creating extreme fire behavior as flames devoured brush, short grass and timber, fire officials said. The same conditions turned California's Dixie Fire into a furious blaze that last week burned down much of the small town of Greenville in the northern Sierra Nevada. The fire that began a month ago has destroyed some 550 homes. On Thursday, residents were trying to cope with the magnitude of the losses. “Everything that I own is now ashes or twisted metal. That’s just all it is,” said Greenville resident Ken Donnell, who escaped with just the clothes on his back. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... KABUL — Afghanistan’s rapidly-advancing Taliban insurgents entered a western provincial capital, an official said Friday, hours after they captured the country’s second and third largest cities in a lightning advance just weeks before America is set to end its longest war. The seizure of Kandahar and Herat marks the biggest prizes yet for the Taliban, who have taken 12 of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals as part of a weeklong blitz. While Kabul itself isn’t directly under threat yet, the losses and the battles elsewhere further tighten the grip of a resurgent Taliban, who are estimated to now hold over two-thirds of the country and continue to press their offensive. Thousands of Afghans have fled their homes amid fears the Taliban will again impose a brutal, repressive government, all but eliminating women’s rights and conducting public executions. Peace talks in Qatar remain stalled, though diplomats are still meeting. The latest U.S. military intelligence assessment suggests Kabul could come under insurgent pressure within 30 days and that, if current trends hold, the Taliban could gain full control of the country within a few months. The Afghan government may be forced to pull back to defend the capital and just a few other cities in the coming days if the Taliban maintain momentum. Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the Afghan army has rotted from within due to corruption and mismanagement, leaving troops in the field poorly equipped and with little motivation to fight. The Taliban, meanwhile, have spent a decade taking control of large swaths of the countryside, positioning themselves to rapidly seize key infrastructure and urban areas once President Joe Biden announced the U.S. withdrawal. --- On this day in 1992 ... A Manitoba court ruled that mandatory Christian prayer in the province's schools was unconstitutional. Manitoba was Canada's last bastion of compulsory school prayer. --- In entertainment ... Projectors began lighting up the big screens at many Cineplex Inc. movie theatres over the spring, but Canada's biggest cinema chain still faced another quarter of deep losses. The impact of theatre closures from the COVID-19 pandemic and moviegoers still cautious to return to multiplexes continued to wreak havoc on the company's financial results in the second quarter as it lost $103.7 million. Cineplex also introduced a ticket price increase across the country, which chief executive Ellis Jacob told The Canadian Press was ""about three per cent, on average."" That would amount to nearly 50 cents extra for a regular ticket at one of the Toronto locations, though Jacob pointed out the price could be less substantial in other parts of the country. It could also be more for premium tickets, such as Imax or VIP theatre screenings. The decision was made to ""kind of offset operating costs — all of the costs have gone up,"" Jacob said of running the business amid a pandemic. ""It was basically early spring that we started to look at it because we were looking at costs and we were looking at where things stood and we haven't taken a price increase for a while."" --- ICYMI ... More than 17,000 years ago, a woolly mammoth roamed enough of the Alaskan landscape to circle the Earth twice. That's according to a new paper from an international team of researchers who retraced the lifetime of one of the extinct ancient Arctic creatures. The mammoth's story is written in its tusk through tiny isotopes, which are tiny atoms, said Mat Wooller, a paleoecologist at the University of Alaska. ""Isotopes are like a little chemical GPS (global positioning system) recorder,"" Wooller said. Looking at the isotopes, researchers analyzed 400,000 microscopic data points in a two-metre long woolly mammoth tusk found in Alaska in 2018. They were able to determine the animal was a male who lived to be 28 years old, he said. The way the tusk grows makes it easier to analyze, said Clement Bataille, a University of Ottawa researcher who also worked on the project. Each year, new layers grow on the mammoth's tusk, ""as if we you were stacking a bunch of ice cream cones on top of each other,"" he said. The isotopes found in the mammoth's tusk were matched with maps created by analyzing the teeth of hundreds of small rodents across Alaska. That data set was then used as a baseline to trace the mammoth's movements across Alaska. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 13, 2021 Subject: Fires; Evacuations & rescues; Pandemics; Diplomatic & consular services; Military withdrawals; Coronaviruses; Prime ministers; COVID-19"

"2021-08-15","Full text: S&P/TSX composite down, U.S. stock markets up TORONTO - Weakness in commodity prices led to a down day for Canada's main stock index, while U.S markets saw modest gains on a low-volume summer trading day. Greg Taylor, chief investment officer of Purpose Investments, said Thursday was a typical summer day where markets were waiting to be given a sense of direction. “It really does feel like the market’s waiting for something,” said Taylor. “We’re at a holding period where the market’s at all time highs, and there’s a lot of concerns about what comes next whether it’s actions from the U.S. Federal Reserve on adjusting interest rates or with the virus whether there’s a fourth wave, and it’s keeping a lot of people on the sidelines.” The S&P/TSX composite index was down 33.41 points at 20,520.60, with its materials and gold indices weighing heavily. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 14.88 points at 35,499.85. The S&P 500 index was up 13.13 points at 4,460.83, while the Nasdaq composite was up 51.12 points at 14,816.26. As speculation around a possible election heats up In Canada, Taylor said investors should be aware that a federal election campaign could create volatility, as could the entrance of a majority government with more freedom to affect policy. “Markets generally don’t like uncertainty, so if it is an election that becomes closer than some people think, that could weigh on expectations for the market,” he said. “There’ll be questions around what spending is going to be on, what promises are made, what sectors are going to benefit and which ones are going to be hurt.” Meanwhile, commodities had a weak day on Thursday after a strong day Wednesday off a weakening U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar fell back slightly on Thursday to 79.87 cents US compared with 79.96 cents US on Wednesday. The December gold contract was down US$1.50 at US$1,751.80 an ounce and the September copper contract was down less than a penny at US$4.36 a pound. Taylor said it was interesting to watch the continued disconnect between gold and cryptocurrencies, which have had a notable run over the past month. Bitcoin was up around 35 per cent on the month as of Thursday afternoon, although it faltered on the day with a drop of 3.91 per cent in the 24 hours preceding the afternoon. The September crude oil contract was down 16 cents at US$69.09 per barrel and the September natural gas contract was down 12.6 cents at US$3.93 per mmBTU. Investors should watch whether growing Delta variant cases of COVID-19 affect air travel numbers, Taylor said, as that could add downward pressure on the price of oil. In second quarter earnings, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. posted a strong quarter with increased revenues, but still saw its stock sink 1.37 per cent to $70.89 in what Taylor said was a sign of a “tired” market. “To me it feels a bit like a sell on news more than anything else,” said Taylor. “There was really not a big follow-through buy on the back of (strong numbers), and I think that’s another sign the market is getting close to exhaustion.” Other notable Canadian companies that reported quarterly earnings Thursday included Canadian Tire Corp., which saw it’s stock remain fairly level at a gain of 0.07 per cent after reporting a 20 per cent increase in revenue compared to last year.

During a special meeting June 22, town council decided to delay negotiations on the formula until after the upcoming municipal election. MD councillors indicated during their July 13 meeting that they would like to continue mediation and a letter of request was sent to the town. Town council discussed the matter during the Aug. 4 committee of the whole meeting.

""The latest national surveillance data indicate that a fourth wave is underway in Canada and that cases are plotting along a strong resurgence trajectory,"" Tam said during a federal COVID-19 update. ""Nationally, there are now over 13,000 active cases — more than double from two weeks ago."" The new wave is being driven by the much more infectious Delta variant, though she added the vast majority of new cases are among unvaccinated segments of the population. Polls suggest it's far from certain the Liberals can regain a majority but Trudeau is gambling that general satisfaction with his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic — and the unprecedented billions doled out in emergency aid — will propel them to a majority. The Liberals, who need 170 seats for a majority, currently have 155 seats in the 338-seat House of Commons. The Conservatives have 119 while the Bloc Québécois have 32, the NDP 24 and the Greens have two. There are also five Independents and one seat is vacant. Opposition parties have blasted the idea of an early election and accused the Liberals of sending Canadians to the polls during the pandemic for the sole purpose of trying to win a majority, a move they describe as unnecessary and reckless. “Fighting the pandemic and delivering for people should be a prime minister’s No. 1 priority,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said in a statement. “Instead, Mr. Trudeau has made his priority this selfish summer election and a try for a power grab.” Singh wrote Simon shortly after her installation as governor general last month urging her to reject any request from Trudeau to dissolve Parliament and force an election during the pandemic. Asked if an election should happen now given the fourth wave, Tam said: “It’s not my role to advise on whether an election should occur or not. The role of the public health agencies is to provide guidance should an election take place, and how to do that safely.”"
"2021-08-15","Full text: N.S. health-care system 'complete failure': Tories HALIFAX - Nova Scotia's Tory leader stuck to the main theme of his election campaign Thursday, condemning the province's health-care system after a Halifax-area man in his 80s waited three hours with a broken hip for an ambulance. ""Nova Scotia has been in a health-care crisis for too long and today I am here to tell you … we are nearing, if not already past, the point of disaster,"" Tim Houston told reporters Thursday, a few days ahead of the Aug. 17 election. ""There isn't a single problem to fix but a chain of failures."" Years of inaction from Liberal governments led to 86-year-old Ross O’Brien being left on his driveway in Dartmouth, N.S., earlier this week with a broken hip while he waited for emergency services, the Progressive Conservative leader said. Health-care has been the Tories' core issue during the election campaign. Houston has repeatedly attacked the Liberals, who have been in power since 2013, for the shortage of doctors, nurses and long-term care beds across the province. The Tories' plan for health care involves $430 million in new spending in the sector during the first year of their mandate. The Liberal party did not respond to a request for comment Thursday regarding O’Brien's three-hour ambulance wait. They are promising about $455 million in new spending over four years, including about $127 million for health care. Liberal Leader Iain Rankin has repeatedly said the Tories' plan dedicates too much money to health care at a time when the economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Rankin spent Thursday campaigning in and around the Halifax Regional Municipality. A re-elected Liberal government, he said, would grant $300,000 for affordable housing to a community group in the historically African Nova Scotian area of Upper Hammonds Plains. Upper Hammonds Plains was settled in 1815 by about 500 Black people after the War of 1812. The funding, Rankin said, would help the group create a community land trust to organize the housing project.

"2021-08-14","Full text: As local candidates prepare for an anticipated Federal election this month, a significant change could take place around Aurora’s municipal table as Councillor Harold Kim prepares to hit the campaign trail as the Conservative candidate for Newmarket-Aurora. The two-term Councillor, who has served as Deputy Mayor since the 2018 municipal election, secured the party’s nomination on Thursday night at the Newmarket branch of the Royal Canadian Legion. Once the election is called, Councillor Kim says he will seek a leave of absence from Council for the duration of the campaign as he faces off against incumbent Liberal Tony Van Bynen and candidates from across the political spectrum. Councillor Kim came out on top over former MP Lois Brown, who twice represented the riding in Ottawa but came up short as the party’s candidate in the last two Federal elections. Until recently, the field to challenge Van Bynen was more crowded with incumbent Aurora Councillor Rachel Gilliland in the mix, along with former broadcaster Teresa Kruze. Ms. Kruze dropped out of the race earlier this year and threw her support behind Brown, while Councillor Gilliland’s exit was more recent. “I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to Harold on his nomination,” said Councillor Gilliland. “I had stepped aside from the nomination a few weeks ago. I have a lot of unfinished business in Aurora and have been encouraged by many residents to stay at a municipal level. I look forward to continuing to serve my community and collaborating with other levels of government.” Despite her long standing as Newmarket-Aurora’s Conservative candidate, Brown was a more recent entry in the field receiving party approval to stand for the nomination in early July. This decision, she said, meant she “only had a week” to secure support from local party faithful and sell memberships, but said she was “undeterred” by the challenge. But there could only be one winner and Kim praised his predecessor while accepting the party’s nomination. “I just want to thank Lois,” said Kim after being introduced by Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill MP Leona Alleslev at the August 5 meeting. “It was a hard time in the last few weeks even thinking about Lois as an opponent because I respect her and love her very much as a fellow human being and a Conservative. She leaves behind a huge legacy.” Speaking to The Auroran the afternoon following his victory, Kim said he was “still in shock” and “absorbing” the reality of the situation. “I have a lot of work to do,” he said about speculation an election could be called as early as this week. “It doesn’t give our team much opportunity to prepare and get all the things done I would like in a timeframe we would like. I am conscious of the fact I am really going to have to hit the ground running. It’s a daunting task, but I am excited about it and the team is excited about it.” Kim says be brought not only fresh ideas to the table as a candidate, but also a “strong track record” with his Council service and a background in banking and finance. “Fiscal responsibility is very important,” he said about why he sought the Conservative nomination. “In fact, everything rolls up under finance or budgeting. Everything rolls into the fiscal ledger, whether it be environmental policy, social policy, health care, economics, trade, and I have always felt in most of my life the Conservative party was more fiscally responsible. “I think we get this stereotype that we’re cost-cutters and we cut programs. For me, fiscal responsibility means that you run surpluses when you’re in an expanding economy and you invest or spend when the economy is in recession. There’s always that balance. I don’t like the word ‘spending’ – for me, I feel like ‘investing’ in people, investing in the environment, investing in social policy because there is that investment down the road which will lead to a return for all Canadians on that investment.” “I believe in thinking long-term and unfortunately [for] a lot of people in the public and government sphere, there is the pressure of having short-term returns at the expense of having long-term gains. I believe we can take care of our budget by investing in people because there is a return on it.” Despite coming out on top in the vote count while vying for one of six seats on Aurora Council less than three years ago, Kim says he was met with a “positive response” when he announced his candidacy. He says he feels like he has made “positive contributions” to Council and he is ready to do the same in Ottawa. Once the election is underway he says he will send “formal communication” to the Town Clerk, CAO, Mayor and Council that he will be stepping down as Deputy Mayor for the duration of the campaign. “It is going to be an exciting time because the Liberals have been in power for the last six years and I think that people are ready for a fresh face and I think Canada is ready for a lot of fresh new faces, bright ideas, and have pragmatic thinking back in the mainstream again,” he says. “I think Newmarket-Aurorans have a lot to look forward to and we’ll see how the election turns out.” As for Ms. Brown, she tells the Auroran she will continue to serve the community into the future. “Congratulations to Mr. Kim on his success and I wish him well in the coming election,” she said. “It was a great honour to serve the people of Newmarket-Aurora as their Member of Parliament and I thank each one for the faith and trust they have placed in me. “I will continue my involvement with the Regimental Council for the Queen’s York Rangers, St. John’s Ambulance Council York Region, and as Vice Chair of an international charity.

"2021-09-22","Full text: The Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) says that although he would typically offer warm words and thanks to any outgoing politician, he can’t and won’t offer any words of appreciation for the time Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister has spent in office. “While we as political leaders always attempt to thank outgoing leaders for their years of service, unfortunately, in this case, we at the AMC cannot,” AMC Grand Chief Arlen Dumas said in a Tuesday statement released just hours after Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister announced he will not seek re-election and will step away from his role as leader of the province. The now outgoing premier outraged Indigenous leaders back in July when he made remarks in a press conference defending colonialism after statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth were toppled on Canada Day in Winnipeg and the premier has had an often contentious relationship with First Nations organizations in this province. “While we always wish to be respectful and diplomatic, the hurt our citizens faced and still face by repeatedly hearing his comments remains far too raw and for that reason, we cannot truly thank the Premier as he steps aside,” Dumas said. Dumas claimed that during Pallister’s time in office, First Nations groups have not been able to form meaningful partnerships with the premier or the ruling PC government. “The AMC and member First Nations have worked tirelessly throughout Pallister’s time in government to seek a respectful and collaborative partnership to no avail,” Dumas said. “It has been a challenging half-decade, to say the least. “We as First Nations are hopeful for what the future brings. We immediately call upon the incoming Premier to reopen communication, consultation and respect towards First Nations in Manitoba.” Manitoba Metis Federation President David Chartrand said in a phone interview with the Winnipeg Sun on Wednesday that the next leader of the Manitoba PCs should “take a page and learn what not to do” when it comes to leading the party, and dealing with First Nations and Métis people. “If you’ve learned what not to do from Mr. Pallister then you have a chance to be premier again in this province, but to take the Pallister ‘my way or the highway’ approach is not going to work with Manitobans, and it’s not going to work with Conservatives,” Chartrand said. “It does not work to just go at everything alone and have that dictatorial style of governing.” Chartrand is now asking the next premier of the province to step up and work collaboratively with the Manitoba Metis Federation and with Métis people in the province. “There is going to be a lot of work that needs to be done between the new leader and the Métis if we want to rebuild that relationship and at this point, you have to ask yourself ‘how does the next leader repair this damage?’” Southern Chiefs Organization (SCO) Grand Chief Jerry Daniels said that the announcement that Pallister will step down “could not come any sooner.” “SCO is pleased to hear confirmation that Premier Brian Pallister will not stand for re-election and will stand down as premier before the end of his second term,” Daniels said in a Wednesday statement. ""We’ve been calling on the premier to show leadership in resigning for quite some time now, so we’re quite happy to hear that’s what’s going to be happening. SCO's hope is to have leadership who will take bold action in partnering with First Nations.” Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) acting grand chief Shirley Ducharme also responded to Pallister’s announcement. “On behalf of MKO, we are pleased to hear confirmation that Brian Pallister will not seek re-election for the position of Premier of Manitoba,” Ducharme said in a Tuesday statement. “We look forward to working with a leader who is fully committed to truth and reconciliation and working with First Nations in a good way.” — Dave Baxter is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the Winnipeg Sun.

"2021-08-14","Full text: Progressive Party of Ontario nomination candidate, Stella Ambler, has filed an application in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice seeking to overturn the party's appointment of Collingwood Mayor Brian Saunderson to be the party's candidate for the 2022 provincial election. The provincial seat for Simcoe-Grey is currently held by Jim Wilson, who resigned from the PC caucus in 2018 and has announced he will not be running for re-election. Ms. Ambler announced in November 2020, that she would be seeking the nomination. She is a former Member of Parliament representing Mississauga South as a member of the Conservative Party from 2011 to 2015, and has lived in Wasaga Beach since 2020. The PC party announced on June 4, that Mr. Saunderson has been named as the candidate for the riding of Simcoe-Grey for the upcoming election. The announcement was made by Ontario Premier Doug Ford. There was no party member vote in the riding. Mr. Saunderson has served in municipal politics since 2014 and was elected as the Mayor of Collingwood in 2018. “The PC Party claims to have the power to appoint the candidate in Simcoe-Grey,” Ms. Ambler said in a statement. “My position is that they do not have that power, and this is what we will be arguing in court. The PC Party has no authority to circumvent the democratic process in this riding,” adding that “under our party’s constitution, the PC party members in Simcoe-Grey are the only ones who are entitled to select their PC Party candidate for the next election.” Ms. Ambler was one of four party-approved candidates running for the PC nomination in the riding. In her court application, Ms. Ambler argues that PC Party official exceeded their authority in making the appointment and that they did not follow the rules of the PC Party constitution. She claims that in cancelling the nomination meeting and appointing someone to be the candidate, the party violated its own constitutional requirement to have an open, public, and democratic nomination process. For their part, PC Party officials are relying on a rule that the PC Party Executive passed in January 2020. Section 6.5 of the Rules Governing Candidate Nominations purportedly allows the PC Party’s Provincial Nomination Committee, under instructions from the Leader, to “appoint” up to ten candidates for the upcoming Ontario election. Ms. Ambler, however, maintains that this new rule, passed only by the executive and not approved by the PC membership, is contrary to the PC Constitution, which is the supreme governing document of the Ontario PC Party. When contacted for a statement regarding his appointment as the PC's candidate and the court challenge, Mayor Saunderson declined to give an opinion on the issue, stating, “this matter is before the courts and involves Ms. Ambler and the Ontario PC Party. I have no comment.” Subject: Provincial elections; Nominations; Political appointments; State court decisions"

"2021-08-14","Full text: Albertans will have an opportunity this fall to make their voices heard regarding equalization and daylight saving time during the fall municipal elections. Albertans will be asked to vote on these two topics, as well as electing nominees to the Senate when they go to vote. Premier Jason Kenney said in a statement, he wished to encourage Albertans to get engaged on the topics and have their say. “Alberta has a long and proud tradition of grassroots, direct democracy. We will renew that tradition this fall… I look forward to taking part in the debate this fall.” The discussions will revolve around whether Albertans believe the principle of equalization payments should be removed from the Constitution, and whether the practise of changing the clocks for daylight savings should cease. According to a release from the province, Albertans have contributed more than $400 billion more to the nation than they have received in federal spending over the last 25 years. The release adds the current program requires contributions from the province to grow automatically with the national economy, regardless of localized economic challenges. Regarding daylight savings time, the idea is to shift to permanent “summer hours.” Service Alberta put forth a survey in 2019, asking Albertans if they would be in favour of the shift. According to the province’s release, more than 141,000 responded, with 91 per cent in favour. “Changing our clocks twice a year is something that every Albertan has an opinion on,” said Minister of Service Alberta, Nate Glubish. As Alberta first adopted daylight saving time following a referendum in 1971, we owe it to Albertans to give them the same opportunity to make their voices heard now that we are considering another change.” The Senate elections that will fall alongside municipal elections, and the referendum questions this fall will see three nominees elected to represent the province. One for each of the current Senate vacancies, and one in case of an early retirement. The vote on the daylight savings change, equalization payments, and Senate nominees with occur on October 18 in conjunction with municipal elections.

"2021-08-14","Full text: Jagmeet Singh joins N.S. NDP on campaign trail HALIFAX - Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tried to boost the political fortunes of provincial NDP Leader Gary Burrill on Wednesday by making a stop on the Nova Scotia election campaign trail. The Nova Scotia Liberals used the same strategy on July 13, days before Liberal Premier Iain Rankin called the provincial election. Rankin stood next to Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Halifax to announce a major deal for child care in the province. But not all visits by federal counterparts are created equal, says Cape Breton University political science professor Tom Urbaniak. ""It works for the NDP, it somewhat works for the Liberals and it absolutely does not work for the Tories,"" Urbaniak in a recent interview. The close alignment between the provincial and federal NDP makes an appearance from Singh a boon for the party in the last few days of the election, scheduled for Aug. 17. ""Jagmeet Singh brings name recognition,"" Urbaniak said. ""His level of profile, and indeed his reputation across the country, has been growing, to some extent, since the last election."" Nova Scotia's Progressive Conservatives, meanwhile, have made it clear they want little to do with Conservative Party of Canada Leader Erin O'Toole, who hasn't made an appearance during the campaign. Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Houston has distanced his party from the federal Conservatives. In March, Houston said it ""wasn't helpful"" when federal party members rejected a resolution declaring the Tories recognize ""climate change is real."" In an emailed statement, Nova Scotia Tory spokesperson Catherine Klimek said the party isn't aware of the plans of any federal leader to campaign in the province. ""We will not be campaigning with any federal leader. We are focused on improving health care in Nova Scotia,"" Klimek wrote. Burrill and Singh were in Halifax Wednesday to discuss the need for a national universal pharmacare program. A quarter of prescriptions written in Nova Scotia aren’t filled because residents can't afford to pay the cost of medication, Burrill said. Singh told reporters the federal NDP is prepared to work with the provincial branch of the party to improve access to prescription drugs. Burrill's party is promising free birth control to anyone who doesn't have private insurance and to expand coverage for HIV prevention medication and the vaccine against shingles. Urbaniak said visits by a federal party leader are more complicated for the Liberals. Though the federal and provincial Liberals are aligned politically, Rankin and his short tenure as premier could be overshadowed by Trudeau, Urbaniak explained. He said Trudeau's child-care announcement ""allowed Iain Rankin to share the stage with the prime minister to take some credit for that, even though the lion's share of the funding for that is federal funding,"" he said of the $605-million deal. Rankin, however, hasn't had much chance to showcase his abilities as a leader and runs the risk of getting absorbed into the federal Liberals' image, Urbaniak said. ""Nova Scotians will expect their premier, regardless of party stripe, regardless of party affiliation, (to) be a champion and a defender and sometimes a crusader for Nova Scotia, even if that means confronting a federal government of the same party stripe."" Urbaniak called the upcoming election ""fluid,"" adding there is a significant amount of room for surprises once voting gets underway next week. A recent poll from Narrative Research backs up that claim, finding that the gap between the Nova Scotia Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives is narrowing. The polling agency said that in May, the Liberals were at 52 per cent support compared to 24 per cent for the Tories and 19 per cent for the NDP. But new polling puts the Liberals at 40 per cent, the Tories at 31 per cent and the NDP at 27 per cent.

The not-for-profit society, which was formed in 2007 to promote hiking, walking and snowshoeing in Nova Scotia, is becoming a growing force with growing needs. Over the past year, its membership has increased by 20 per cent, according to its president, Janet Barlow. “Trail use went up dramatically during the pandemic,” she said in a news release. “But funding and support, not so much. With increased use comes increased maintenance and repair costs.” The app, AllTrails, lists 663 hiking, running and mountain biking trails in Nova Scotia. In the release, the group says that numerous trails are at risk due to a lack of funding for maintenance. Many of the local trails are managed by volunteer groups who are struggling to keep up with maintenance. At the same time, wilderness areas need further protection. In the last year, the government contributed $1.222 million towards trail funding. The province offers a number of funding options available to community groups through the Nova Scotia Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage fund. Over the past year, it has served up $88,000 for trail maintenance, $80,000 for Community Trails Leadership, $24,000 in engineering assistance, $70,000 for the Nova Scotia Trails Strategy and another $960,000 for Recreational Trail Expansion. In the release, Hike Nova Scotia encouraged hikers to speak up for trails by asking candidates how they would support trails and wilderness protection if they are elected. LighthouseNOW surveyed candidates in Queens by email, including Brian Muldoon, of the Green Party, NDP candidate Mary Dahr, Liberal candidate Susan MacLeod and the PC’s Kim Masland. Muldoon told LighthouseNOW of the Green Party’s commitment to “build communities that are sustainable, equitable, where everyone can thrive. “Within a 10-minute walk from your community, you will have access to well-maintained parks and trails,” he responded. Dahr noted the NDP has introduced an Environmental Bill of Rights that will give communities more control over projects in the area which would help with applying for funding for trail maintenance. “Protecting Nova Scotia’s natural places that bring tourists from all over the world to our rural communities is very important. The NDP would protect all of our parks and protected areas,” she said. “Upon forming government, the PCs will develop a provincial active transportation strategy and explore options to help deliver more active transportation options, such as walking trails, cycling paths and other forms of active mobility. Our platform also commits to introducing the toughest littering penalties in Canada, which will further protect our trails,” responded Masland. MacLeod said she believed that the Nova Scotia trail systems are “a vital part of Nova Scotia’s infrastructure, providing a safe and healthy way to enjoy the outdoors while benefiting from much-needed exercise … I am a firm advocate for government assistance in establishing and supporting trails both on Crown land and within communities.” Subject: Trails; Hiking; Candidates; Funding; Repair & maintenance; Elections"

Liberal riding associations have hosted nomination races in communities across the country, where there is no incumbent running, to determine who will represent the party on the ballot. A process intended to attract the best and brightest, to serve in the highest level of government, using their experience and skills gained over a lifetime of service in the public and private sector, has been fraught with secrecy and backroom dealings. It has devolved into a deeply flawed system, with party leaders often quietly calling the shots from the sidelines. Nowhere is this more obvious than Brampton.

"2021-08-13","Full text: WINNIPEG - Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister says he won't seek re-election and a new Progressive Conservative leader will be chosen before the next provincial election. Pallister, who is 67, says the decision was not easy but it was right for the party, his family and the province.

He apologized last week for saying in July that people who came to Canada before and after it became a country did not come to destroy but to build. Since then, his Indigenous relations minister resigned from cabinet, two Indigenous men quit provincial economic development boards and Indigenous leaders roundly condemned the premier.

Both Meng and Huawei deny the allegations that she misled H-S-B-C about Huawei's control over another company, putting it at risk of violating U-S sanctions against Iran. (The Canadian Press) --- (BC-Wildfires) The B-C government says it gave enough warning to residents to evacuate their homes from a wildfire in the central Interior. Rick Manwaring, the deputy minister in the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources, says the government is quite confident enough advance notice was given for residents of Monte Lake. But Victoria Cawkwell (KOK'-well), a resident of the small community, says she was caught unaware. She says she and her friends want to return to their properties, and will work to defend what remains from the wildfire. (The Canadian Press) --- (BC-Wildfires-Drones) The B-C Wildfire Service says it has encountered several drones in the past few days flying illegally over wildfires and putting the lives of firefighters at risk. The service says aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicles have been flying in restricted airspace over a complex of wildfires in the Interior. It says the area around an active wildfire has an automatic airspace restriction of five nautical miles or 9.2 kilometres around the fire and up 915 metres vertically. The wildfire service is asking anyone who sees illegal aircraft in a fire zone to report them to police, adding they can delay aerial firefighting efforts or cause deadly collisions.

"2021-08-13","Full text: SHERBROOKE – If there was only one issue that many voters in the Sherbrooke area could identify as their ‘ballot box question’ it would likely be the fate of Archibald Lake and the St. Mary’s River, regarding Atlantic Gold’s open pit mining proposal for Cochrane Hill. In 2018, community members became aware of Canada Atlantic Gold Corp’s (later bought by Australian mining firm St Barbara) plan to develop an open pit gold mine next to the river, using the lake as a water source. Since that time, an opposition movement has grown in the area known as N.O.P.E. (No Open Pit Excavation). The province’s prevacation on designating Archibald Lake as a protected wilderness area, which would put an end to any mining proposals, makes this election a focal point for N.O.P.E. proponents, local stakeholder groups and residents, including Scott Beaver. Last week, Beaver, who is an organizer of N.O.P.E, the President of the St. Mary’s River Association (SMRA), and an area resident, sent a letter to all Guysborough-Tracadie (riding which encompasses the proposes mining site) candidates and provincial party leaders, asking the following question: Do you support Atlantic Gold’s proposed open pit gold mine on Cochrane Hill in the St Mary's Municipality: Yes or No?"
"2021-08-13","Full text: MULGRAVE -- With one week to go before election day, candidates for the Guysborough-Tracadie riding gathered in Mulgrave to take part in a debate hosted by the Strait Area Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the Guysborough and Area Board of Trade. The debate saw three of the four candidates in the riding – Liberal incumbent Lloyd Hines, PC Greg Morrow and NDP Matt Stickland (Green candidate Gabriel Bruce was absent) – tackle a wide range of questions, compiled from public submissions and put to them by moderator Adam Cooke. Pandemic recovery The first question asked candidates to outline their pandemic recovery plan for businesses. Hines noted several things the Liberal government has already put in motion, such as the twinning of the TransCanada Highway, and programs to help agriculture and the creative economy. Morrow discussed party platform points like the Better Pay Cheque Guarantee and Nova Scotia Loyal, a program that rewards people for shopping and buying loyal. Stickland pointed to the NDP’s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour to put money in the pockets of consumers who could then support local businesses. Cochrane Hill mine Less than half an hour into the debate, candidates were asked if they would support or oppose Atlantic Gold’s proposed mine at Cochrane Hill in the District of St. Mary’s and protection of Archibald Lake. Morrow and Stickland reiterated the answers they had already given the St. Mary’s River Association (SMRA) on these points: ‘no’ to mining and ‘yes’ to protection (see article in this edition of The Journal)."

"2021-08-13","Full text: Manitoba's Pallister says he won't run again BRANDON, Man. - Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister says he won't seek re-election and a new Progressive Conservative leader will be chosen before the next provincial election. ""After almost 10 years as leader of our party and more than five years as our province's premier, I believe that now is the time for a new leader and a premier to take our province forward,"" Pallister said Tuesday during a caucus retreat in Brandon, Man. Pallister, 67, said the decision was not easy but it was right for the party, his family and the province. ""I don’t think there’s a better time than now for me to step aside."" Pallister hinted for nearly a year that he might leave office before the next election, which is slated for October 2023, and said he was staying on to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Pressure for his exit recently began to mount after he came under fire for comments he made about Canadian history. He apologized last week for saying in July that people who came to Canada before and after it became a country did not come to destroy but to build. Since then, his Indigenous relations minister resigned from cabinet, two Indigenous men quit provincial economic development boards and Indigenous leaders roundly condemned the premier. Some Progressive Conservative caucus members have also distanced themselves from Pallister's remarks. NDP Opposition Leader Wab Kinew said he believes those comments are the reasons for Pallister's departure and criticized the premier for ""quitting during the pandemic."" ""It's not just been about Mr. Pallister. It's been the entire PC caucus and his party that has supported his decision every step of the way that has caused Manitobans so many problems these past few years,"" Kinew said. Grand Chief Arlen Dumas of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said he would not be thanking the premier for his years of service. ""While we always wish to be respectful and diplomatic, the hurt our citizens faced and still face by repeatedly hearing his comments remains far too raw, and for that reason, we cannot truly thank the premier as he steps aside,"" Dumas said in a statement. Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, which represents northern First Nations,also welcomedPallister's departure. The organization has previously said the premier's apology did not go far enough to repair relationships with Indigenous communities. Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont said it is clear Pallister was stepping aside under pressure but wished him and his family a happy retirement. ""Ultimately when it comes to politics we are opponents and not enemies. Politics is a tough business,"" Lamont said. Tuesday's announcement now sets off movement within the party to find a new leader. Pallister has not indicated if he will stay on as a member of the legislature or if an interim leader will be needed until a new one is chosen. Progressive Conservative Party President Tom Wiebe said the executive council will meet in the coming days to determine leadership contest rules. The party’s constitution states the next leader is to be chosen by all party members on a one-member, one-vote basis. ""I would like to thank Premier Pallister for all he has done for Manitobans,"" Wiebe said in a statement. ""Since becoming leader, he worked tirelessly to build our party and unite us in our efforts."" Pallister ran unopposed for leader in 2012, after spending years in provincial and federal politics, and drove his team hard to boost memberships and volunteers. His hard-driving approach won him few friends but filled the party's coffers and helped guide the Tories to the largest majority government in a century in 2016. Pallister has prided himself in not shying away from a fight. He took on public-sector unions and implemented a wage freeze as he promised to end nearly a decade of deficits. He drew ire from the Manitoba Métis Federation after cancelling a $67.5-million payment agreement that was aimed at securing the federation's support for hydroelectric developments. Pallister was re-elected with a smaller but still substantial majority in 2019, and he recorded a balanced budget in the 2019-20 fiscal year. But his popularity dropped sharply as Manitoba dealt with surging COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. At the same time, the premier faced public anger over a plan to reform the education system. Recent opinion polls have suggested Tory support has dropped far back that of the New Democrats, especially in seat-rich Winnipeg. Pallister said Tuesday he got into politics to fight against things that make life harder and fight for things that make life better. It’s not always easy or popular, he added. ""It has always been about doing the right things."" Pallister said he is confident in the Progressive Conservative team and whoever is chosen as the next leader will be poised to help the province recover from the pandemic. ""I believe that now is the time for a new leader and a premier to take our province forward,"" he said. ""The honour of my life has been serving as your premier. Manitobans have gifted me with a great privilege."" — With files from Steve Lambertand Brittany Hobson in Winnipeg This story by The Canadian Press was first published on Aug. 10, 2021.

Cape Breton University political scientist Tom Urbaniak says the outcomes are also less certain in a number of ridings because 13 incumbent candidates are not seeking re-election. Urbaniak is not predicting who will win the election but says he has a sense the situation is ""quite fluid"" for the three main political parties (The Canadian Press) --- (COVID-NB) New Brunswick is reporting eight new cases of COVID-19 -- all in the health zone experiencing an outbreak largely among young residents who are not fully vaccinated.

"2021-08-12","Full text: N.S. election 'quite fluid' ahead of Aug. 17 vote HALIFAX - As Nova Scotia's election campaign winds through its final week, political observers say there could be a number of surprises at the polls next Tuesday. While he isn't predicting any outcomes, Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, says the situation is ""quite fluid"" for the three main political parties and their leaders — Iain Rankin of the Liberals, Tim Houston of the Progressive Conservatives and Gary Burrill of the NDP. With 13 incumbent candidates not running in this election — including 11 Liberals — Urbaniak says that makes the outcomes less certain in a number of the province's 55 ridings. ""Where an incumbent is not reoffering, that's where the races become interesting,"" Urbaniak said. ""I think there will be a few surprises on election night."" Lori Turnbull, a political scientist at Dalhousie University, says there is more potential for volatility among the electorate compared to the last election because of the addition of four ridings. Preston, east of Halifax, was restored to its position as a protected riding in 2019 along with three other largely Acadian ridings after the four districts were eliminated in 2012. ""It does open things up and then it becomes a bit more of a question of what's going on in a riding and what's going on in the election overall,"" Turnbull said. Urbaniak said he wonders whether the Liberals are starting to show some signs of worry. He pointed to an unexpected policy announcement on Monday about COVID-19 vaccination passports by Rankin, which smacked of ""some improvisation."" Urbaniak noted that vaccine passports were not part of the Liberal platform and that Rankin, like the other party leaders, passed on an opportunity to talk about policy related to the novel coronavirus during a televised roundtable debate last Thursday. ""It strikes me that there is some worry within the Liberal ranks, at least to some degree,"" he said. ""They felt the need to show Iain Rankin as the premier … being decisive."" In another unusual move, Liberal Finance Minister Labi Kousoulis called reporters to his campaign headquarters on Tuesday, where he criticized the fiscal plans of the Progressive Conservatives and NDP. In particular, he zeroed in on a Tory promise to return 50 per cent of the corporate taxes paid by companies that raise workers' salaries. ""What it will do is take the burden off the largest corporations from ever having to pay another pay increase again,"" Kousoulis said. ""All future pay increases will be funded by Nova Scotia citizens."" Kousoulis told reporters the decision to hold a media session at his office was made in conjunction with party strategists. Urbaniak said that's a change from the start of the campaign, when the Liberals were happy to keep a lower profile and ""appear managerial."" ""At this late stage, they seem to have changed that strategy and they are more directly confronting their opponents and trying to draw a contrast,"" he said. Still, Turnbull thinks voter turnout will ultimately tell the tale for the parties. She said turnout could dip below 50 per cent, adding that people who choose to vote could wait until the last minute to make up their minds. ""There's not that polarizing person for everybody to get either really excited about and rally around or get really scared of and rally against,"" she said. Turnbull said the outcome will depend on how well party leaders propagate their messages and how organized and efficient party machines are in competitive ridings. Meanwhile, Elections Nova Scotia said a total of 75,367 early votes had been cast as of Monday — more than twice the number at the same point during the 2017 election, when 32,935 early votes had been cast. In the 2017 election, 756,113 people registered to vote, and 403,366 people, representing 53.4 per cent of the electorate, cast a ballot.

"2021-08-12","Full text: Vaughan, Amos among Liberal MPs not running again OTTAWA - Liberal MPs Adam Vaughan, Will Amos and Karen McCrimmon won't be running in the next federal election. That brings to 12 the number of incumbent Liberals who won't be seeking re-election. But in another sign of an imminent election call, the Liberals are wasting no time filling some of those gaps. Just hours after McCrimmon confirmed speculation that she won't run again, the party announced city councillor and deputy Ottawa mayor Jenna Sudds will take her place carrying the party banner in Kanata-Carleton. And it announced that Sophie Chatel, a career public servant and tax specialist, will take the place of Amos in Quebec's Pontiac riding. Yasir Naqvi, meanwhile, was acclaimed Monday as the Liberal candidate in Ottawa Centre, a prime piece of political real estate left open after Infrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna announced in late June that she won't run again. Naqvi represented the riding in the provincial legislature from 2007-2018. The party has not yet announced a replacement for Vaughan, whose departure puts the downtown Toronto riding of Spadina-Fort York in play. Vaughan won the newly created riding in a 2014 byelection, handily defeating former NDP MP Olivia Chow, who had previously represented Trinity-Spadina, portions of which were absorbed into the new riding. Vaughan said Monday he decided not to seek re-election after spending 15 years in politics. He wants to spend more time with his family after turning 60. He said he made the ""tough decision"" after reflecting on the work he will have to do to achieve progress on files including the national housing strategy, and he found that he cannot do that at ""half speed."" ""The job is not just intellectually and spiritually demanding. It's also physically demanding,"" he said in an interview with The Canadian Press. ""I've been doing announcements for the last week — up at 5 every morning going off to airports and then driving for four or five hours to do a half-hour announcement, to get back in the car to get to the airport to get to the next city."" The intensity of being an MP has taken a toll on him, he said, especially with a political culture where, sometimes, the priority has become shaming people rather than explaining policies. ""We live in an environment of gotcha politics and it's not just … the opposition that plays that game, it's journalists who play that game too, and it's a political culture that you can see on social media,"" he said. ""It's never about the ideas. It's about the person and that's a little disappointing … Politics is getting more caustic and more vitriolic."" Vaughan was a Toronto city councillor for the Trinity-Spadina area between 2006 and 2014. Toronto Catholic District School Board trustee Norm Di Pasquale will run for the NDP in Vaughan's riding. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is widely expected to call an election soon as his cabinet ministers and MPs are criss-crossing the country making campaign-style announcements. Amos, who has represented Pontiac since 2015, said in a post on Facebook that he will not be running after discussing his options with his family. ""I'm not closing the door to politics and elected public service in the future. But I have concluded that the time is not right for me to launch into another campaign,"" he said. ""I want to explore other avenues that enable better life/work balance."" Last month, Amos's office said he is pursuing a ""wellness program"" after twice exposing himself during virtual proceedings in the House of Commons, incidents he described as accidental. In May, Amos was caught on camera urinating — which was broadcast on an internal parliamentary video feed of Commons proceedings but not seen publicly — after he appeared naked in April during similar virtual proceedings, which he said occurred as he changed clothes after taking a jog. In a post on her Twitter account, McCrimmon said she will not seek re-election in Kanata-Carleton due to ""health challenges"" that require her attention, noting that she was not forced to take this step. ""At the age of 64, it is time to make my health a priority,"" she said. ""I acknowledge that the timing is undeniably difficult. I am also acutely aware and not insensitive to the fact that this will impact others, but I feel that to delay further would not be in the best interests of the people of Kanata-Carleton."" Conservative candidate Jennifer McAndrew has already started canvassing with her team in a bid to win back the riding, which her party lost to McCrimmon in 2015.

"2021-08-12","Full text: Two more key officials depart Green Party OTTAWA - A pair of top officials are departing the Greens as financial strain and internal strife continue to take a toll on the party ahead of a likely election this year. Leader Annamie Paul's interim chief of staff Phil Spidle was laid off by party brass last week, the latest casualty in cuts that have halved the Green staff, according to two senior sources who were not authorized to speak publicly about payroll matters. Spidle, who headed Paul's leadership campaign last year and worked with the Greens for the past two decades, was on paid leave throughout the summer while he engaged in drawn-out negotiations for a contract to become national campaign director. The talks were with Doug Tingey, who oversaw the party purse strings until the last couple days, when he abruptly stepped down — the second major departure in less than a week. Tingey, who was re-elected to a two-year term last month as president of the Green Party of Canada Fund, said in an interview Monday it was ""an appropriate time"" to resign, but declined to offer a reason. ""I’d like them to get through what they're going through at this point."" He has said the Greens' financial situation is not sustainable, with party executives opting to withhold $250,000 in funding earmarked for Paul's riding campaign in Toronto Centre, according to four party sources. The party is poised to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal battles with Paul, heightening acrimony and worsening an already weak cash balance in spite of increased year-over-year fundraising under her 10-month tenure. At a meeting of the Greens' federal council last month, executives of the party said it spent about $100,000 on legal fees in July, with another $100,000 earmarked for legal expenditures in August, according to two party sources not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The past weeks also saw Paul start an arbitration related to her employment contract and moves by party brass to oust her through a non-confidence vote and a membership suspension — both were halted by the independent arbitrator. In response, several senior officials launched a legal challenge on behalf of the party against Paul that questioned the arbitrator's decision, racking up further costs. The party has not been able to confirm whether the leader will speak at its first general meeting in three years, which kicks off on Aug. 19, as power struggles and turmoil threaten to overshadow Green campaign efforts in an election expected in the next couple months.

"2021-08-11","Full text: N.S. Liberals would implement vaccine passport HALIFAX - With Nova Scotia's Aug. 17 election just over a week away, Liberal Leader Iain Rankin promised Monday to introduce a COVID-19 vaccination passport system if elected. Rankin told reporters that although the so-called ""ScotiaPass"" would not be mandatory, it would provide businesses such as restaurants and bars with a tool to help keep their patrons safe. The Liberal promise follows last week's announcement by Quebec Premier Francois Legault that his government would impose a vaccine passport system to curb the spread of COVID-19. Rankin said details on how the system would work are to come, but the idea is to get ahead of a potential fourth wave of COVID-19 while case numbers remain low in the province. As of Monday, Nova Scotia had 16 active cases of novel coronavirus. ""Quebec is doing it as their cases are rising,"" Rankin said. ""We are doing it in advance of a possible surge."" Rankin said that while the plan is to have a system that is voluntary for businesses, he hinted at possible stronger steps, saying a Liberal government would ""do whatever it has to do"" to keep the public safe in the event of a surge of the virus. The announcement was the first COVID-related policy initiative put forward by any of the parties in the provincial election. Rankin dismissed the idea that the Liberals are politicizing the province's public health response by making a campaign promise. ""I think Nova Scotians want to know which party is going to continue with the path that we have been on over the last 16 months,"" he said. When asked about the Liberal proposal, Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Houston told reporters that he didn't want to ""politicize people's fear,"" adding that his party would take guidance from public health officials. ""I think Nova Scotians have a right to know and should feel comfortable that I'll work with the experts,"" Houston said. The Tory leader did say he contacted chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang last week to ask him about the idea of a vaccination passport. The party later released the email correspondence in which Strang said some sort of vaccine passport is under ""active consideration."" However, he told the Tories that because the province is in an election period, he wouldn't be sharing any information with any of the political parties. ""We will be bringing forward information and recommendations to the new government after the Aug. 17 election,"" Strang wrote. In an emailed statement, the NDP said it supports ""exploring any measures"" to keep people safe, including improved immunization records. The party said it would increase supports to ensure as many people as possible get vaccinated, including paid sick time. Meanwhile, Houston highlighted a platform promise to directly fund about 40 per cent of the cost of fertility treatments for people who want to become parents. The Tories propose allowing people toclaim a maximum of $20,000 in eligible costs, with a cap of $8,000 a year. Houston pointed out that unlike neighbouring Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, Nova Scotia does not offer assistance for couples struggling to conceive. ""We are pro-population growth,"" he said. ""It's the right thing to do to support families, and it's smart government policy."" Also Monday the NDP released its costed election platform, saying it would spend $151 million during its first year in power for initiatives such as affordable housing, mental health care, child care and long-term care. On their big-ticket items, the New Democrats are pledging $158.4 million over four years to build 1,000 community housing units and $386 million for new and replacement long-term care beds. The party said that much of those capital costs would be shared with the federal and municipal levels of government. The Liberal platform estimates the party's promises at $454.7 million over four years, of which$93.2 million would be spent in the first year of their mandate. The Progressive Conservatives are projecting $553 million in new spending during their first year in office, including $430 million for the health-care sector.

"2021-09-22","Full text: The International Day of Indigenous Peoples, celebrated on Aug. 9, was established in 1994 by the United Nations General Assembly. This year it has as its theme, “Leaving no one behind: Indigenous peoples and the call for a new social contract.” As far as Anishinabek Nation Grand Council Chief Reg Niganobe is concerned, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 Calls to Action is a social contract in Canada, and stronger yet are the treaties, he says. “The contracts themselves already exist in terms of treaties and other obligations the governments are technically supposed to have, but we're not seeing the benefit of that at the current time in my opinion,” said Niganobe. Six days before the world marked the International Day of Indigenous Peoples, Curve Lake and Hiawatha First Nations, members of the Anishinabek Nation in Ontario, observed Aug. 3 as a Day of Mourning. That date was the 215th day of the year and honoured the 215 unmarked graves uncovered by Tk'emlúps te Secwe̓pemc Nation on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia. Only weeks after Tk'emlúps te Secwe̓pemc unveiled its numbers, leadership of Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan said ground penetrating radar on the site of the Marieval Indian Residential School indicated 751 probable burials. Niganobe is hoping that the physical findings of unmarked graves are an awakening for the country. “I think it's unfortunate that it takes events like this to kind of come forward before a lot of that movement takes place,” he said. Niganobe points out that the TRC report on the legacy of the residential school system included a volume on lost children and unmarked graves in the report it released in 2015. “You look at those reports and you do have all those potential avenues to take. It’s a matter of just addressing them,” he said. “We do have existing agreements which some people call contracts (and) we call them treaties,” said International Chief Wilton Littlechild of Maskwacis in Alberta. Littlechild says Canada does not need a “new social contract.” He points to existing agreements, which include treaties; the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), with the federal government recently passing a bill for its implementation; the 94 Calls to Action delivered by the TRC in 2015; and the 231 Calls for Justice that came in 2019 from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). “You've got four at least in Canada; solutions calling out for implementation. And if that's done, I'm not sure we need a new social contract or social agreement,” said Littlechild. He was one of three commissioners with the TRC and has been active for decades at the international and national levels working for the rights of Indigenous peoples, including holding key roles for the UN on human rights and Indigenous rights. “Those are solutions that are there that all need just to be implemented. I shouldn't say ‘just’ because it's not that easy. Had they been implemented already I think we'd be farther ahead than where we are today,” he said. But nothing short of political will and individual commitments will make these social contracts happen, he says. And the implementation of Calls to Action 53 through 56, which directs the creation of a National Council for Reconciliation (NCR). “The purpose of that was … to be an independent oversight body to check on what exactly is going on across Canada. So where there's good practices we can learn from each other. Where there isn't any action, to question why there's no action,” said Littlechild, who was one of three commissioners on the TRC. He adds that the NCR could also be an independent oversight body for the MMIWG’s Calls for Justice, considering both the TRC and MMIWG national inquiry call for the implementation of UNDRIP. “Had (the NCR) been in place three to four years ago even, one or two years after our report, we would have been further ahead with respect to reconciliation, with respect to enforcement of treaties, the Calls for Justice, implementation of the declaration. They all seem to merge into one solution and that's implementation… We have the solutions in place. We just need to activate them,” said Littlechild. As for the delay on the creation of the NCR, Littlechild, who was chair of the interim committee to look at establishing the NCR, knows only that they turned in their report to the government in June 2018. The Crown-Indigenous Relations’ website reiterates Ottawa’s commitment to establishing the NCR. However, the only details offered are confirmation of the receipt of the report and the 2019 budget announcement of $126.5 million in fiscal year 2020-2021 to establish the NCR. “My own timeframe is (that it’s) long past,” said Littlechild, but “won’t say the delay has been intentional.” As for the federal legislation creating the UNDRIP Act, it sets aside two years to create an implementation plan. The legislation obligates the federal government to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with the declaration.” Littlechild says he is concerned about what will happen in moving forward with UNDRIP should the federal government call an election soon, which is strongly anticipated. “Ever since I was a Member of Parliament myself I've always felt and argued that our issues should be non-partisan,” said Littlechild, who was the first treaty First Nations person to serve as an MP, a position he held for the Progressive Conservatives in the Wetaskiwin-Rimbey riding from 1988 to 1993. “I think that we have a relationship with the Crown. It's not a political party. So I think it should be non-partisan. Indigenous issues should be a challenge to all parties to work together with us on solutions. When we become a debating point then nothing happens.” Niganobe agrees, saying all the reports that have been undertaken deal with “non-partisan issues.” He also says that Indigenous issues need to be “incredibly high” on party platforms, in both the upcoming federal election and the upcoming Ontario election. “If you can address a lot of these issues, the social contract—the economic benefits for all, the social benefits for all—you can create a lot more certainty within Canada in terms of inclusion and in terms of investment and business, just contributions from Aboriginal people in general. That inclusion could lead to bigger things for Canada,” said Niganobe. “To me, those contracts already exist. It's just an obligation on their part to start fulfilling them.” On its website, the UN points to apologies, truth and reconciliation efforts, and legislative and constitutional reforms that have been undertaken over the years by countries to address how Indigenous people have been marginalized and excluded from political and economic activities. Despite these actions, inequalities still exist. “Therefore, the building and redesigning of a new social contract as an expression of cooperation for social interest and common good for humanity and nature, is needed,” says the UN. “The new social contract must be based on genuine participation and partnership that fosters equal opportunities and respects the rights, dignity and freedoms of all. Indigenous peoples’ right to participate in decision-making is a key component in achieving reconciliation between Indigenous peoples and States,” reads the UN site. August 9 marks the day of the first meeting in 1982 of the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. The annual day was proclaimed in 1993 at the end of the Year of the World’s Indigenous Peoples. Since then, two International Decades of the World’s Indigenous Peoples were declared (1995-2004 and 2005-2014). Next year will begin the Decade of Indigenous Languages.

"2021-09-22","Full text: N.S. riding has full slate of Black candidates CHERRY BROOK, N.S. - In the provincial riding of Preston, just east of Halifax, a historic political race is underway. “One of the things that's really important, and I think so many people are talking about, is the fact that all three of us are local in particular and African Nova Scotian,” Liberal candidate Angela Simmonds said of the candidates facing off to represent the riding. Simmonds, along with NDP candidate Colter Simmonds and Progressive Conservative candidate Archy Beals, make up the slate for the largely African Nova Scotian riding in the Aug. 17 general election. It’s believed to be the first time in the province’s history an electoral district has all Black candidates. It’s thanks in part to the reinstatement two years ago of Preston, along with three largely Acadian ridings — Argyle, Clare and Richmond. In 2019, the Liberal government introduced legislation to bring back the so-called protected ridings after the previous NDP government did away with them in 2012, saying there were too few voters in them. With the reinstatement, the province once again has 55 ridings, up from 51 in the last election. Other provinces have ridings of varying sizes, typically to ensure rural voters are well represented. But Nova Scotia’s protected ridings are unique for the fact that they shield so-called “historical minorities” from redistribution, said James Bickerton, a political science professor at St. Francis Xavier University. The ridings were initially formed in the 1990s to ensure effective representation of Acadian and African Nova Scotian voters and to protect them from electoral redistribution, “which would dilute the populations considerably to the point where minorities would no longer be the majority within the constituency,” Bickerton said. He was on the electoral boundaries commission that concluded in 2012 that the ridings should remain. But he said the commission was threatened by then-attorney general Ross Landry, who claimed the recommendation did not respect the commission's terms of reference. The movement to reinstate the special districts followed a court victory by the Acadian Federation of Nova Scotia. The province's Appeal Court ruled that the redrawn map violated democratic rights guaranteed in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. “Effective representation was at play … the argument being that Francophones and African Nova Scotians could only have effective representation if they had representatives in the legislature from their communities,” Bickerton said. “Protected ridings doesn't guarantee it, but it certainly makes it much more likely.” Andrew Griffith, a fellow at the Environics Institute, a public opinion and social research organization, said ridings with large minority populations tend to elect candidates with similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds. He gave the example of Indo-Canadians. “If you look at a place that has a large Indo-Canadian population, whether immigrants or citizens, the candidates and the MPs tend to come from those communities,” Griffith said. “Having your electoral districts be aligned not only to the overall population balance, but to recognize that some communities may be relatively under-represented because they’re too dispersed across the province or across the country, I think it's a valid rationale.” Glenn Graham, a political science professor at St. Francis Xavier University, echoed the sentiment, adding that the goal of the ridings is effective representation, not necessarily absolute voter parity, which is the idea that each vote carries the same weight. Voter parity, however, could also limit the voices of minority voters, he said. When the latest changes were made in 2019, the four protected ridings had voting populations ranging from 6,451 in Argyle to 10,781 in Preston, well below the provincial average of 14,356 electors per riding. ""With all the major political parties running an African Nova Scotian candidate, it's a guarantee that there will be an African Nova Scotian representing the area,"" Beals said in a recent interview. He added that the area comes with specific cultural issues, including education and business development, of which the candidates have an intimate understanding. ""Who best to address them than someone in the community, from the community?"" he said. As for the Acadian ridings, Marie-Claude Rioux, the executive director of the Acadian Federation of Nova Scotia, said in an interview that the change ""gives Acadians a better chance to elect someone that will know their needs,"" such as French-language health services. But while the community was glad to see the three Acadian ridings restored, Rioux said the federation plans on fighting for more representation, namely a riding for Cheticamp, an Acadian community in Cape Breton. Moving toward effective representation, Graham said, is about “having someone that you feel may look like you in the legislature, or is a reflection of your lived experience in the legislature.” And with the newly reinstated ridings, Angela Simmonds said she now has an opportunity to engage with the constituents of the riding at a more personal level. ""I think when you see someone who looks like you there is an appreciation for one's lived experiences,"" she said.

"2021-09-23","Full text: Canadian and U.S. stock markets fall sharply TORONTO - Canada's main stock index suffered its biggest daily decline in nearly eight months while U.S. markets also tanked amid heightened anxieties about emerging Chinese risks, a global economic slowdown and impending Federal Reserve action. The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 335.82 points to 20,154.54 after hitting an intraday low of 19,932.19. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 614.41 points at 33.970.47. The S&P 500 index was down 75.26 points at 4,357.73, while the Nasdaq composite was down 330.07 points at 14,713.90. Investors are wary of an economic slowdown in China, with concerns Monday over the potential insolvency of Chinese property developers, particularly Evergrande, said Craig Fehr, investment strategist, Edward Jones. The fear is that a potential collapse there could send a chain reaction through the Chinese property-development industry and spill over into the broader financial system, similar to how the failure of Lehman Brothers inflamed the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession. ""All of this is ... coming at the same time that the Fed is looking to dial back some of the stimulus so that's adding a little bit to the indigestion today,"" he said in an interview. Fehr said the market movement isn't a sign of broader change in direction for the North American or global economies. Monday's Canadian election and the U.S. debt ceiling debate likely also contributed to the short-term anxiety, although he said expectations are for the Trudeau Liberals to retain power with a minority government. Markets have been a victim of their own success with equity markets surging over the past year, approaching a 20 per cent rise before the recent downturn, he said. Periodic setbacks are normal even for the strongest equity markets and the market hasn't seen the typical annual corrections in at least a year. ""I don't think this is going to snowball into something significantly severe or prolonged. But I do think it's a condition that we've been expecting for some time,"" Fehr said. Monday's market losses evoke more emotion from investors who have been spoiled by the strong gains, but the decreases probably feel worse than they really are, he added. ""The first thing investors can do on a day like this is not take the bait. Put a different way, don't panic."" All 11 major sectors on the TSX were down on the day, led by health care, energy, industrials, financials and technology. Health care dropped five per cent as cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corp. loss 7.5 per cent, followed by Aurora Cannabis Inc. down 7.3 per cent and Tilray Inc. off 6.8 per cent, Energy lost 2.8 per cent on lower crude oil and natural gas prices with Enerplus Corp. and MEG Energy Corp. down 4.8 and 4.7 per cent, respectively. The November crude contract was down US$1.68 at US$70.14 per barrel and the October natural gas contract was down 12 cents at US$4.99 per mmBTU. A 23.6 per cent decrease in New Flyer Industries Inc. shares pushed Industrials down 1.8 per cent while Hut 8 Mining Corp. lost 12.3 per cent to drag technologies 1.5 per cent lower. Lower copper prices pushed materials down even as gold was one of the few assets to gain ground. The December gold contract was up US$12.40 at US$1,763.80 an ounce and the December copper contract was down 13.2 cents at US$4.11 a pound. Fehr said it's not unusual for cyclical investments such as energy, industrials and financials to be hardest hit on days like Monday, while the loonie is a cyclical currency that underperforms when the global growth outlook weakens and crude prices fall. The Canadian dollar traded for 77.95 cents US compared with 78.61 on Friday. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 20, 2021. — With files from The Associated Press.

"2021-09-23","Full text: Quebec mayor concerned over acts of intimidation MONTREAL - A Quebec mayor is asking provincial police for assistance after a series of alleged crimes that seem to be targeting local officials. ""Right now, it's a little bit like the Wild West,"" Saint-Joseph-du-Lac Mayor Benoit Proulx said in an interview Monday, speaking out against intimidation. Proulx said there have been at least four incidents in the lower Laurentians town, northwest of Montreal, in the past two weeks. Municipal police have launched investigations after two vehicles were allegedly set on fire since Friday, including one owned by a municipal councillor and another belonging to the wife of the town's director general. Coun. Alexandra Lauzon's vehicle caught fire in her driveway on Sunday night, and Insp. Jean-Philippe Labbé of the Lac des Deux-Montagnes police force said an initial examination leads investigators to suspect arson. Two days earlier, the vehicle belonging to the wife of the town's director general also caught fire while the family was asleep. The fire spread to another vehicle belonging to the couple and to their camping trailer, which had a propane tank attached to it. ""It was close to the fire spreading to the house as well,"" director general Stéphane Giguère said in an interview, adding that a neighbour woke them up. An investigation has also been launched after the wife of another municipal councillor lost a wheel while driving on a major highway last week. Proulx said the bolts holding the wheel on had been changed and loosened. Proulx said he also received a threatening call a few weeks ago, and with the latest acts, the expertise of the provincial police is needed to help with the investigation. ""What's happening is too serious to let it continue,"" Proulx said. ""This is why I'm asking for help."" Proulx suspects whoever is responsible for the suspicious acts wants him and his fellow councillors to resign, ""just because we have the guts to do our jobs,"" he said. Municipal election campaigns officially got underway across the province on Friday, and Proulx is seeking a third mandate ""no matter what."" He does not believe his political opponents are to blame for the alleged crimes. ""I know them,"" he said. ""They could have never done something like that, direct or indirectly.""

"2021-09-23","Full text: Research is suggesting it could be a long and bumpy recovery—lasting perhaps a decade or even longer—for the Indigenous tourism industry in Canada. A Conference Board of Canada report released this past week indicated there have been some signs of an industry recovery for 2021, but it is still projecting a 54 per cent decline in direct GDP (gross domestic product) compared to levels before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Canada early last year. The Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC) commissioned the report, the third economic assessment issued on its behalf by the Conference Board of Canada since 2018. An updated analysis and inventory were done three years ago, when the Indigenous tourism industry was booming across the country. “We did an interim economic report after the first two waves, so about a year ago,” said Keith Henry, ITAC’s president and CEO. “This is an updated report we’ve been working on and we just wanted to see after three waves how bad it is.” Henry said ITAC’s original plan did not include an update in 2020 or this year. “We weren’t going to do it for a few more years,” he said. “Obviously we wanted to measure the impacts of last year. We wanted to see how serious it has been because there is just no data for Indigenous tourism in the country unless we do it.” Back in 2019, pre-pandemic, Indigenous tourism in Canada employed almost 39,000 people and brought in an estimated $1.86 billion in direct GDP. Last year, during the peak of the pandemic, Indigenous tourism only contributed about $580 million in direct GDP, almost a third of 2019 numbers. And the number of individuals employed by Indigenous tourism fell to about 10,600. The number of workers almost doubled this year to about 20,000. And there will be an estimated $858 million in direct GDP in 2021. About 350 Indigenous-owned tourism operators across Canada responded to a detailed survey between April and June of this year. Those owners were asked for their insights into what they’ve experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and what they anticipate will happen to their businesses this year and also in 2022. Henry said he was not really surprised with any of the information released in the report on Sept. 15. “It pretty much reinforced the challenges we have,” he said. But what is of further concern is found in some internal ITAC research combined with some data compiled by Destinations Canada, a Crown corporation that is responsible for the national marketing strategy worldwide. Henry said officials from Destinations Canada and its partners have compiled information to try and determine how long it will take tourism businesses to recover and get back to 2019 levels. “They expect to be back by 2024 or 2025,” Henry said. “But we’ve been hit hardest of the hard hit in tourism. We’re going to be at least until 2028 to get back to 2019 levels. So, we’re being disproportionately impacted and our businesses are disproportionately feeling the loss of business.” Henry said it could be even longer than 2028 for the Indigenous tourism industry to fully recover. “That’s best-case scenario,” he said. “But we’re probably looking at 2030.” Federal officials had announced a $500 million Tourism Relief Fund in mid-July. And 10 per cent of this fund, $50 million, was to go towards Indigenous tourism businesses. In 2020 the Canadian government had provided $16 million in funding to ITAC, which then distributed it in the form of grants of up to $25,000 each to about 700 businesses. Henry said Indigenous portions of the federal money announced in July did not go directly to ITAC for distribution. Instead, it was sent to various regional development agencies. “We don’t believe that’s going to be an effective process at all,” Henry said. “As it stands today, despite that announcement, there has not been a single Indigenous business that has been able to access that program successfully.” This year’s federal budget allocated $2.4 million to ITAC, a far cry from the $18 million it requested. Henry said that while ITAC officials are keen to continue advocating for more funding, things have been at a recent standstill. “They put all projects on hold because of the (federal) election,” he said. “We don’t have much confidence we’re going to get anything (more this year). We hope we do but we’re not confident.” Henry said ITAC officials are going to be ready to proceed with their advocacy work as soon as possible. “We’re far from getting out of this woodwork right now,” he said. “We continue to say to government, whoever gets elected on Monday, the first thing we’re going to be doing is finding out when the minister of Tourism is appointed and the minister of Indigenous Services and saying we need to act now. We cannot wait for these programs. More has got to be done. We’re going to be advocating very hard once this election is done.” Windspeaker.com Subject: Gross Domestic Product--GDP; Coronaviruses; Tourism; Pandemics; COVID-19"

And though his party has no seats and is often described as fringe, high turnout in Chatham – and other stops during the day in Sarnia, Inwood, London and Aylmer – show harnessing the ""No More Lockdowns"" sentiment has helped the PPC find support in Southwestern Ontario. Bernierwas joined by local PCC candidates Liz Vallee for Chatham-Kent-Leamington and Brian Everaert from Sarnia-Lambton. Independent MPP Randy Hillier also made the journey. Numerous chants of “PPC” and “freedom” broke out throughout the leader’s speech to go along with a steady series of honks from passing cars and trucks. Bernier also hammered the “segregation” theme, saying Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has divided Canada “by race, by gender, by religion… And now by our vaccination status.” He added since vaccinated people can still spread COVID he saw no point to a vaccine mandate, ignoring overwhelming statistics which show vaccinated people are much less likely to get seriously ill if they suffer a breakthrough infection. Bernier also claimed there will be unlimited COVID booster shots in the future. Media organizations were also targeted by the PPC leader, particularly CBC, CTV and participants in the Local Journalism Initiative. “We want the media to be independent, not dependent on the government,” says Bernier, adding that in a capitalist society if an organization cannot survive on its own it should fail.

"2021-09-20","Full text: U.S. cruise bill would hurt B.C. economy: official VANCOUVER - Two U.S. bills proposed by a congressman and senator aimed at allowing Alaska-bound cruise ships to bypass Canadian ports would have a ""devastating"" effect on British Columbia's economy, the head of Victoria's harbour authority says. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski proposed a bill Wednesday that would allow cruise ships carrying more than 1,000 passengers and bound for Alaska a permanent exemption from the Passenger Vessel Services Act. Under the act, foreign-built ships are not allowed to carry passengers between two U.S. ports without a stopover in a foreign country. ""(The act) had the unintended consequence of putting Alaskan businesses at the mercy of the Canadian government,"" she said during an address to the Southeast Conference Annual Meeting. ""It nearly wiped out southeast Alaskan economies as we saw business after business ready to welcome visitors, but unable to because Canadians would not respond to our requests to allow foreign stops at their ports to meet the requirement of PVSA. We cannot let that happen again."" Under the proposed legislation, foreign cruise ships carrying more than 1,000 passengers can bypass Canadian ports if they wish. Ian Robertson, the CEO of the Greater Victoria Harbour Authority, said the bill would hurt Victoria and British Columbia's economy. ""I'm both surprised and disappointed,"" Robertson said in an interview. ""It would be devastating."" Cruises bring in roughly $143 million a year to Victoria's economy and create hundreds of jobs, he added. But Robertson added he believes the province is taking the threat of an economic impact more seriously than it did in the spring when a bill was quickly introduced and passed in the U.S. House of Representatives aimed at adjusting the same law. Premier John Horgan initially said at the time the legislation was a ""blip"" that wasn't likely to pass quickly, before it did and he set up meetings with U.S. officials. Cruise ships were banned during the initial part of the COVID-19 pandemic over concerns about spreading the virus, but the ban is set to be lifted Nov. 1. Robertson said the next federal government needs to take the issue seriously after Monday's election. ""It's a file that requires all hands on deck,"" he said. ""There needs to be advocacy at the highest level."" Horgan said Friday that he was in discussions with Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, about the situation. ""We've worked with her to ensure the congressional delegations understood the importance to British Columbia and to the relationships between Canada and the United States, that passage not be confined to Seattle and Alaska."" He added that he would be discussing the issue with the next prime minister after Monday's election. Horgan said he's expecting to hear back from Hillman about her discussions with her American counterparts on Monday. B.C. Tourism Minister Rob Fleming said in a statement that he is working with industry leaders and his federal counterparts to raise awareness of the issue. ""The cruise ship industry is vital to B.C. tourism, and to thousands of people whose livelihoods rely on the regular arrival of ships,"" he said.

"2021-09-20","Full text: As the federal election campaign nears its end, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is fighting off criticism from progressive environmentalists by trying to shift the focus back to Justin Trudeau’s climate record. In the past week, the NDP has appeared vulnerable on the climate file. A demonstration Thursday by Climate Justice Toronto called on Singh to protect old-growth from logging at Fairy Creek. The party also recently took flak for not having a clear stand on the Trans Mountain expansion project, at the same time the Liberals have been highlighting endorsements from climate experts like Mark Jaccard and former B.C. Green Party leader Andrew Weaver. But in the days since Trudeau was in B.C. to welcome the endorsement from Weaver, the Liberals’ support has fallen in that province to the NDP’s benefit. With voters heading to the polls Monday, Singh is attempting to capitalize on the moment by stressing that when it comes to climate, the incumbent Liberals have been an “abject failure.” Singh summarized Trudeau’s climate record as the worst of any G7 country, saying the Liberals promised to end fossil fuel subsidies but increased them instead, and exempted the largest polluters from the carbon tax. Canada has a G20 commitment to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, referring to subsidies that incentivize oil and gas exploration. The Liberals have promised to end those by 2023 instead of a previous commitment of 2025. But since 2018, the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) found governments in Canada have spent at least $23 billion on three megaproject pipelines. The IISD also found that 2020 saw a 200 per cent increase in fossil fuel subsidies to the oil and gas sector. “We believe we need to fight the climate crisis with everything we have,” Singh said on Friday. “Our kids deserve it, the future deserves it, and we need to do it right now.” When asked about old-growth logging, Singh said he believes in protecting old-growth and the environment, but that the environment is not the only consideration. “I believe very deeply in protecting and conserving the environment, (but) I also believe very strongly in respecting Indigenous rights and Indigenous land rights,” he said. “I don't believe at all that it's the position of settlers to tell Indigenous communities what to do with their land,” he added. Instead, Ottawa should provide resources to Indigenous communities to help with conservation, Singh said. “Our plan would be to release $500 million in funding to truly support Indigenous communities in conservation and stewardship,” he said. “They know what to do, they have the knowledge, they have the experience, they need support, and for a long time, they've been stripped of economic resources. “We would support them in a real way,” he said. As videos of police pepper-spraying and dragging protesters at Fairy Creek went viral earlier in the campaign, the Liberal Party promised $50 million to protect old-growth. North Vancouver Liberal candidate Jonathan Wilkinson said at the time that a re-elected Liberal government wouldn’t try to assert its jurisdiction over the province, but that it would work with it. Liberal spokesperson Alex Deslongchamps said the party has a track record of delivering on promises, citing the carbon tax and increased Paris Agreement targets. “The NDP (seems) to care about climate change, but independent experts gave their climate plan an F,” he said. On Friday, Singh highlighted an endorsement of his climate plan from Protect Our Winters, which gave the party the highest ranking of the three leading parties. The NDP got an A-, Liberals got a B, and the Conservatives a D. Of the other parties, the Greens tied the NDP, the Bloc Québécois got a B-, and the People’s Party of Canada was given an F. This week, the global Climate Action Tracker analyzed countries’ updated 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and called Canada’s “highly insufficient.” That means that without increased action, Canada is on track for 4 C warming — far higher than the Paris Agreement goal of as close to 1.5 C as possible. Last month’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report estimated five scenarios, ranging from very low to very high emission growth; in the highest emission scenario, it estimated global warming at 4.4 C within 80 years. As the campaign draws to a close, the leaders are scooping up U.S. endorsements. Trudeau picked up an endorsement from former president Barack Obama. Singh, meanwhile, landed an endorsement from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday. Subject: Native rights; Paris Agreement; Fossil fuels; Endorsements; Subsidies; Climate change; Environmental tax"

"2021-09-19","Full text: Federal Liberal Party of Canada candidate for Skeena-Bulkley Valley, Lakhwinder Jhaj, issued a challenge to Incumbent NDP candidate Taylor Bachrach over veterinary issues in northwest B.C. on a campaign stopover in Prince Rupert, Sept. 15. In an impromptu office visit to The Northern View, Jhaj spoke about issues at the centre of her platform such as veterinary access, housing and healthcare. She said issues are similar in all cities. Jhaj is visiting the Skeena-Bulkley Valley riding for the first time this week during the 2021 federal election campaign tour. With mounting stresses on pet-owners in the northwest and with more than 3,000 feral cats in the city, a pet owner herself, Jhaj asked what the NDP have done in their six consecutive terms in office to address the long-standing issue of veterinary care access in the riding. “If I were elected, this is something I would definitely look into,” Jhaj said. “I challenge the NDP candidate … what have they done? When you elect somebody, you would think that they would be looking after the needs of the community if they live in the community,” she said. “Don’t they know the needs? What have they done in the past to fix or even bring these issues to light to see if there is a fixable solution. So, that’s what I ask the person who the community elected. I put the question back to him.” Currently, Jhaj lives in the Lower Mainland but said, if elected, she would move to the northwestern riding of the province, making it her home. She said that the housing issue in Prince Rupert “is exactly the same as in other communities,” such as in the Lower Mainland, and that her party is working towards getting affordable housing in place, but that will come in time. “Prince Rupert has become a lively city now and, as people come in, they will start to build. Independent people will start to build. If they can afford to live in a community, building a house is not as challenging,” she said. Jhaj said she understands the struggle to get through red tape when building a home as she has been trying to get approval to build a house in Abbotsford for more than a year. “What I would suggest, perhaps people need to go into mobile homes… those do not have requirements of digging underneath [muskeg] and doing all that kind of extra work,” she said. “The mobile home you can plunk it on a lot of different types of areas … But with mobile homes perhaps in smaller communities like this, that may be the solution,” Jhaj said. The type of mobile home she suggested is a prefabricated home manufactured off-site into sections in advance and can be easily shipped and assembled. In terms of addressing healthcare and the shortage of doctors available in the North, Jhaj said the need could be filled with foreign workers. “I would personally work towards getting foreign students, that have done their degrees in other countries, to get them (medical) residencies in remote communities where they would sign a contract, at least, a four-year contract,” she said. She said the medical residents could work on a rotational four-year contract with other students to replace them, so there would be no doctor shortages. She said they would not be paid as much as doctors, but their services would be the same. The Northern View has reached out to the NDP candidate for comment.

"2021-09-19","Full text: Perry Simon was holding up an eagle feather gifted by his great aunt when he asked the five major federal party leaders about whether they intend to make First Nations, Metis and Inuit languages part of the official languages of the country. “It’s a question that should’ve been asked, addressed and resolved decades ago,” said the Kanehsata’kehró:non. “If leaders have a plan, it needs to include Indigenous languages in Canada and Quebec.” On Wednesday, September 8, during the federal election French-language leaders debate, Simon sought answers on the topic of respecting and honouring Onkwehón:we languages. The Kanesatake community member was met with a range of answers from the participating leaders present at the debate held in Gatineau. The leaders in question were incumbent prime minister and Liberal party leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative leader Erin O’Toole, New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh, Green Party leader Annamie Paul and Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet. As the Liberals and Conservatives bump heads in the electoral lead, Trudeau was quick to give his party credit for nominating Nunavik-native Inuk governor general, Mary May (Ningiukudluk) Simon, who speaks both English and Inuktitut. Although Trudeau said he would add Indigenous languages to Canada’s official list, O’Toole scrambled to answer the question – instead emphasizing the need for services to accommodate non-English or French speakers. Ultimately, O’Toole indicated French and English would remain the only two official languages. Meanwhile, Singh, Paul and Blanchet all agreed to make these languages official if elected into office. “It’s a small thing that we can do that’s going to have a big impact,” said Singh. Throughout the rest of the Indigenous rights portion of the debate, leaders answered a medley of questions tackling issues, including the drinking water crisis affecting Onkwehón:we communities, along with the topic of reconciliation. “I’m always looking to give our platform to Indigenous leadership to speak for themselves and I hope that one day, one of our parties will have a female leader from one of our First Nations because it’s time to have that leadership,” said the Green Party leader when answering Simon. The idea of submitting a question about Indigenous languages came to Simon as he listened to Canada’s newly sworn-in governor general delivering her first speech in July. “Even though I don’t understand Inuktitut, hearing her speak the language when she presented herself felt like music to my ear,” said Simon. “She addressed the country in the language her mother, grandparents and ancestors taught her – and that touched me like velvet to my heart.” When he heard news of the hundreds of complaints made against the appointment of the Inuk leader, Simon said each complaint felt like “a slap to the face.” “When I asked my question, I thought of all Indigenous Peoples – including Ms. Mary Simon,” said the Kanehsata’kehró:non. “The following day, when I saw the debate translated in Inuktitut, I hoped the governor general would hear my question. “I want her to know that I asked this question because I no longer want people to insult us for speaking our mother tongues,” continued Simon. After growing up in Kanesatake, Simon moved to Montreal at the age of 19 to pursue his studies. He subsequently stayed in the metropolis where he still resides today. Having spent the majority of his life in the city, Simon explained it wasn’t always in his nature to explicitly flaunt his Kanien’kehá:ka status. As years went by and that Onkwehón:we representation became more common in different spheres, Simon found himself more assertive of his identity. While he held up his feather and showcased his beaded necklace in front of millions of viewers, there’s one thing Simon still lusts after. “However proud I am to be Mohawk, it’s the language I’m still missing,” said the 63-year- old. “I hope I still have time in my life to learn it.” Not being a fluent Kanien’kéha speaker only further pushed Simon to ask leaders this burning question. “In the past, they wanted to erase who we were and this applied to our languages as well – they wanted them to disappear, so that they no longer had to be recognized,” he said. “But, like everything else, our languages cannot be killed. They cannot and we will not let them die.” Simon, who will soon be turning 64, said he hopes for one wish as elections near an end. “There’s a lot left to be done in order to recognize our rights and while I’m still alive, I want to see Indigenous languages recognized as official languages in Canada,” he said. “Recognition is what I’m looking for. The recognition that Indigenous people and languages are important in Canada and Quebec.” laurence.b.dubreuil@gmail.com Subject: Native languages; Leadership; Governor General-Canada; Governors; Native rights; Inuktitut language; Native North Americans; Language policy"

He has lived across the world and consulted for vaccine manufacturers in South Africa, China and India. In 2002, Laferrière moved back to Canada and began living again in Mississauga. The framers of constitutional democracies were thinking of someone just like Laferrière when they envisioned the types of leaders who would guide society, after long careers gaining experience that would one day benefit those who trust people like him to represent their best interests. “I read Barack Obama's autobiography in early spring, A Promised Land, and I was actually very inspired by what he had written,” he told The Pointer. “I had considered running for different parties at different times but I was so fed up with what I was seeing, I thought, ‘Well, I'm going to take a look at Greens and see what they're up to’. And when I found that they were actually looking for candidates, the opportunity presented itself.” Laferrière is on the ballot alongside Liberal incumbent Omar Alghabra and Conservative candidate Kathy-Ying Zhao. Teneshia Samuel is the NDP’s candidate, while Elie Diab is representing the People’s Party of Canada. While his expertise in the area of vaccine development sets him apart from other candidates, it is the climate crisis that motivated Laferrière to throw his hat into the ring. He says it is the top issue he hears when he goes door-knocking in Mississauga Centre. All of Canada’s major parties have put forward substantial climate plans ahead of the 2021 general election, arguably for the first time ever. But Laferrière believes the Green Party’s long-running history of leadership and advocacy on the climate sets it apart from the rest. “When I'm meeting with the electorate, when I'm going door to door, this is how I initiate the conversation with them and ask them: ‘Do you think enough is being done to prevent climate change, to moderate climate change?’” he said. “Almost unanimous, everyone says that climate change is the number one issue. I think the Green Party has good credentials when it comes to understanding all the different... targets, implementation and transitioning to a green economy.”"

"2021-09-19","Full text: Federal Liberal Party of Canada candidate for Skeena-Bulkley Valley, Lakhwinder Jhaj, issued a challenge to Incumbent NDP candidate Taylor Bachrach over veterinary issues in northwest B.C. on a campaign stopover in Prince Rupert, Sept. 15. In an impromptu office visit to The Northern View, Jhaj spoke about issues at the centre of her platform such as veterinary access, housing and healthcare. She said issues are similar in all cities. Jhaj is visiting the Skeena-Bulkley Valley riding for the first time this week during the 2021 federal election campaign tour. With mounting stresses on pet-owners in the northwest and with more than 3,000 feral cats in the city, a pet owner herself, Jhaj asked what the NDP have done in their six consecutive terms in office to address the long-standing issue of veterinary care access in the riding. “If I were elected, this is something I would definitely look into,” Jhaj said. “I challenge the NDP candidate … what have they done? When you elect somebody, you would think that they would be looking after the needs of the community if they live in the community,” she said. “Don’t they know the needs? What have they done in the past to fix or even bring these issues to light to see if there is a fixable solution. So, that’s what I ask the person who the community elected. I put the question back to him.” Currently, Jhaj lives in the Lower Mainland but said, if elected, she would move to the northwestern riding of the province, making it her home. She said that the housing issue in Prince Rupert “is exactly the same as in other communities,” such as in the Lower Mainland, and that her party is working towards getting affordable housing in place, but that will come in time. “Prince Rupert has become a lively city now and, as people come in, they will start to build. Independent people will start to build. If they can afford to live in a community, building a house is not as challenging,” she said. Jhaj said she understands the struggle to get through red tape when building a home as she has been trying to get approval to build a house in Abbotsford for more than a year. “What I would suggest, perhaps people need to go into mobile homes… those do not have requirements of digging underneath [muskeg] and doing all that kind of extra work,” she said. “The mobile home you can plunk it on a lot of different types of areas … But with mobile homes perhaps in smaller communities like this, that may be the solution,” Lakwinder said. The type of mobile home she suggested is a prefabricated home manufactured off-site into sections in advance and can be easily shipped and assembled. In terms of addressing healthcare and the shortage of doctors available in the North, Jhaj said the need could be filled with foreign workers. “I would personally work towards getting foreign students, that have done their degrees in other countries, to get them (medical) residencies in remote communities where they would sign a contract, at least, a four-year contract,” she said. She said the medical residents could work on a rotational four-year contract with other students to replace them, so there would be no doctor shortages. She said they would not be paid as much as doctors, but their services would be the same. The Northern View has reached out to the NDP candidate for comment.

"2021-09-19","Full text: Five Eyes ties still strong, Canada insists WASHINGTON - Nothing to see here, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted Thursday after the United States and two other major Canadian allies unveiled a new intelligence-sharing agreement in the Indo-Pacific region — one that's prompting questions about the future of the so-called Five Eyes alliance. The Five Eyes — Canada, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. — is the colloquial name of a long-standing multilateral arrangement for keeping security tabs on a part of the world where China's growing influence is being watched with apprehension around the globe. That's why the unexpected new bargain between the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, christened AUKUS, is raising eyebrows in foreign-policy circles internationally, as well as on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border. ""We continue to be strong members of the Five Eyes, and continue to share information and security approaches with our partners,"" Trudeau said during an election campaign stop in Montreal. He characterized the new agreement as being mainly about a decision by Australia, increasingly nervous about Chinese ambition in its backyard, to acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, scuttling long-standing negotiations to procure a submarine fleet from France. ""This is a deal for nuclear submarines, which Canada is not currently or any time soon in the market for; Australia is,"" Trudeau said. ""That is what we will continue to work alongside our partners to ensure — that we're keeping ourselves safe, that we're standing up against challenges, including those posed by China."" Those challenges have become substantial in recent years, compromising Canada's ability to frame its relationship with China as one rooted largely in mutually beneficial trade and economic growth, with a periodic shove on matters of human rights and national security. Former prime minister Stephen Harper struggled to walk that line in 2012 when he grudgingly approved a Chinese state-owned company's takeover of Calgary-based oilsands giant Nexen Inc., while simultaneously unveiling stringent new foreign-ownership rules. The Liberal government abandoned its pursuit of a trade deal with China, and has long hedged its bets on Huawei Inc., the Chinese tech monolith whose 5G network ambitions are seen by many around the world as a major national security threat. Of the Five Eyes partners, only Canada has stopped short of a ban. The 2018 arrest in Vancouver of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, wanted on a U.S. extradition warrant, thickened the plot considerably — especially when China detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in what was widely seen as an act of retribution. ""There's a line in the Rush song 'Free Will' that says, 'If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice,'"" said Eric Miller, a Canada-U.S. expert and president of the D.C.-based Rideau Potomac Strategy Group. ""That's been the problem: that Canada hasn't known what it wants out of the China relationship."""

"2021-09-18","Full text: (ANNews) – On September 15, 2021, following the announcement and celebration of a renewed Memorandum of Dialogue and Collaboration between the City of Edmonton and Confederacy of Treaty No. 6 First Nations, Mayor Don Iveson took time to make another announcement. Following weeks of public pressure, including advocacy from other members of City Council, the Mayor, in collaboration with City Manager Andre Corbould and Edmonton Police Chief Dale McFee, announced that the City would be recognizing September 30, 2021 as a new holiday. Seemingly altering the previous trajectory of not allowing staff time-off work to reflect on the history of Residential Schools. In an official release, City Manager Andre Corbould stated “Our commitment to the Indigenous community we share these lands with is to continue to work with, understand, and grow as we recognize past wrongs and build bridges to the future.” In the same release, Chief McFee added, “…the Edmonton Police Service is honoured to have this opportunity to reflect on our shared history and the impacts on Indigenous communities.” During his comments in City Hall, Mayor Iveson was clear to highlight the importance of the day and the role of reflection in Truth and Reconciliation. He furthered this reflection, “…this is the truth we all acknowledge, a truth that spurs us on to a renewed reckoning with our history, a deeper understanding of who we are meant to be as Treaty people…” Incumbent Councillor Aaron Paquette supports this positive change by stating, “This is a positive move and really reflects the stated priorities of Edmontonians – in fact they are asking; why isn’t the Province following the example of Alberta’s big cities.” Councillor Paquette was making reference to the fact that the City of Calgary announced, on September 8, 2021, that the day would be recognized as a holiday, with special events also being held. These realities, once again reflect the important role Municipal governments have played regarding leadership during this time of COVID-19. Taken as a whole, the entire process of people recognizing and reflecting on the Residential School system, its ramifications and being away from work may be a welcome reprieve as the 4th wave of COVID-19 ravages the province. Once again serving as an example of Indigenous perseverance and practice providing mainstream society the tools necessary to survive through dark times. Although a positive step forward, it is also important for Edmontonians to question why a simple action required so much pressure. There is no doubt that the current storm of election cycles has begun to drain people’s patience. Coupled with the rise and visibility of right wing beliefs, it becomes very risky for people to want to do the right thing. Especially when the right thing involves minorities and the re-examination of Canada’s shared history. Rob Houle is an LJI reporter for Alberta Native News.

"2021-09-18","Full text: RESPs an underutilized savings vehicle HALIFAX - When Jacob Ritchie and his wife Krista first had kids, setting money aside for their children’s post-secondary education seemed like a luxury they couldn’t afford. The engineer and professor were still early in their careers — and paying off their own student loans. “We were at the point where every dollar mattered,” he says. “We had to pay for daycare and other bills.” But when they bought a house and got to know a financial planner, the couple opened Registered Education Savings Plans, or RESPs, for their three children. “We developed a relationship with someone at the bank and trusted them,” Ritchie says. “But that only happened when we had means and money.” A new poll says that while most Canadians are aware of RESPs, less than half are currently using the investment vehicle. The survey by The Canada Life Assurance Co. also found that only 17 per cent of respondents said they were knowledgeable about the benefits and contribution limits of the savings tool. That’s despite education planning being cited as a top priority for Canadians with kids under 18 — second only to retirement. With the rising cost of post-secondary education, Paul Orlander with Canada Life said an RESP is an effective way to save for a child’s education while helping them avoid excessive student debt. “The government will match 20 per cent of your RESP contribution every year up to $500,” said Orlander, executive vice-president, individual customer, with Canada Life. Earnings on contributions grow tax-free while in the RESP. “That's sort of free money and that doesn't appear too often overall in our lives.” The survey found the average total contribution to an RESP is about $22,800, with a median monthly contribution of $210. Yet some parents may not be contributing to an RESP because they simply can’t afford it, a recent Statistics Canada study suggested. It found that RESP participation rates tend to rise substantially with family income. The research indicated that differences in wealth remain the single most important factor behind the gap in RESP participation by family income — even after accounting for differences in parental education and literacy, numeracy and financial literacy. “People are worried about paying for housing and child care and putting food on the table now,” said Erika Shaker, director of the national office of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. “They may not have extra money to set aside for something that’s 10 or 15 years down the road.” The big issue is the soaring cost of post-secondary education and the complex web of student financial aid in each province that shifts with nearly each election cycle, she said. A Statistics Canada report released last week said Canadian students enrolled full-time in undergraduate programs will pay an average of $6,693 in tuition for the upcoming 2021-2022 academic year, up 1.7 per cent from the previous year. Knowledge First Financial, which specializes in education savings, said that by 2030, the average cost of a four-year post-secondary degree will be about $111,698 with residence and $55,548 without residence. “Telling people to save more and dangling a (government contribution) as if the problem is a lack of motivation rather than a simple lack of funds will not address the underlying problem, which is cost,” Shaker said. Dalhousie University economics professor Lars Osberg said the problem is the privatization of the financial burden of university education. He said some graduates delay buying a home, starting a family, or even contributing to a savings vehicle like an RESP for their child because of high student loan debt. “We’ve shifted away from a social responsibility for post-secondary education to a privatized responsibility,” Osberg said. “It downloads a lot of pressure onto individual parents and students.” In addition to parents struggling to pay off their own student loans, he says middle-class incomes have largely stagnated over the last few decades leaving little money to put into savings. Still, Orlander with Canada Life said opening an RESP early is valuable, even if parents can’t afford to save much. “Establishing the savings habit toward the goal is half the battle,” he said. “Setting up a routine contribution is a critical first step, because it allows you to consider increasing it down the road.” Orlander added: “The ability of even smaller amounts to build over time through compounding makes a tremendous impact at the end of the day. Every little bit helps.”"

"2021-09-18","Full text: N.S. books $341.6-million deficit for 2020-21 HALIFAX - Nova Scotia's deficit for the 2020-21 fiscal year is $341.6 million — a figure the province's finance minister says won't affect the new Tory government's election promise to spend significantly on health care. Allan MacMaster closed the books for the previous fiscal year on Thursday, telling reporters that COVID-19 was the main reason for a $396.6-million drop from the $55-million surplus forecast in the budget tabled by the previous Liberal government in February 2020, just before the pandemic hit. MacMaster said while there were extra expenditures because of the pandemic, the response by Nova Scotians in adhering to COVID-19 protocols and keeping virus numbers down actually helped lessen the overall impact to the economy. ""We could have had more extended lockdowns, which could have impacted our economy more greatly,"" he said. ""Nova Scotians took care of themselves, and as a result the economy restarted more quickly than in some other jurisdictions."" MacMaster said the province responded with close to $940 million in pandemic-related operating and capital spending during the fiscal year that ended March 31, helped by $462.2 million in federal aid. Total expenses increased by nearly $219 million to $12.63 billion because of increased support for health-care services during the pandemic and to support various sectors of the economy. As well, total revenues were down by $178 million because of lower tax revenue and federal transfer payments. The Progressive Conservatives, who were elected to a majority government Aug. 17, campaigned almost solely on fixing the province's ailing health-care system. The party pledged $430 million in spending for the sector during their first year in power for areas including a pension plan for doctors, the extension of operating room hours on weekdays and 2,500 more long-term care beds. MacMaster said that plan won't change, based on what he's seen to date. ""We did say that we would deficit spend if necessary to fix health care, and we intend to do that,"" he said. The minister said the government would also spend more if necessary to meet needs that arise as a result of the ongoing pandemic, despite a net debt that has grown to $16.4 billion from $15.2 billion since the end of March, 2020. MacMaster said the rising debt won't effect the government's ability to operate as long as it sticks to the fiscal plan in its platform. He is expected to present an update on the current fiscal year by the end of this month. Former Liberal finance minister Labi Kousoulis tabled the 2021-22 budget in late March. It projected a $585-million deficit caused by pandemic costs, including an estimated $350 million for such things as personal protective equipment and vaccination clinics around the province.

Bernier stepped out of the Cosmic Cruiser, a unique limosine, to an adoring crowd dressed in purple and white, as the Twisted Sister anthem “We’re Not Gonna Take It” blasted from the speakers. Between 300 to 400 people turned out at the Freedom Rally, held in support of Chatham-Kent–Leamington candidate Liz Vallee. Bernier told the cheering crowd the PPC is going to “unite Canadians under the umbrella of freedom. He denounced the Trudeau government’s support of mandatory vaccines and vaccine passports. Bernier’s oft repeated credo of “when tyranny becomes law, revolution becomes our duty,” was well received, even though the phrase resembles messages put forward by far right groups in the United States. Bernier said the PPC would cut funding to provinces for the implementation of the vaccine passport, as well as cutting funding to the CBC and mainstream media. The announcement was greeted with wild applause. Bernier went on to say that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Erin O’Toole are the same and neither will do anything to cut the deficit or curb inflation. Bernier worked the crowd, posed for dozens of selfies and hugged supporters before and after his speech. Prior to his speech, Bernier had a sit down meeting with a few small business owners inside the restaurant. Vallee spoke to the gathering as well, leading the crowd in a rousing freedom chant, saying there’s no place for the “tyranny” of the vaccine passport. “There’s no room in Canada for segregation,” Vallee told her supporters. “I am so disgusted by our government. “This election is a referendum on the vaccine passport,” she added. Social distancing and masking were non-existent throughout the rally’s carnival-like atmosphere, which saw many of the heavy hitters of the anti-vax, anti-mask so-called “freedom” movement take to the stage to deliver messages. Independent MPP Randy Hillier, firebrand preacher Henry Hildebrandt and Chris VandenBos of Police on Guard for Thee were among the speakers. The PPC’s traditional purple and white shirts were augmented by other messages. One man sported an InfoWars shirt, another’s said ‘Fire Arm Hits are Human Rights Hits, and yet another decried Bill Gates and Anthony Faucci as violators of the Nuremberg Code. Ridgetown resident Apolonia Henderson, who was on the sidewalk waving a PPC flag, said it was her duty to show her support. “It’s the only party that has expressed any concern about our freedoms,” Henderson said.

"2021-09-18","Full text: Long-term water advisory lifted for First Nation SHOAL LAKE, ONTARIO, CANADA - Angelina McLeod spent most of her life in Shoal Lake 40 First Nation watching her uncles and her father, Alfred Redsky, a former chief, fight for clean drinking water and a better way of life. The moment came Wednesday when, for the first time in nearly 25 years, the water flowing through the community's taps was deemed safe to drink. ""It was like I was there seeing it for them,"" McLeod said in a phone interview. McLeod's father died in 2013. She kept up his fight as a documentarian and eventual councillor for the Anishinaabe community on the Manitoba-Ontario boundary. On Wednesday, the First Nation celebrated the opening of its long-anticipated water treatment plant with a special event, which included a tour of the facility. A long-term boil-water advisory for the community, which was issued in 1998 and was one of the longest in Canada, was also lifted. ""It's the end of years of struggles trying to get the basic necessities of life, clean drinking water,"" said McLeod. Shoal Lake 40 was cut off from the outside world more than a century ago during the construction of an aqueduct that supplies Winnipeg with its drinking water. The community's land became a man-made island, only accessible by a ferry in the summer and a dangerous ice road in the winter. McLeod's mother died when a canoe she was in capsized as she was trying to get back home on the island. McLeod, 43, said her family's home didn't have running water and many households had to rely on bottled water. It wasn't until she left the community that she realized it wasn't normal. She said being isolated on the island without clean drinking water took a toll on her mental health. ""When I started learning about the outside world, when I was growing up, I started feeling less than who I was,"" McLeod recalled. She said some members also began to experience health problems due to what they believe was the water. The community advocated for years for an all-season transportation link and, in 2019, what became known as ""Freedom Road"" was completed. Construction on the water treatment plant began soon after. Federal Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller was in the community Wednesday for the celebration. ""The people of Shoal Lake 40 have fought hard for this day,"" Miller said on Twitter. Miller and Chief Vernon Redsky were the first to test the water when they toasted at the opening, McLeod added. ""They said it tasted good,"" she said with a laugh. Federal Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau spoke on the election campaign trail Tuesday about the advisory being lifted. He said his government is still committed to ending long-term boil water advisories, a promise the Liberals first made during the 2015 election campaign. ""Indigenous people who have lived on that land for generations and millennia can't drink the water. We're fixing that,"" Trudeau said. Numbers from Indigenous Services Canada from Aug. 28 show there were 51 long-term drinking water advisories in 32 communities. Some 109 advisories had been lifted since November 2015. The community also celebrated the opening of the brand new Harvey Redsky Memorial School, a kindergarten to Grade 8 school, named after a beloved band member and former custodian in the community. McLeod spearheaded the project. She said she also has her sights set on building its first high school, and with the new water treatment plant finally in place, she believes it's just the beginning.

"2021-09-17","Full text: Canada and the United States have struck an agreement to allow U.S.-assisted Afghan evacuees currently living in a third country to enter Canada if they meet certain asylum requirements, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has announced. Canada will welcome up to 5,000 refugees whose evacuations were facilitated by the U.S. The agreement is part of Canada’s commitment to welcome 20,000 Afghan refugees in the wake of the Taliban’s takeover of that country. According to IRCC’s announcement, this collaboration will help reduce current pressures in the global resettlement system, facilitating and accelerating wider international efforts to support Afghan refugees and to welcome them to Canada. Refugees must meet all eligibility and admissibility requirements, including entering Canada from countries where they have been temporarily located after fleeing Afghanistan. The agreement comes amidst growing demands to make the plight of Afghan citizens an issue in the federal election campaign following the end of Canada’s evacuation mission. Many have criticized the federal government for its evacuation operation in Afghanistan starting too late, leaving many vulnerable Afghans behind. The announcement is welcome news to Farzana, who’s asked to be only identified by her first name because she fears she could be in danger. She is a 21-year-old Afghan national who flew out of Afghanistan on U.S. flights. “My mother worked for a military family in Afghanistan. She asked them to take me out of Afghanistan with them. I flew to Qatar and then to Germany,” she told New Canadian Media. Farzana, who was studying Pharmacology in Afghanistan when the Taliban took over, explained her situation to the IRCC via email, hoping to receive refuge in Canada. She has not heard from the government as of the time of writing. Although Canada has announced this agreement which could potentially help people like Farzana, she has no hope of receiving a response because of what she describes as a deluge of emails from Afghan nationals in similar situations to IRCC. Farzana told NCM that upon arriving in Germany, the people who had helped her get out of Afghanistan could no longer accompany her. As of time of writing, Farzana is on her own in Germany, waiting for a visa from the U.S. or Canada. “I want to be reunited with my parents and two younger sisters. I don’t want my mother to work in people’s houses anymore,” she said. Canada and the U.S. have a long record of cooperation in border and immigration affairs. The Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), for example, requires refugee claimants to seek refugee protection in the first safe country they arrive in unless they qualify for an exception. According to the federal government, the Agreement helps both countries better manage access to the refugee system in each country for people crossing the Canada–U.S. land border. But many migrant rights advocates have come out against it, arguing it gives Canadian and American governments too much control over the outcome of refugee applications, thus increasing the rate of denials and deportations. Generally, not all asylum seekers succeed in obtaining refugee status in the first country they enter — for various reasons including errors or unfairness that occur in a country’s assessment of the asylum claimant. As a result, they would pass through a few countries and make a claim in each of them. The Canadian and American governments have argued that is not an efficient way to receive and evaluate claims since both countries have very similar legal systems. The STCA therefore limits asylum seekers to making one claim in the first safe country in which they arrive. As a result, most people who come to Canada via the U.S. are prevented from claiming asylum in this country. There are some exceptions to this which includes unaccompanied minors, having family members like a spouse or parent who’s already a citizen or permanent resident, having a valid work or study permit, and public interest reasons such as facing the possibility of a death sentence in the U.S. “The court decided that the STCA would cease to have effect in January 2021. However, this deadline was extended by the Federal Court of Appeal, pending an appeal by the federal government.” The Agreement between Canada and the U.S. for the Sharing of Visa and Immigration Information also lays out mutual obligations for the sharing of relevant biographic and biometric-based information through automated processes to assist in the effective administration and enforcement of each country’s respective immigration laws. Although Canada has promised to resettle some 20,000 Afghan refugees, it has transported or facilitated the transport of 3,700 so far, including Canadian citizens, their family members, citizens of allied countries, people with a lasting connection to Canada, and Afghan nationals at risk accepted for resettlement in Canada or by its allies.

"2021-09-17","Full text: (ANNews) – Edmonton-Griesbach federal NDP candidate Blake Desjarlais says his Metis heritage and understanding of systemic racism had a major impact on his political journey. “Canadians take for granted the tremendous wealth, privileges and rights that we have in Canada, but the reality is not everyone enjoys them,” Desjarlais told the Alberta Native News. “That’s what began my journey in politics — understanding why some people had them and some people didn’t, why the towns and cities had cleaning drinking water, and the reserves and Metis Settlements didn’t, (and) why the unemployment rate was so disproportionately high in Indigenous communities. “These are things you can’t ignore.” Desjarlais was born and raised on the Fishing Lake Metis Settlement, which is 300 km northeast of Edmonton, bordering Frog Lake First Nation. His father, who died when Desjarlais was 12, was a carpenter who built homes across the province. He came to Edmonton when he was 17 to study at MacEwan University. “It was just one hell of a time there. I left largely due to racism against Indigenous people,” said Desjarlais, who wanted to study architecture, influenced by his father, as well as famed Indigenous architect Douglas Cardinal, who designed the Canadian Museum of History in Ottawa. While post-secondaries talk a big game when it comes to recruiting Indigenous students and helping them advance their careers, they don’t have the support systems in place for many of them to succeed, he says. Once he reflected on the history of Confederation and how an overseas empire imposed its will on Indigenous peoples through the Indian Act, he understood that his experiences were the result of deeply-embedded racism throughout Canadian institutions. Desjarlais says that he’s running for the NDP because of his frustrations working with the federal Liberal government over the past six years in his role as the national director for the Metis Settlements General Council. “It’s difficult right now,” he said. “I’ve heard from so many Indigenous leaders across the country, who are stuck in this position where they feel as if they must get these alliances (with) the Liberal government in order to advance issues related to their communities.” This reality was recently displayed when NDP leader Jagmeet Singh hosted an event with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Arlen Dumas and Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) Grand Chief Garrison Settee in Churchill, Man., who endorsed the Liberal candidate running against NDP MP Niki Ashton. “Working with the Liberals, it’s just so slow. There’s a lot of talk but there’s very little action,” says Desjarlais. “The reality is Indigenous people can’t wait. We’ve been waiting 150 years for our constitutional rights to be respected.” Desjarlais is running against Conservative incumbent Kerry Diotte in the September 20 election, who was re-elected in 2019 with 51 per cent of the vote. NDP MLA Janis Irwin ran federally against Diotte in 2015, losing by just under 3,000 votes, or six percentage points. While many see the Alberta NDP and federal NDP at odds over the former’s support for the oil and gas industry, Desjarlais says he’s gotten a lot of support from the provincial party, particularly from Irwin and the other two MLAs whose ridings overlap with Griesbach — David Eggen and Chris Nielsen. Desjarlais calls himself the “exact opposite of who Kerry Diotte is and what he represents,” blasting Diotte for voting against banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ people as a major example. With almost 10% of Edmonton-Griesbach’s population being Indigenous, he says they can play a major role in flipping the riding from blue to orange. Desjarlais says electing more Indigenous people to office will have a positive impact, regardless of which party they represent. “That’s what’s at stake here — making sure Indigenous perspectives are uplifted and we share our learning with the world. We have so much to teach and so much to say as Indigenous people through our experience that has been largely rejected, hidden and ignored,” says Desjarlais. “This is the time right now — 2021 — where we’re going to turn a new leaf. Let’s show the world what Indigenous people can do.” Subject: Native peoples; Racism; Metis"

"2021-09-17","Full text: Indigenous tourism faces tough pandemic recovery VANCOUVER - The Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada is making a bleak prediction about its members' ability to rapidly recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The association says even with the very best travel conditions, Indigenous tourism operations are not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2028. A report from the association and the Conference Board of Canada shows modest recovery over the last year, but it still projects an overall 54 per cent decline since the pandemic hit last March. It says Indigenous tourism created about 39,000 jobs and contributed an estimated $1.86 billion in direct gross domestic product before the arrival of COVID-19. That fell to just $580 million and about 11,000 workers at the height of virus-induced shutdowns and recovered this year to just under 19,000 employees and $858 million in direct GDP. The report says the pandemic has had a ""deep and serious impact"" on most Indigenous tourism operators and the conference board estimates at least one-third of the businesses that took part in its recent surveys could still be at risk of closure by 2022. More than 60 per cent of the roughly 650 Indigenous tourism operators that participated in the 2020 and 2021 surveys reported concerns that COVID-19 would affect their business into next year or longer. Keith Henry, president and CEO of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada, said the findings are important even though the devastating effects of the pandemic were expected. ""Research like this is important to gauge the health of our industry with concrete data, even if it shows our greatest fears playing out, including over one billion dollars worth of sales lost,"" Henry said in the release issued by the association and conference board. The association's research used the Destination Canada recovery model and found a return to pre-pandemic 2019 levels would take even longer, almost a decade, to 2028. ""An even bigger decline is expected if more waves of COVID-19 force further provincial and territorial lockdowns and issues around human resources and lack of support continue to strike across the country,"" said the release. Indigenous-led solutions and tailored policy responses from government are the best way to meet the diverse needs of Indigenous tourism businesses, Henry said. He called for the issue to become a key topic addressed by all parties in the final week of the federal election campaign. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 15, 2021.

"2021-09-17","Full text: Party leaders talk affordability in push for votes OTTAWA - The question of who would make life more affordable for Canadians hit the campaign trail Wednesday with party leaders defending why their spending plans would ease pressures as inflation hit a near two-decade high. On Wednesday morning, Statistics Canada reported prices increased by 4.1 per cent in August compared with the same month one year earlier, fuelled by rising consumer demand and supply-chain constraints for many goods. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole were quick to pin blame for rising prices on what they called Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's inaction on multiple fronts, including in the country's hot housing sector. The spending plans from each party could put more pressure on prices and interest rates, and they could hurt, rather than help, voters' pocketbooks, according to a Scotiabank analysis of platform commitments. The federal government has pumped billions of dollars in aid to hard-hit families, putting a financial floor under them while also spurring demand for goods and services. But the supply of those goods and services has yet to catch up. None of the parties are promising to turn off the taps in the near term even as the economy recovers. Measures aimed at adding stimulus into household budgets would, if enacted, stimulate more spending, add to demand and further push up prices, Rebekah Young, Scotiabank's director of fiscal and provincial economics, said Wednesday. ""Platforms are going to boost spending a bit more over the next year or so, precisely at a time where we're already seeing inflation running hot,"" she said in an interview. ""We're all calling for (inflation) to be transitory and come back down over the next two years. Certainly, the platforms don't make that easy."" During a morning stop in Essex, Ont., Singh said that bringing down housing prices is one way to address affordability concerns, arguing wages haven't kept pace with the cost of ownership. But he stood firm on his party's spending plans that call for $214 billion in new social programs like pharmacare and dental care to help people hurt by the pandemic-induced downturn. ""A working-class person, middle-class person, when you go through an economic crisis, and there aren't supports in place, things get even worse,"" Singh said. ""If we don't invest in people, if we don't spend on our health care, don't make life more affordable, then they're the ones that are going to end up paying the price."" The national average home price is expected to reach $680,000 this year, up 20 per cent per cent from last year, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. Speaking in Halifax, Trudeau said his platform zeros in on affordability with hefty housing and child-care measures. He argued that O'Toole's housing plan, which incentivizes investors to inject money into rental housing by tweaking rules around capital gains taxes, wouldn't ease costs. And the Conservative child-care plan, Trudeau said, ""is a tax break that doesn't create any spaces"" or address affordability concerns. O'Toole pointed to his party's pledges to create more competition in the telecommunications market and tackle price fixing at grocery chains as measures to cool price pressures. The Conservative platform logs new spending at $52.5 billion over the next five years versus $78 billion under the Liberal platform over the same period. O'Toole argued his spending wouldn't add to price pressures by pointing to his promise to balance the books in the next decade. ""We have a plan to get Mr. Trudeau's spending under control. He never wants to get it under control,"" O'Toole said. Speaking in Quebec's Saguenay region, O'Toole also suggested he wouldn't open up competition in the country's supply-managed dairy sector, calling the policy ""pro-farming family"" and ""pro-food security."" The arguments formed the backdrop to parties' push to secure the last bit of support needed before Monday's vote, hoping to encourage their backers to the polls and lure voters who are undecided or could switch support. A recent poll conducted by Leger in collaboration with The Canadian Press indicated the Liberals and Tories were tied with the support of 32 per cent of decided voters ahead of the Sept. 20 election, with the NDP at 20 per cent. Trudeau argued anew to progressive voters that they could only entrust his party to stop the election of a Conservative government. Singh countered that Trudeau styles himself a progressive but has failed follow through, using the example of an unfulfilled pledge to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. O'Toole said his party had let voters down in the past, but he asked centrists to reconsider voting Conservative by arguing his party was more progressive than before.

"2021-09-17","Full text: The Union of BC Municipalities membership will debate 170 resolutions at their convention Sept. 15 and 16. The resolutions are classified into 14 categories including legislative, community safety, elections, transportation, taxation, finance, environment, land use, health and social development and housing. Special resolutions by the UBCM executive recommended for the membership to endorse include calling on the province to develop a replacement for the cancelled Climate Action Revenue Incentive Program (CARIP), which began in 2008. The special resolution consolidates five resolutions submitted by the membership this year on the issue, including one from the Regional District of Nanaimo. The executive’s resolution calls for a replacement program to include annualized funding that is equal to or greater than CARIP, formula-based funding that recognizes varying local capacity for climate action and maximum flexibility on eligible projects that support local needs and priorities. The executive will also put forward a special resolution on forest management; specifically requesting the province engage and consult with local governments and Indigenous communities while it implements recommendations of its Modernizing Forest Policy in BC intentions paper released in June, including matters related to old growth designations and deferrals. The resolution consolidates seven separate resolutions related to forests submitted by members. “The special resolution put forward by the executive reflects the need for continued local government consultation as the province moves forward to implement forest policy change that will impact B.C. communities,” the resolutions package says. An Islands Trust resolution on electronic permit and public hearing notification, is recommended for endorsement. It asks for an update to the Local Government Act “to allow temporary use permit and public hearing notifications to be provided electronically, via an application or website if the local government can demonstrate equal or greater ability to reach relevant constituents than a regular printed local newspaper.” The Regional District of Nanaimo submitted three resolutions in addition to one related to CARIP; all are recommended for endorsement. The first highlights the continued challenge of illegal dumping on Crown land and provincial rights-of-way and calls for further action from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy and improved partnerships with local governments. The second resolution calls for an amendment to the Local Government Act to give regional districts the same authority as municipalities to enact tree protection bylaws. The third resolution from the RDN requests a review of the 60-40 hospital district-provincial government cost-sharing model for hospital capital projects and consultation with regional hospital district boards to reduce the reliance on property tax funding at the local government level.

The Financial Accountability Office says no spending occurred from the fund in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and that health spending was 691-million dollars lower than planned in the area of population and public health. N-D-P leader Andrea Horwath says it's disgraceful that Premier Doug Ford is refusing to invest the dollars needed to help tackle the pandemic.

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 15 ... What we are watching in Canada ... The three main party leaders are in Eastern and Central Canada today, a day after a new poll suggested the already close race is getting even tighter. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau kicks things off with a morning announcement in Halifax. Erin O'Toole of the Conservatives is spending his day in Quebec, starting with a morning announcement in Jonquière, followed by an evening supporter event in Orford. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is in Ontario, first with a morning announcement in Essex on long-term care, then visiting with supporters in a number of communities before taking part in a Twitch stream event in the evening. Yesterday, a poll conducted by Leger in collaboration with The Canadian Press indicated the Liberals and Tories are tied with the support of 32 per cent of decided voters ahead of the election on Monday. A similar poll conducted two weeks ago had the Conservatives ahead with 34 per cent compared with 30 per cent for the Liberals.

Statistics Canada will say this morning what reading the consumer price index registered for August. The country's headline inflation barometer clocked in at 3.7 per cent in July, which was the highest year-over-year increase since May 2011 as price growth accelerated from June. Part of the elevated inflation reading for July was because prices are being compared to the lows seen one year ago during the early months of the pandemic, particularly gasoline and food. BMO's Benjamin Reitzes says although August is seasonally a weak month for the consumer price index, that may not hold true this year as he expects an annual inflation rate of 4.1 per cent in the month. In a note, he says rising restaurant prices may push up food prices that tend to dip in August and early fall. He also says the annual inflation rate could be pushed up in August by hot housing prices. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... WASHINGTON — Fearful of Donald Trump’s actions in his final weeks as president, the United States’ top military officer twice called his Chinese counterpart to assure him that the two nations would not suddenly go to war. A senior defence official acknowledged the conversations after they were described in excerpts from the forthcoming book “Peril” by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. The book says Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told Gen. Li Zuocheng of the People’s Liberation Army that he would warn his counterpart in the event of a U.S. attack. Trump said Milley should be tried for treason if the report was true. According to the defence official, Milley’s message to Li on both occasions was one of reassurance. The official questioned suggestions that Milley told Li he would call him first, and instead said the chairman made the point that the United States was not going to suddenly attack China without any warning — whether it be through diplomatic, administrative or military channels. Milley also spoke with a number of other chiefs of defence around the world in the days after the Jan. 6 riot, including military leaders from the United Kingdom, Russia and Pakistan. A readout of those calls in January referred to “several” other counterparts that he spoke to with similar messages of reassurance that the U.S. government was strong and in control. Trump responded with a sharply worded statement insisting he never considered attacking China. Still, he said that if the report was true, “I assume he would be tried for TREASON in that he would have been dealing with his Chinese counterpart behind the President’s back and telling China that he would be giving them notification ‘of an attack.’ Can’t do that!” --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... LONDON — The U.K. plans to offer a third dose of coronavirus vaccines to everyone over 50 and other vulnerable people to help the country ride out the pandemic through the winter months. The booster shots will be rolled out beginning next week. They were approved a day after the government backed plans to offer one dose of vaccine to children from 12 to 15 years old. Booster shots are aimed at protecting against a modest waning in immunity among those who have received two jabs. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday “the result of this vaccination campaign is we have one of the most free societies and one of the most open economies in Europe.” The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, which advises the government, recommended that booster shots be offered to everyone over 50, health care workers, people with underlying health conditions and those who live with people whose immune systems are compromised. They will be given no earlier than six months after a person received their second dose of vaccine. Around 30 million people will be eligible for the booster shots, which aim to protect against a modest waning in immunity among those who have received two jabs. Although the number of people now contracting COVID-19 is way higher than this time last year — over 30,000 new infections a day — the British government has opted not to re-introduce further virus restrictions for England, as the vaccine drive this year has reduced the number of people requiring treatment for COVID-19 and subsequently dying. --- On this day in 1773 ...

TORONTO — Neil Macdonald says his brother Norm lived by the maxim that comedy should always surprise and never pander, preferring that a joke be met with boos than to stoop for the cheap laugh. Macdonald died in Los Angeles from leukemia Tuesday, Neil said. While his diagnosis was never made public, Macdonald had been dealing with cancer for ""a long time,"" and his condition took a turn for the worst last month, he said. Macdonald was devoted to the craft of comedy, Neil said, and never aspired to make the transition from the stage to the big screen. ""If you speak to his friends like Adam Sandler, David Spade or Tim Meadows — the people he came up with at 'SNL' — they would all agree that Norm was the purest amongst them,"" Neil said by phone from Los Angeles. ""He was the comic's comic.""

News of Macdonald's death sparked an outpouring of grief on social media, with Steve Martin, David Letterman, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Jon Stewart and Bob Saget among the comedy heavyweights paying tribute. ""In every important way, in the world of standup, Norm was the best. An opinion shared by me and all peers. Always up to something, never certain, until his matter-of-fact delivery levelled you,"" tweeted Letterman. ""I was always delighted by his bizarre mind and earnest gaze.

O'FALLON, Mo. — A Missouri cave containing Native American artwork from more than 1,000 years ago has been sold at auction, a sale that disappointed leaders of the Osage Nation who had hoped to buy the land to protect and preserve a site that's sacred to them. A bidder agreed to pay $2.2 million to private owners for what’s known as “Picture Cave,” along with the 17 hilly hectares that surround it near the eastern Missouri town of Warrenton. The winning bidder was not named. The cave was the site of sacred rituals and burying of the dead. It also has more than 290 prehistoric hieroglyphic symbols used to represent sounds or meanings. A St. Louis family that's owned the land since 1953 has mainly used it for hunting. Researcher Carol Diaz-Granados opposed the sale. She and her husband, James Duncan, spent 20 years researching the cave and wrote a book about it. Duncan is a scholar in Osage oral history, and Diaz-Granados is a research associate in the anthropology department at Washington University in St. Louis. “Auctioning off a sacred American Indian site truly sends the wrong message,” Diaz-Granados said. “It’s like auctioning off the Sistine Chapel."" The Osage Nation, in a statement, called the sale “truly heartbreaking.” “Our ancestors lived in this area for 1300 years,” the statement read. “This was our land. We have hundreds of thousands of our ancestors buried throughout Missouri and Illinois, including Picture Cave.” The cave features drawings of people, animals, birds and mythical creatures. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 15, 2021 Subject: COVID-19 vaccines; Pandemics; Housing prices; Noncitizens; Political campaigns; Comedies; Consumer Price Index; Coronaviruses; Treason"

"2021-12-16","Full text: In the B’nai Brith Canada Election debate in the hotly-contested riding of Winnipeg South Centre, Liberal nominee Jim Carr said it was the responsibility of the Jewish community to welcome all experiencing persecution into Canada, such as the recently arrived refugees from Afghanistan. Carr shared the lasting impact of his own experiences of anti-Semitism in Canada but did not present a concrete plan to address anti-Semitism. There has been an 18.3 per cent rise in anti-Semitism in Canada in the past year, said debate moderator Howard Morry, and an exponential rise in attacks against Jews after the violence between Israel and Hamas in May 2021. Citing another incident of anti-Semitism that had occurred this same afternoon in Toronto, Carr said that according to B’nai Brith, these incidents are “out of control” and “anti-Semitism is the most virulent forum of hate crimes in Canada.” However, his subsequent comments not to divide around partisanship were directed towards Conservative nominee Joyce Bateman rather than alleviating the safety concerns of Jewish constituents. According to Bateman, the increase in anti-Semitism is “dressed up as anti-Zionism” and has been particularly prevalent in protests on Canadian university campuses. Bateman said the Conservatives plan to combat online hate speech through the Criminal Code and double the budget for the security infrastructure program launched by the previous Conservative government. NDP nominee Julia Riddell said that the NDP planned to convene a national working group to combat online hate as part of their National Plan to address anti-Semitism, as well as work on ensuring regulations to enforce the accountability of social media platforms. In Riddell’s view, the role of education is crucial to educate youth about different cultural groups and prevent stereotyping. While Bateman expressed the Conservatives’ support for the definition of anti-Semitism put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), Riddell said that the NDP was concerned it could undermine those speaking out for the rights of Palestinians. “Liberation for some is liberation for none,” she said. Bateman said the Conservatives had “grave concern” about the repeated violations of neutrality of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) towards Israel, which she described as “the only democracy in the middle east” and an ally to Canada. She said the Conservatives were committed to working toward reforming the UN Human Rights Council so “gross human rights abusers” cannot become members. According to Bateman, under the previous Conservative government, Canada had stopped funding UNGA, but as soon as they came to power, the Liberals reinstated this funding. She called out the party for its incongruency in embracing IHRA’s definition of anti-Semitism and then welcoming MP Jenica Atwin, who has called Israel “an apartheid state.” In addition, she said the Trudeau government voting twice against Israel at the UN “aligned Canada with despots, and dictators in callous self-interest.” According to Carr, however, UN funding was withheld until the investigation by Canadian officials was completed and the corrective action recommended by the Minister of International Development Karina Gould was taken. “Canada, of course, doesn’t want to have any association with any relief agency that promotes hatred, racism, or anti-Semitism,” he said, “and there can be no exceptions.” Riddell, whose grandparents were survivors of the Nazi occupation of Poland, said healing from these experiences requires their accurate representation in all forms of media, including textbooks. Research by Riddell and others has shown the significant ways that inaccurate information in textbooks contributes to prejudice and discrimination. Bateman and Carr were united in their unequivocal designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity. Although the NDP “strongly condemns” the provision of assistance for terrorist activities by Iran, Riddell deferred to the authority of the Minister of Public Safety to determine what entity qualifies as a terrorist organization based on comprehensive criminal and security intelligence reports. In Bateman’s view, Trudeau failed to hold the Iranian regime accountable for the shooting down of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which killed 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents. She said the Conservatives would impose Magnitsky sanctions on gross human rights violators, and fulfill the motion adopted by Parliament to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist entity. At the close of a debate marked by disparaging remarks between the Liberal and Conservative nominees, Riddell said the NDP is proposing a shift in the culture of politics so parties can work together. In her view, “the issues are bigger than any one party.” Subject: Conservatism; Nominations; Hate speech; Funding; Human rights; Debates; Anti-Semitism; Jewish people"

"2021-09-17","Full text: Melissa Ridgen made history last Thursday becoming the first Indigenous journalist representing an Indigenous national TV broadcaster to ask questions of the federal leaders during a nationally televised election debate. The APTN National News anchor, having been in the profession for 24 years, said she had no expectation that her questions would be answered fully by leaders Justin Trudeau (Liberal), Erin O’Toole (Conservative), Jagmeet Singh (New Democrat), Annamie Paul (Green) or Yves-François Blanchet (Bloc Quebecois). She was right not to expect too much. “To me, going in, it wasn’t necessarily about getting answers. It was posing questions so that the people watching could hear the issue. They’re not going to get answers, but plant the seed with the questions,” said Ridgen. The Indigenous section of the debate, one of five blocks, was kicked off virtually by 18-year-old Ojibway man Marek McLeod who asked the leaders how they would build trust with Indigenous peoples after 150 years of failure. “I felt nervous at that point,” said Ridgen. “You want to do people like Marek proud in asking those questions.” She said she “struggled” with how to balance the details of her questions, so she wouldn’t be “watering it down for a broader non-Indigenous audience.” “If it was me asking the leaders these questions on APTN for our audience, I might have asked them differently because our audience is coming in with a foundation of knowledge that the average Canadian doesn’t have…. I have to ask these questions so not just Indigenous people know what I’m asking and hear the answers, but to set the stage and plant the seeds for non-Indigenous people to know where we’re coming from,” said Ridgen. Ridgen developed the questions herself, but her “bosses” and colleagues gave feedback, which allowed her to “massage the wording.” The section of the debate that Ridgen addressed was on “reconciliation.” “I think it’s sad that the only reason it was mentioned and it’s an issue for Canadians now is because they’re upset with their own history which was all brought to light with the graves this summer. That’s not new. I think that was a frustration for a lot of us,” said Ridgen. In May, Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc announced it had uncovered the remains of 215 children in unmarked graves by using ground penetrating radar (GPR) at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School. A month later, the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan revealed that GPR had uncovered 751 unmarked graves at the former Marieval Indian Residential School. In 2015, when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on the legacy of Indian residential schools released its final report, it included an entire volume on lost children and unmarked graves. The answers that Ridgen and the viewing audience received didn’t stray far from the leaders’ campaign talking points, something Ridgen had anticipated. What she hadn’t anticipated, however, was the “wave that came after that.” The response to asking five people seven questions for a total of 11 minutes on air was overwhelming. “It meant a lot to so many people, Indigenous people, to be hearing the questions that have been burning in their minds for 150 years, to hear them asked on a mainstream platform, and then also just regular Canadians who have such an appetite now for reconciliation to hear us ask the questions that maybe never even occurred to them,” said Ridgen. Another unexpected wave was sparked when moderator Shachi Kurl asked Blanchet how he could defend Quebec provincial bills 21 and 96, which Kurl characterized as discriminatory in nature. Bill 96 proposed measures to reinforce the French language charter, while Bill 21 prohibits public servants from wearing religious symbols in the workplace. Blanchet went on the defensive, and then later refused to answer Ridgen’s question when she asked him about the racism Atikamekw woman Joyce Echaquan faced in a Joliet hospital before her death. Echaquan livestreamed what was happening to her as hospital staff verbally abused her. Blanchet suggested to Ridgen that systemic racism should be discussed in a private conversation. She wasn’t surprised by his non-answer, she said, but she was disappointed by both him and the other leaders. “Any of those leaders, when it came time for them—the question was put to Yves Blanchet (and) Quebec in particular has had to wrestle with this of late but— any of them could have followed up on it, pertaining to the question of systemic racism and how we address it in Canada. I just feel that it’s not a talking point they want to get into. What does that say?” said Ridgen. And when the accusation of racism issue blew up in Quebec the next day it was focused on Kurl’s question and not Ridgen’s. “Because it doesn’t affect most of the people who are talking about it. That’s my take. For people like you and I, we know that this is so stitched into every piece of Canada’s fabric; unless you live that, it’s not an issue to you. Mostly non-Indigenous journalists, where’s their priority? It’s not their aunties dying,” she said. While the debate format has come under criticism and the time allowed for Indigenous issues was limited, Ridgen says the exercise was worth it. “There’s an appetite for it now that didn’t exist before. I think there’s nothing bad that can come out of that,” she said. She hopes whoever forms the next government takes the issues raised through the questions beyond election day. The debate was also an opportunity for APTN to access party leaders, something the network has had difficulty with. Trudeau, she said, came to the APTN studio in Winnipeg in 2015 during his first campaign. He promised to come back but never has. Neither O’Toole nor his predecessor Andrew Scheer responded to requests from APTN. Singh and Paul, and her predecessors, will come in “whenever asked basically on whatever topic,” said Ridgen. As for Ridgen’s inclusion, both the Assembly of First Nations and the Manitoba Metis Federation say it was important. Ridgen is Red River Métis and an award-winning journalist. Will Goodon, minister of housing and property management for the MMF, was part of APTN’s coverage of the English debate. “Being able to ask those questions gives our issues that level of uptake into the Canadian consciousness that has never been there before because in this year, of any years, that should have been the number one issue right across the board,” said Goodon, who added he was “very, very proud” of Ridgen. AFN National Chief RoseAnne Archibald, who spoke to Windspeaker.com the day after the debate, praised Ridgen. “I think that was important to have an Indigenous woman in the debate asking those questions. The symbolism of that was very powerful and, of course, she knows the issues inside out. I just think she did an amazing job. She was fantastic,” said Archibald. Ridgen said she was recently told that APTN was not invited to the 2019 leadership debate because CBC “blocked” their invitation. “The public broadcaster, which we all pay for, which is supposed to be the wokest of the woke, opposed APTN's participation .... until our dead kids were found this summer. Then they made space,” said Ridgen. Windspeaker.com reached out to the Leaders’ Debate Commission, but received no response by deadline. APTN has been in operation for 22 years, said Ridgen, and until this debate, they were the only one of the four national broadcasters not to be included. “I feel they can’t uninvite us from the table now,” she said.

"2021-09-17","Full text: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau was in Richmond, B.C., Tuesday to flex an endorsement from former B.C. Green Party leader Andrew Weaver in an attempt to lock down climate-conscious voters. Trudeau announced nothing new at a morning press conference, but flanked by Weaver and environment minister and North Vancouver candidate Jonathan Wilkinson, he made the case that British Columbians couldn’t trust Erin O’Toole’s Conservatives on climate change. “We know the Conservatives on climate,” Trudeau said. “We lived through 10 years of cities, of provinces pushing hard to do more on climate change with a federal government that didn't just not do much, but dragged their heels and interfered with other people's ability to do more.” “Mr. O'Toole, in this newest version of the Conservative Party, (wants) to go exactly back to Stephen Harper's targets, and Stephen Harper's approaches to the environment,” Trudeau said, highlighting O’Toole’s support for the Northern Gateway pipeline, approved by Harper before it was axed in 2016. Northern Gateway is not referenced in the Conservative platform, but O’Toole has attempted to turn it into a wedge issue after Trudeau promised to cap emissions on the oilpatch. The Conservatives did not return a request for comment. With a narrow lead over O’Toole’s Conservatives nationally, Trudeau kept the bulk of his message on two points: that Conservatives would undo climate progress, and the Liberals are best positioned to deliver on climate goals. But, sensitive to progressive voters in B.C., Trudeau looked to knock the NDP down a peg, too."

"2021-09-16","Full text: Having a provincial statutory holiday to remember Canada's colonial history and reflect on the relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people is long overdue, says Timmins MPP Gilles Bisson. Starting this year, Sept. 30 will mark National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. In June, legislation was passed to make Sept. 30, which is already recognized as Orange Shirt Day, a federal statutory holiday. It was created in response to one of the 94 Calls to Action in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Federal agencies and most Crown corporations will be closed for it. While Ontario has announced the day won’t be a provincial holiday, some municipalities are marking it. Bisson said the day would give people an opportunity to raise awareness, reflect on the “good and bad” between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people and allow people to think about how to move forward to build a better future. The MPP said he doesn’t understand why Premier Doug Ford didn’t make Sept. 30 a statutory holiday in the province. “There is no good reason for them to say no. I think it sends exactly the wrong message that Mr. Ford and the Conservatives need to send to the rest of our communities, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal,” Bisson said. “Because there are a lot of people in our communities who support this concept, who want to do better when it comes to First Nations. I think Mr. Ford on this one is offside.” At a press conference Tuesday, NDP leader Andrea Horwath called on Ford and Minister of Indigenous Affairs Greg Rickford to mark Sept. 30 and make it a statutory holiday in the province to honour those affected by residential schools and acknowledge the ongoing trauma. Horwath was joined by Kiiwetinoong MPP Sol Mamakwa and Toronto Centre MPP Suze Morrison. “So that we can honour the lives lost, acknowledge and identify the responsibility that Canadians had, the government of the day had in terms of using the tools of genocide against Indigenous peoples. And make sure we never forget,” Horwath said at the press conference. “We can’t just walk away from this. We must always remember, and this day will help us do that.” The Ontario NDP caucus made Sept. 30 a paid day off for all its staff and would make the day a province-wide stat holiday if elected in the June 2022 provincial election, according to the party’s press release. A 24-hour residential school crisis line offering support to former students and their families is available at 1-866-925-4419.

A release from the Lheidli T’enneh (klate-LEE' ten-eh) First Nation says it has formally requested a ministerial order to reroute the pipeline, which lies across 130 kilometres of its territory and 1.5 kilometres of its Fort George No. 2 Indian Reserve. One edge of the reserve is less than 500 metres from the site where the pipeline ruptured and exploded in October 2018, terrifying nearby residents.

"2021-09-16","Full text: The Village of Clive will close its office every Sept. 30 as its council voted to officially recognize the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. The decision was made at the Sept. 13 regular meeting of council. Village Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Carla Kenney presented councillors with a report on the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, which has been recognized by the federal government as a statutory holiday. Sept. 30 is also known as “Orange Shirt Day” and according to Wikipedia “...is designed to educate people and promote awareness in Canada about the Indian residential school system and the impact it has had on Indigenous communities for over a century—an impact recognized as a cultural genocide, and an impact that continues today.” However, Kenney noted the Government of Alberta doesn’t recognize the holiday and left it up to municipalities to decide whether to give employees the day off or not. Kenney’s report listed all federal and provincial holidays and noted Clive has traditionally adopted all federal statutory holidays through its personnel policy. The CAO noted she contacted some other municipalities to see how they’re handling the Sept. 30 holiday and it seems approaches vary. Some are not recognizing the day, others are using the day for indigenous awareness training and some are adopting it as a statutory holiday. Coun. Jeremy Whelan stated he thought some indigenous communities will begin offering programs on Sept. 30 and making the day a holiday would give staff a chance to attend those. Coun. Susan Russell stated Canada Day and Thanksgiving are statutory holidays so the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation should be too. Mayor Lucy Henry stated it was nice to hear councillors voice support for reconciliation with the indigenous community and added that Clive is known to be an inclusive community. Councillors approved adding the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to the list of statutory holidays the Village of Clive recognizes. Vaping stays at home Councillors read a report from Kenney on vaping in the village. Kenney noted the village relies on provincial law to handle tobacco use in the municipality, but Clive does have a cannabis bylaw. The bylaw limits cannabis use to homes only. The CAO stated provincial law prohibits smoking and vaping in public buildings and many other places. Coun. Norma Penney suggested adding a note to the village utility bills reminding residents about the rules surrounding tobacco and vaping. Councillors accepted Kenney’s report for information. CAO report In her regular report to council Kenney stated within the utility billing department five “high consumption” notices have recently been sent out to some residents. The CAO stated three of them were related to yard watering and two were likely due to water leaks. With the municipal election coming up in October, Kenney noted four candidates have confirmed they will run for spots on Clive council, including incumbents Lucy Henry, Tracy Hallman and Norma Penney along with newcomer Dan Graden. Kenney stated that a few other nomination packages went out but have not been returned. The village received a complaint about lack of dust control for a portion of Westling Road south of 51st Ave. However, Kenney stated there are no residents nearby and residents are the ones who pay for dust control. She also noted the lift station work is expected to be done in late 2021 and was delayed by a generator delivery. As well, the new village water line is currently under construction from Alix. Councillors accepted Kenney’s report for information. Urban hen bylaw Councillors passed first reading of the village’s revised bylaw which oversees the ubiquitous urban chicken. Councillors previously agreed to increase the number of hens each residence may have up to six. The bylaw will now be publicly advertised and return for consideration to a future council meeting.

Two-dozen protesters gathered on the sidewalk in front of the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre in Halifax yesterday, many of them voicing concerns about the proof-of-vaccination system set to take effect next month. And police controlled a crowd of protesters at Calgary's Foothills Medical Centre, ensuring patients and staff could enter the facility safely. Federal party leaders Justin Trudeau, Erin O'Toole and Jagmeet Singh all denounced protesting outside hospitals and intimidating or harassing health-care workers and patients. Trudeau also pledged to make it a crime to block access to health-care facilities.

"2021-09-16","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Sept. 14 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 14... What we are watching in Canada ... With less than a week before the federal election, a new poll shows Justin Trudeau's Liberals and Erin O'Toole's Conservatives in a dead heat. The poll conducted by Leger in collaboration with The Canadian Press shows both parties tied with the support of 32 per cent of decided voters, with the NDP in third place with 20 per cent. A similar poll conducted two weeks ago had the Conservatives ahead with 34 per cent compared with 30 per cent for the Liberals and 24 per cent for the NDP. The polls cannot be given a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples. The leaders are back on the campaign trail today after spending yesterday sharpening their attacks, with O'Toole painting his opponent as privileged and entitled — saying while Trudeau was ""partying,"" he was doing search-and-rescue missions in the military. Trudeau accused O'Toole of engaging in ""personal attacks,"" and insisted his own actions could not be compared to the Tory leader's, even while arguing O'Toole has ""proxies"" in the anti-vaxxer movement, without providing concrete evidence. --- Also this ... A verdict is expected today in Linda O'Leary's trial, two years after a deadly boat crash in central Ontario. The wife of celebrity businessman Kevin O'Leary has pleaded not guilty to one charge of careless operation of a vessel under the Canada Shipping Act. Linda O'Leary was at the helm when the boat collided with another vessel on Lake Joseph on Aug. 24, 2019, as the couple and a family friend were returning to their cottage after a dinner party. Two people on the other boat -- Gary Poltash, 64, of Florida, and Suzana Brito, 48, from Uxbridge, Ont. -- died from their injuries. Three others were also hurt. O'Leary's defence lawyer, Brian Greenspan, has argued his client should be cleared because there is evidence the other boat's lights were off at the time of the incident, rendering it essentially ""invisible."" However, witnesses who were on the other vessel, including a man who was charged with failing to exhibit a navigation light, testified they remembered some lights being on. A police officer also told the court during trial that O'Leary registered an ""alert range'' blood alcohol level in a breath test shortly after the crash. The officer testified O'Leary told her she had only had one drink, and it was after the crash. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... MATHER, Calif. (AP) — U.S. President Joe Biden is using his first western swing since taking office to hold out the wildfires burning across the region as an argument for his $3.5 trillion rebuilding plans. He is calling year-round fires and other extreme weather a climate change reality the nation can no longer ignore. With stops Monday in Idaho and California, Biden sought to boost support for his big rebuilding plans, saying every dollar spent on “resilience” would save $6 in future costs. And he said the rebuilding must go beyond simply restoring damaged systems and instead ensure communities can withstand catastrophic weather that doesn’t strike based on partisan ideology. “Even some of my less believing friends are all of a sudden having an altar call,” Biden said of those who have sought to minimize the risks posed by climate change. “They're seeing the Lord.” In Boise, he said: “It’s not a Democrat thing. It’s not a Republican thing. It’s a weather thing.”"

"2021-09-16","Full text: B.C. vaccine card could loosen restrictions: Henry VANCOUVER - British Columbia's top doctor says she hopes the COVID-19 vaccine card system that came into effect Monday could support the loosening of some pandemic-related restrictions, including indoor capacity limits, in the coming weeks. The system means additional restrictions in the Interior Health region, such as limits on gatherings, are being revised to allow for exemptions in places where proof of vaccination is required, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said. In place until at least Jan. 31, the card is a tool to help protect as many people as possible from COVID-19 ""so we can get as much open as possible and get back to doing the things that we need and love,"" Henry told a news conference on Monday. Anyone who wants access to a range of non-essential indoor services must show proof of at least one dose of a vaccine, with a second shot required by Oct. 24. The digital or paper vaccine card is required at settings like ticketed sports events, concerts, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, casinos, gyms and movie theatres. The card is not required at grocery and liquor stores, pharmacies, fast food restaurants, salons, hotels, banks, retail stores, food banks and shelters. The response among members of the Surrey Board of Trade has mostly been positive, CEO Anita Huberman said, though a handful of businesses have said they would not follow Henry's order to check for proof of immunization. Some claim they don't have the resources to implement the system, seeing it as yet another rule imposed by the provincial government after 18 difficult months of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, Huberman said. ""It's a new process and yes, it's one added layer that a business has to engage in, but necessary so that businesses don't shut down,"" she said in an interview. Meanwhile, Huberman said the operator of a live music venue in White Rock recently told her that 20 per cent of people who had bought tickets for an upcoming show had cancelled because they didn't want to show their vaccination status. The vaccine card has spurred protests, including outside hospitals in B.C. Henry said she recognizes some people find the vaccine card ""difficult,"" but she's disheartened they find it's OK to take out their frustration on health workers. ""Our health-care workers across B.C. are day in and day out providing the care we need in sometimes extremely stressful situations, and they continue to care for people, no matter what their vaccination status is."" B.C.'s emergency departments and intensive care units are strained with the added burden of COVID-19 patients, she said, most of whom haven't been vaccinated. While some in the business community have expressed concern that would-be patrons who are upset about the vaccine card could threaten the safety of staff, Premier John Horgan has told businesses to call law enforcement if necessary. A provincial guide to the vaccine card for businesses shows fines can range from $230 to $575 for individuals, depending on the violation, while event organizers, owners and operators could be fined $2,300 for failure to comply with the system. Asked about threats businesses have received from those who oppose the vaccine card, Henry said they have no choice but to require it. ""It really stuns and saddens me to think that people would find that an acceptable way to express their frustrations over something as important as trying to keep people employed, trying to keep businesses open, trying to keep people safe,"" she said. ""These are the businesses that have suffered the most through this pandemic and the people who work there are deserving of respect."" Health Minister Adrian Dix said the vaccine card provides people with opportunities to gather and participate in activities that have been restricted throughout the pandemic and threatening others for following the law is ""despicable."" Nearly 86 per cent of eligible residents in B.C. over the age of 12 have received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 78.4 per cent have received both shots. Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba have also introduced vaccine passport programs. Showing proof of vaccination is not required to vote in the Sept. 20 federal election.

"2021-11-18","Full text: Carney urges retraining, investing in workers The time is now for Canada to invest in retraining to help workers affected by the transition to a greener economy, former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney said Monday. ""(We need to ensure) that the resources of a country, Canada in this case, can be properly dedicated to retraining, to building the resources of the future, to reinvest in the areas that are undergoing these adjustments,"" Carney said. ""And now is the time to do it – not at some cliff-edge point down the road when there is a sharper adjustment.” Carney — the UN special envoy on climate action and finance — made the remarks at the International Economic Forum of the Americas Montreal conference. The event is taking place this week, less than two months before the next UN climate conference is scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland. Sustainable finance, or how to use the power of the financial sector's trillions of dollars in assets to help achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, will be on the agenda at the UN event, known as COP26. Carney — who also chairs the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which unites more than 160 banks and asset management firms worldwide — wants to see banks, insurers and investors commit to ensuring their investments and lending is aligned with net zero goals. He also wants to see governments participating in COP26 make climate-related financial disclosures mandatory for the corporate sector. As global efforts to combat climate change increase, Carney said there will need to be a way for investors and lenders to finance the run-off of stranded fossil fuel assets in their portfolios. ""There is a time path for various assets that cannot make it to the entire end of their working life, because that would be inconsistent with the overall objective of getting to net zero,” he said. But while the possibility of stranded assets is a risk for energy companies worldwide as policies are brought in to reduce emissions, that doesn't mean there aren't capital opportunities for the sector. Carney said he expects the flow of capital to the global energy sector will need to double over the next 25 years to about $4 to $5 trillion annually to help companies transition to renewables and expand the use of technologies such as carbon capture and storage. ""The financial sector will need to work with businesses to get capital ... to those who are going to be part of the solution,"" he said. Thousands of workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador have already lost jobs in the oil and gas sector due to consolidation and downsizing. Some business and labour groups say these provinces need federal support to diversify their economies and retrain workers. The Alberta Federation of Labour, for example, has been lobbying for federal support in the range of $10 to $20 billion per year to help oil-producing provinces and their workers diversify. The labour group would like to see a new federal transfer program that could fund green infrastructure projects, training and apprenticeships in affected provinces. As part of its federal election campaign, the Liberal party has proposed a $2-billion ""Future Funds'' program for the three oil-producing provinces to ensure workers aren't left behind as Canada pursues its climate change commitments. The party's platform contains a promise to create a ""Clean Jobs Training Centre'' to help oilpatch workers upgrade or gain new skills. The federal Conservative Party has criticized Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau for ``wanting to phase out the (oil and gas) sector and its jobs.'' It says a Conservative government would support energy sector workers. The NDP platform pledges to ``work together'' with labour, employers and the provinces to find solutions that could include expanded EI benefits, retraining and job placement services The percentage of Alberta's labour force that has been unemployed for more than one year is 2.4 per cent, the highest rate of long-term unemployment in the country (the national average is 1.4 per cent).

"2021-09-15","Full text: Woodlands County Council held a special meeting on Thursday, September 9, to discuss how the group would meet for the next while. Alicia Bourbeau, Director of Corporate Services, explained that changes laid out by the Province of Alberta on September 4 reinstated some of the masking initiatives that were previously in place. ""Administration is before Council today to understand your desire for how to hold meetings in the future, in light of the new regulations that have been implemented by the Province."" There are two regularly scheduled meetings for Woodlands County Council before the October election, September 21 and October 5. ""We're wondering if Council has the appetite to make those virtual meetings as we await further instruction from the province,"" spoke Bourbeau. She said that some committee meetings that had already been advertised as face-to-face meetings would become hybrid meetings instead. ""We will make certain that electronic-type means are available, and if individuals are unable to do the meeting electronically or prefer to come into the office because it was advertised that way, we will just ensure that our social distancing is as good as the Province recommends, if not better."" Mayor John Burrows asked what the options were for being in person. ""We could still hold the special meetings, but we'd have to make adaptations to the council chambers to put barriers in or mask, or both. What's the specific recommendation from the Province?"" Bourbeau explained that Administration was within the guidelines. ""If you are not sitting stationary in your office, then you are masked as moving about through the building. We do have space within Council Chambers to increase the distance between members, and wearing masks would be the recommendation."" She added that they have looked into getting barriers but that the timeframe before the next meeting (September 21) might be too tight to get them installed. Mayor Burrows stated that a face-to-face meeting was much more effective. ""You get to see a lot more and get to communicate a lot clearer. We've been dealing with these virtual meetings for quite some time, and we have good bandwidth and good capability to do it now, so we can certainly continue with them."" He said that in-person was his preference but would go either way, based on the rest of Council. Councillor Ron Govenlock, who had previously brought up his concerns with safety protocols at in-person meetings, spoke up. ""We're trying, I think, to skirt the conversation that took place at the last council meeting with regard to in-person council meetings and that safety protocols need to be in place at Council Chambers. The motion that was put forward at that particular time was to ask Administration to come back with a legal opinion, which I'm assuming is going to be on the agenda for the next council meeting."" He said that having that item on the next agenda would create an opportunity for ""further debate on what safety protocols need to be implemented throughout the county."" He said that he didn't have any issues with virtual meetings for the next bit. ""The understanding that I have is that COVID isn't going away and that the safety protocols include plexiglass barriers between council members as well as possibly plexiglass barriers between the entire council and the chambers."" He said that he felt unsure if Administration would be looking at all the various safety protocols. ""I think the issue isn't going to go away just because we go from in-person council meetings to virtual council meetings. Somewhere along the line, people need to have the opportunity to have conversations with the residents and the council as a group. I expect that conversation and that material will be on the September 21 agenda, and I'm not sure if the Administration that is present will confirm that or not."" Councillor Govenlock was referring to the fact that CAO Gordon Frank was not present in the meeting. His question of whether the next meeting's agenda would include his inquiry into the legal options available to Woodlands County, specific to attendance at council meetings, was not answered. The group voted unanimously to move Woodlands County Council meetings to the online format. The public can watch meetings live on the County's YouTube platform and watch the most recently recorded session. However, previous meetings are typically deleted once a new meeting takes place. Unlike the Town of Whitecourt, Woodlands County had continued streaming their meetings live even after they returned to in-person attendance. Subject: Meetings; Councils; City ordinances"

"2021-09-15","Full text: Dawn Mills is not sure she can afford school supplies for her daughter this year. She says that it may come down to a decision between fresh fruits and vegetables and school notebooks. Mills, a Cambridge resident, is used to making these decisions. Due to her disability, she cannot work, and is on the Ontario Works social assistance program living off of just over $1,000 a month. But even with that assistance, the rising cost of living is making basic needs more and more unattainable. “The cost of food, I’m pretty sure it’s risen, especially fresh fruits and vegetables,” said Mills. “Gas prices are almost $1.40 a litre, which makes it even tighter for me.” A poll from Abacus Data cites cost of living as the No. 1 issue that Canadians are focused on with the upcoming Sept. 20 election. With Statistics Canada reporting that inflation rates have reached 3.7 per cent, the affordability crisis is only getting worse. The pandemic is a main factor in increasingly high inflation rates, with consumer spending bouncing back faster than production and transportation capacity, causing a surge in prices. For many, housing in particular has become out of reach or hard to hold onto. Lori Brady can relate to this. Brady, who lives in Cambridge and has a disability and multiple health conditions that prevent her from working is on the Ontario Disability Support Program. Currently, she only gets $781 a month for housing, which forces her to turn to food banks just to keep dinner on the table. During the pandemic, extra support was scarce. Brady received just an extra $100 during the pandemic while many people collected CERB and CRB, which pays more, Brady says. “We’re not getting enough money to pay rent,” said Brady. “ODSP has not kept up with the rate of inflation ... I feel fortunate to have this apartment, but there’s still the stress everyday of not having enough.” Most of the major federal parties are running on a platform of affordable housing, with the Conservatives promising to build 1 million homes in three years; the Liberals promising to build or preserve 1.4 million homes over the next four years, and the NDP promising to build 500,000 homes over the next 10 years. But none of the parties have spoken about who would qualify for affordable housing, or how much would be set aside for people with physical or mental disabilities. Lisa McVey, a single mom of two children who makes $50,000 a year who is struggling to afford her $2,100 a month apartment in Cambridge, says there has to be more control over how much housing is costing. “I think what politicians need to do is have more rent-geared-to-income housing,” said McVey. “I’d love to know from politicians what affordable housing means to them, because my definition of affordable housing is probably different from someone who makes $100,000 a year.” STORY BEHIND THE STORY: After reading polls that cited the rising cost of living as the No. 1 issue on voters' minds, reporter Genelle Levy reached out to Waterloo Region residents to get their perspective on the rising cost of living."

"2021-09-15","Full text: Elisapee Sheutiapik said her goodbyes to the legislative assembly Thursday, announcing she won’t be seeking another term as MLA for personal reasons. During her speech in the legislature, she mentioned deaths and illness that had affected her during her time in office, referring to her sister’s murder, which is still unsolved 30 years later, her nephew who committed a murder-suicide, leaving behind two daughters, her partner Brian Twerdin, who is undergoing cancer treatment and suffered from a stroke, and her biological mother dying. “I’ve gone through a lot and, obviously, a lot of deep emotions. And it’s OK to say,” she said in an interview. “I think it’s just best not to commit to a new term at this point.” Sheutiapik won her seat in the legislature on October 2017. She served as minister of family services and was also responsible for the portfolios of homelessness, poverty reduction and the status of women. Prior to that, she was the mayor of Iqaluit from 2003 to 2010, president of the Nunavut Association of Municipalities, and Pauktuutit, the national organization representing Inuit women in Canada. Sheutiapik said that not running again was a tough decision to make and that there were days she thought she could run again. Ultimately, she said there are too many unknowns in her life right now. During her speech, Sheutiapik spoke about the importance of training Nunavummiut for work. She said she is not a high school graduate, “but look at the training I had received and look what I’ve done with it.” She thanked elders who had impacted her during her time as a minister and MLA, and colleagues who had supported the Department of Family Services. Her message to other MLAs and Nunavummiut is to recognize mental health as an issue in the territory and admit when a break is needed. “Our brain is part of our body. We seem to neglect it for some reason,” she said. Sheutiapik said she and Twerdin are heading south this Sunday for his second-last round of treatment, and she is going to focus on her family and business, Grind and Brew. “I’ve always said, even in the leadership forum, we need to be healthy first for us to help. So my family needs me to make sure it’s healthy right now.” Sheutiapik is the third prominent MLA to announce she won’t be running again. Former speaker Paul Quassa stepped down in August along with former minister Pat Angnakak, who is now the Liberal candidate in the Sept. 20 federal election. Subject: Legislatures"

Anyone who wants to access a range of non-essential indoor settings must show proof of at least one dose of vaccine with a second shot required by October 24th. The digital or paper vaccine card is required at settings such as ticketed sports events, concerts, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, casinos, gyms and movie theatres. The card will not be required at grocery and liquor stores, pharmacies, fast food restaurants, salons, hotels, banks, retail stores, food banks and shelters -- and it's not required for voting in the September 20th federal election. (The Canadian Press) --- (BC-Fiscal-Update) (watch for dating, press conference at 11 a.m.) B-C's finance minister is set to provide an update this morning on the province's finances, economy and first quarter results from April to June. The last update from Selina Robinson showed the COVID-19 pandemic was battering the province's bottom line, but the effects hadn't been as bad as feared. She reported in July that the deficit of close to 5.5 billion dollars for the fiscal year that ended March 31st was nearly three billion lower than forecast. The 2021-22 budget released in April forecast a deficit of 9.7-billion dollars followed by at least two more years of billion-dollar deficits.

Speaking from a hotel in Vancouver, O'Toole pledged to extend employment insurance benefits to parents for up to eight weeks following the death of a child. He said a Conservative government would also provide up to eight weeks of paid leave after a stillbirth and three days following a miscarriage. O'Toole made an explicit pitch to women -- a demographic that has traditionally leaned more Liberal than Tory -- saying he wants to make sure they can look at the Conservative party as a strong option to help their families.

The injunction granted is set to expire later this month -- four months after police enforcement began and more than a year after the blockades were first set up. The R-C-M-P say officers have made at least 989 arrests since May, including 110 people who've been arrested more than once. (The Canadian Press) --- (BC-Police-Shooting) Police on Vancouver Island say B-C's police watchdog has been called to investigate after an officer fatally shot an armed man yesterday morning. They say officers in Saanich responded to a report of a man who was armed, in crisis, making threats and who allegedly stole from a nearby liquor store. A statement from police in neighbouring Victoria says they engaged with the man for about an hour until an ""interaction"" occurred and an officer shot him. They say officers and paramedics gave first aid, but the man died at the scene -- the Independent Investigations Office has been notified. (The Canadian Press) --- (BC-Employment-Scams) The Better Business Bureau of Mainland B-C says reports of employment scams have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many involve cryptocurrency. The scams involve job seekers being hired by fake businesses that go on to steal their personal information or ask them to commit fraud as part of the so-called job. In one example, the bureau says a West Vancouver man accepted a credible-looking job offer he received by email and on his first day, he was asked to deposit three-thousand dollars from the supposed company into a Bitcoin A-T-M. The bureau recommends people research job offers thoroughly and create a separate bank account for pay received from employers they've never met.

Some high-ranking Ontario politicians and prominent health-care organizations are issuing warnings ahead of a number of protests expected to take place at hospitals across Canada today.

TORONTO — Two titans in the theatre business head to court in Toronto today in what could well be a multi-billion dollar test case for pandemic-era litigation. Toronto-based Cineplex is seeking to recoup $2.18 billion in damages from Cineworld Group PLC after the U.K. theatre giant scrapped its planned purchase of the Canadian cinema chain. Cineworld walked away from the December 2019 takeover deal amid strict economic lockdown measures in June 2020, alleging material adverse effects and breaches by Cineplex. For its part, Cineplex has called Cineworld's decision to terminate the deal ""nothing more than a case of buyer’s remorse,"" and the company's statement of claim shows it will argue that Cineplex fulfilled all of its obligations. The legal battle will hinge on Cineworld arguing it had the right to terminate the agreement without payment because Cineplex strayed from ""ordinary course,"" when it deferred its accounts payable by at least 60 days, reduced spending to the ""bare minimum"" and stopped paying landlords, movie studios, film distributors and suppliers at the pandemic's start. The case, which is being heard by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, won't change Cineworld's decision to scrap the Cineplex deal, but legal and entertainment experts say it will offer a window into the future of Canadian movie-going and may inspire further suits. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... LOS ANGELES — In a blitz of TV ads and a last-minute rally, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom urged voters Sunday to turn back a looming recall vote that could remove him from office, while leading Republican Larry Elder broadly criticized the media for what he described as double standards that insulated Newsom from criticism and scrutiny throughout the contest. The late-summer weekend was a swirl of political activity, as candidates held rallies, continued bus tours and cluttered the TV airwaves with advertising offering their closing arguments in advance of the election that concludes Tuesday. Newsom — who is expecting President Joe Biden today for a capstone get-out-the-vote rally in Long Beach — was in a largely Hispanic area on the northern edge of Los Angeles, where he sought to drive up turnout with the key voting bloc. Elder also was in Los Angeles, where he was joined by activist and former actress Rose McGowan, who repeated her claims from recent days that Newsom’s wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, attempted to persuade her in 2017 not to go public with her allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Siebel Newsom’s office described the allegations as a “complete fabrication.” In a brief interview with The Associated Press, Newsom characterized McGowan’s claims as a “last-minute classic hit piece” from one of Elder’s supporters. The governor called Elder desperate and grasping, saying McGowan’s claims about his wife “just shows you how low things go in campaigns these days.” --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... BEIJING — Flights and train service were being canceled in Shanghai, China's largest city, as typhoon Chanthu moved up the mainland coast Monday after bringing heavy rain and wind to Taiwan. Local media reported all flights would be suspended from Shanghai’s two airports as of 3 p.m. (0700 GMT) Monday. Some subway lines were shut down, while classes and many offices and shops were closed for the day. The typhoon was in waters off Shanghai by mid-afternoon, with maximum winds of 151 kilometers per hour, the China Meteorological Association said. Chanthu drenched Taiwan with up to 13 centimeters of rain on Sunday as the storm’s center passed the island’s east coast with winds of 162 kph and gusts up to 198 kph, before heading north to Shanghai. After dumping rain on Shanghai, Chanthu is forecast to head a bit farther north and then tack northeast toward South Korea and Japan. The storm grazed the island of Luzon in the Philippines last week, but no flooding or damage was reported. Typhoons are called hurricanes in the North Atlantic, central North Pacific and eastern North Pacific, but are the same weather phenomenon. Typhoon In-fa made landfall south of Shanghai in late July, disrupting flight schedules and prompting evacuations for about 330,000 residents of Fengxian District on the city's southern edge. Torrential rains and flooding in July caused the deaths of at least 292 people in Zhengzhou, a major city in the central province of Henan, including some trapped in the city's subway tunnels. --- Also this ... JERUSALEM — Israeli aircraft struck a series of targets in the Gaza Strip early Monday in response to rocket launches out of the Hamas-ruled territory. It was the third consecutive night of fighting between the two sides, even as Israel’s foreign minister sought to dangle incentives for calm. Tensions have risen after last week's escape from an Israeli prison by six Palestinian inmates, as well as struggling efforts by Egypt to broker a long-term cease-fire in the wake of an 11-day war last May. The Israeli military reported three separate rocket launches late Sunday and early Monday, saying at least two of them were intercepted by its rocket defenses. In response, it said it attacked a number of Hamas targets. There were no reports of casualties on either side. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid on Sunday called for a new approach to end the cycle of fighting with Hamas, describing a plan of international investment in Gaza's infrastructure in exchange for pressure on Hamas to halt its military buildup and preserve calm. -- In Entertainment ... Lil Nas X won video of the year at Sundays MTV VMAs on a night that Canadian mega-pop star Justin Bieber triumphantly returned to the stage as a performer and as winner of the artist of the year. Much of the early show belonged to Bieber, who for his first VMAs performance in six years rappelled from the ceiling of the Barclays Center at the start of the show for an energetic performance of “Stay” with Kid LAROI and then his single “Ghost.” The VMAs celebrated MTV's 40th anniversary, mixing moments between early network stars like Cyndi Lauper and show opener Madonna with high-octane performances by newer stars like Olivia Rodrigo, Lil Nas X, Camila Cabello and Chloe. Bieber was the leading nominee going into the ceremony. He took home the best pop honor for “Peaches,” a song that featured Daniel Caesar and Giveon - who accompanied him onstage. Sporting baggy clothes and a hoodie, Bieber showed his appreciation for the awards being in-person and thanked his wife, Hailey, for supporting him. Opening the show, Madonna told the screaming crowd: “They said we wouldn’t last. But we’re still here.”"

"2021-09-14","Full text: First Nation students head to school a year behind Shamattawa First Nation chief and council made the difficult decision to shut down the reserve's only school last November after a COVID-19 outbreak devastated the remote northern Manitoba community. They hoped cancelling classes for about 500 students at Kisemattawa Kiskinwahamakew Kamik School would be temporary. But as weeks brought growing case numbers, they realized the children were safer at home. Last week, some 10 months later, students returned to the classroom. ""I know the kids are so happy,"" said Chief Eric Redhead. ""I think they feel normalcy coming back into the community and into their lives."" He said the last COVID-19 infection in the community was about two months ago. The last time students were in class, the community of 1,100 was dealing with more than 300 cases of the virus, forcing the school to be converted into an alternate isolation centre. Redhead said the education department eventually held back students from progressing to the next grade. ""There was just not enough time in class to pass everyone,"" Redhead said. Shamattawa, located about 745 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg, deals with overcrowded homes, a water system that is unable to service the entire community and inadequate internet service. Virtual learning was not an option, Redhead said, because of the unreliable internet connection and lack of computers or tablets in homes. He said he believes the decision to hold students back was a good one given the circumstances. ""I don't think it would have been fair for the kids to expect for them to learn on their own."" Redhead said, for the most part, parents were understanding of the decision. The school plans to continue with safety measures — including mandatory masks indoors, social distancing, temperature checks and frequent sanitization efforts. But Redhead said the community will resort to shutting down the school again if there's another COVID-19 outbreak. He worries about how that will affect the students' academic success and hopes the next federal government, following the Sept. 20 election, will make reliable internet for northern and rural communities a priority. Another northern Manitoba community also held back some of its students after a COVID-19 outbreak. the military was called in to help and three schools were shut down. Greg Halcrow, director of education for Pimicikamak Cree Nation, or Cross Lake, said teachers attempted to send homework packages but students fell behind without reliable internet or in-class learning. The education department came up with a dual curriculum plan for the 2021-22 school year. For the first part of the year, Halcrow said, students will repeat the curriculum for the previous grade then move into the curriculum for the current grade for the latter part of the year. ""I think it will be a challenge, but it's something we are capable of overcoming and getting these kids back on track to where they should be,"" Halcrow said. But it means 55 students who were supposed to graduate will have to repeat Grade 12 until January, he said. Graduates will then have a chance to enter a transitional period before heading to post-secondary schools in the fall of 2022. ""It's not all doom and gloom,"" said Halcrow. ""There are opportunities that have presented themselves. That is how we're approaching this year."" Garden Hill First Nation, located about 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, had said in May it would have to hold students back due to the pandemic. Ernie McDougall, who was recently hired as the new director of education for the community, wouldn't confirm if that's still the case for the 2021-2022 school year. He said the move was still being discussed within the education department.

A letter sent to provincial officials says the plan restricts access to certain indoor settings for people who can't get their shot for medical reasons, while failing to provide a workaround for people without government I-D. The director of the B-C Poverty Reduction Coalition, Rowan Burdge, signed the letter and says carrying around a smartphone or a piece of paper displaying proof of immunization is just not going to work out for many people who are homeless. The Health Ministry says there will be an exemption process for people who cannot get vaccinated due to medical reasons -- but it adds that B-C's top doctor has said indoor settings with many people are high risk right now for anyone who doesn't have their shots. (The Canadian Press) --- (BC-FedElxn-Singh) Jagmeet (JUG'-meet) Singh has revealed how much the N-D-P's election promises would cost over the next five years, saying the 214-billion dollar price tag would be funded largely through tax hikes for the wealthiest people and businesses. The federal leader told a press conference in Vancouver on Saturday the N-D-P is the only party with a plan to help make life more affordable for everyday people while ensuring the most affluent Canadians and corporations pay their fair share. Healthcare is the most costly area, with proposed spending totalling 68-billion dollars to pay for N-D-P proposals including universal pharmacare, investments in long-term care, and dental and mental health coverage for those who need it. The platform projects 166 billion in revenues over five years based on estimates from the Parliamentary Budget Office and it outlines how Canada's debt as a share of G-D-P would decline under an N-D-P government. (The Canadian Press) --- (BC-Vancouver-Assault) Police in Vancouver are asking the public to be vigilant after they say a 76-year-old woman suffered life-threatening injuries during a violent sexual assault. Constable Tania Visintin says the woman hasn't been able to tell police exactly what happened due to the extent of her injuries, including significant facial bruising. Visintin says police were called Thursday by staff at the woman's care home and they believe the assault may have occurred between last Tuesday and Thursday. The suspect is described as a white man with a stocky build, between 30 and 35 years old, with light to dark brown shaggy hair and stubble.

The Mounties say the S-U-V passed through the same intersection at 82nd Avenue and 128th Street around the time of the shooting shortly before 9 p-m on Thursday. They say the driver of a black sedan reached out the window and fired two shots after an officer activated their emergency lights and attempted to pull the car over. They say the officer was shaken but not physically injured.

The department didn't say how many hornets were in the nest, but says in social media posts that a third nest was found and plans are underway to destroy it too. All of the so-called ""murder hornet"" nests have been located within a few kilometres of each other in a county directly south of Washington's border with British Columbia. The hornets can grow up to five centimetres long and at least one has been spotted this summer in Langley, southeast of Vancouver.

"2021-09-14","Full text: Anthony Martin, a 19-year-old from Kingsley, N.B., near Fredericton, didn't expect to spend the end of summer campaigning as a candidate in the Canadian federal election, but that's precisely what he's doing. Martin said the Green Party of Canada approached him to become the candidate for Tobique-Mactaquac, and he ""felt it was the right thing to do."" Three days before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Rideau Hall to kick off the election, Martin officially became the candidate for the vast New Brunswick riding in western New Brunswick. While only 19, Martin is aware of the issues and understands voters' concerns, especially young voters. ""It's only up from here,"" he said. Martin understands he faces an uphill battle to win the hearts, minds and votes of Tobique-Mactaquac residents, but he firmly believes in Green Party policy and will happily share that message. ""I'm not going to lie, looking at the polls, this doesn't seem like a Green area, but the reception has been good,"" he said. Soon after accepting the nomination, Martin said many people reached out to him, bringing support and volunteers. Because of the late start, the teenage candidate took a while to get into full campaign mode. He said the campaign began with its first order of 50 signs, but they ""blew right through those."" Speaking to the River Valley Sun on Thursday, Sept. 9, Martin said he and Xavier von Gröning, his partner and campaign manager, were on the road to deliver a new order of signs throughout the riding. As he hits the campaign trail, Martin said the environment appears to be the pivotal issue, adding people understand the Green movement offers a solid environmental and climate change program. He said climate change moved to the forefront of people's consciousness as they witnessed wildfires, hurricanes and flooding across the country and around the globe. However, Martin said climate change is only one of the many voter concerns. He said the country and province face ""a huge affordability issue."" ""People are worried about putting food on the table,"" he said. ""If you can't feed yourself, it's difficult to worry about climate change."" He said people watch prices rise without pay increasing at the same rate. Martin said health care remains a considerable concern for Tobique-Mactaquac voters. As a 19-year-old in good health, he doesn't always personally see the lack of health-care services. However, he said, the process his grandmother, who has Parkinson's disease, faces when trying to renew prescriptions raises concern. ""I can only imagine how hard it is for someone new to the province or has lost their family doctor and trying to get a new one. It's a huge issue,"" he said. Martin said New Brunswick's large senior population adds pressure to the provincial health-care system, but it also indicates broader provincial issues. He said youth must leave the province to seek opportunities. Meanwhile, the entire province feels the impact of staff shortages in the health-care system and the entire workforce. He said one of the reasons he chose to support the Green Party is because it is the only party to offer free tuition and the only party to forgive all federal student loan debt. ""I know that's a lot of money, but think about how many more doctors we could have if people could afford to go to school to become doctors,"" Martin said. ""Plus, to grow the economy, business needs an available workforce."" As Canadian individuals, small business and industry, including farming and forestry, adapt to more environmentally friendly operations, they will require help, said Martin. While he admits not having all the answers, he said the government must invest in innovative technologies and ensure that businesses can access those innovations. ""The reference I use a lot is we had to use candlelight to invent the light bulb,"" he said. Martin welcomes the rollout of electric cars but says innovation can't stop there. He noted that the trucking industry, an economic force in his riding, constantly has transports on the highway. Where there's no innovative technology available to replace what industry is using, he said, research must continue. ""We have to continue what we're doing, but doing it in a way that is less harmful to the environment,"" he said. Beyond economic and environmental challenges, Martin believes MPs should represent the entire community, and be leaders in the fight against oppression. He expressed disappointment in incumbent Conserative Tobique-Mactaquac MP Richard Bragdon’s decision to join 62 other Conservatives voting against Bill C-6, which would ban conversion therapy. He said that decision demonstrates a lack of support for the members of the LGBQ+ community in his riding. Subject: Climate change"

"2021-09-12","Full text: Liberal candidate Jennifer Grenz says her goal is to get the concerns of the North Island-Powell River riding heard in Ottawa, so government efforts on the economic recovery from COVID-19 and climate change issues, especially the recovery of wild salmon on the West Coast, meet voters' needs. Grenz, an Indigenous scholar and business owner who has worked on ecological restoration and invasive species management in communities across the Vancouver Island riding for the past five years, says she has witnessed coastal communities struggling with big issues that need more attention. “With the direct impacts of things like climate change, COVID-19, and reduced salmon stocks, I’ve been watching ways of life slipping from friends' hands,” Grenz said. “And if I have an opportunity to serve, I want to help bring solutions home and get people a seat at the table in government.” A scientist with public policy experience, Grenz said she’s a bridge-builder who can help stakeholders on tough issues agree on a shared course of action. “The environment and climate change can actually be super contentious, and shouldn’t be,” she said. “I’ve worked with people of all political stripes extensively on important issues, and have a reputation for being able to bring together unsuspecting allies (who) are actually united by values that they never realized they share.” The Liberal Party’s proposed climate change plan builds on its reputation for prioritizing global warming and the environment, and is the most accountable, comprehensive proposal pitched by all the parties this election, Grenz said. And while in Ottawa, the Liberals made a historical $647-million investment to recover Pacific salmon, she said. A Liberal government will want feedback from coastal communities on every aspect of the Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative, such as developing jobs in hatcheries or fish habitat restoration, added Grenz, who said her overarching goal is to build resilient communities by addressing intertwined economic, social, and climate issues. “In politics, it seems to me there’s this siloing of issues like the climate from housing and jobs,” she said. “I’m looking from an ecologist's worldview at the relationships between all of those things and … where can they be strengthened.” The Liberal Party is committed to combatting climate change while fostering a green economy and sustainable jobs, Grenz said. And applying an Indigenous lens and traditional knowledge to tackling big-picture problems like climate change, adaptation strategies, and sustainable resource development is a priority for the Liberals, said Grenz, whose family is from the Lytton First Nation. “My life’s work has been dedicated to healing our lands and waters … and our fish and animal relations can’t keep up with the changes,” she said. “The Indigenous worldview that I apply has a lot to offer in coming up with solutions for all sorts of things that are important to our communities and how we weave those things together.” Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada's National Observer Subject: Coronaviruses; Climate change; COVID-19"
"2021-09-12","Full text: Today in History - Sept. 23 Today in History for Sept. 23: On this date: In 63 B.C., Roman emperor Augustus Caesar was born. In 1122, the ""Concordat of Worms"" was reached in Germany between Pope Callistus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. It settled the controversy over who had the right, bishop or emperor, to choose church positions. The emperor was guaranteed the free election of bishops and abbots by the church and the Pope granted Henry the right, in Germany, to be present at elections and to invest those elected with their lay rights and obligations before their consecration. In 1578, English explorer Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed from Plymouth, England, in search of the Northwest Passage. In 1595, Spain began a missionary campaign in southeastern North America. During the next two years, about 1,500 Indians were converted to Catholicism. In 1780, British spy John Andre was captured along with papers revealing Benedict Arnold's plot to surrender West Point to the British. In 1787, the site of Toronto was purchased from the Mississauga Indians. In 1789, the United States Supreme Court was created. In 1806, the Lewis and Clark expedition returned to St. Louis more than two years after setting out for the Pacific Northwest. In 1817, Spain signed a treaty with Britain to end the slave trade. In 1846, Neptune, eighth planet from the sun, was discovered by German astronomer Johann Galle. In 1871, Louis-Joseph Papineau, leader of the French-Canadian patriotes and organizer of the Rebellion of 1837, died at age 84. Although Papineau is known as the godfather of liberalism in Quebec and one of the forefathers of the Parti Rouge, he was not actually present at the uprising and fled to France in 1839. In 1873, the first convention of delegates from labour unions from Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa met in Toronto to form the Canadian Labour Union. The Ontario-based organization strove to improve the working conditions of employees. It disbanded in 1878 after failing to become the national federation it set out to be. In 1908, the University of Alberta opened in Edmonton with 37 students. In 1926, Gene Tunney scored a 10-round decision over Jack Dempsey to win the world heavyweight boxing title in Philadelphia. In 1939, Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis, died in London at age 83. In 1973, Juan Peron was elected president of Argentina. In 1985, federal Fisheries Minister John Fraser resigned over the ""tainted tuna"" affair, in which he authorized the sale of rancid tuna over the objections of his department's inspectors. Fraser was elected Speaker of the House of Commons the following year. In 1987, free trade negotiations between Canada and the United States were halted. Ottawa disagreed with the U.S. positions on culture, regional development and settling trade disputes. Negotiations resumed and the deal was signed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Jan. 2, 1988. (The deal took effect Jan. 1, 1989.) In 1987, Saskatchewan became the first English-speaking province to ratify the Meech Lake accord. In 1998, a team of European and Australian surgeons performed the world's first arm and hand transplant in Lyon, France. In 1999, British and American scientists announced they had found a way to reverse menopause through ovarian tissue grafts that would let older women bear children. In 2007, famed Canadian artist Ken Danby died at age 67 while canoeing in Algonquin Park in Ontario. Danby was recognized as one of the world's foremost realist artists and was best-known in Canada for his hockey painting, ""At The Crease."" In 2008, a 22-year-old gunman killed 10 people at a school in Kauhajoki, Finland, the country’s second such attack in less than a year. In 2009, a Supreme Court judge in B.C. threw out polygamy charges, the first in Canada, against leaders of two rival factions, Winston Blackmore and James Oler, in the community of Bountiful in B.C.’s interior, saying the government did not have the authority to pursue them. (In August 2014, a special prosecutor approved polygamy charges against the two.) In 2010, movie renter Blockbuster Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. (It was bought by Dish Network Corp. in April 2011 for US$228 million in cash. Blockbuster Canada was placed into receivership in May and closed 146 locations in June. In early September, it announced the remaining 253 stores were scheduled to close after failing to find a buyer willing to invest in the business.) In 2011, ABC aired the final episode of the daytime soap opera ""All My Children"" after more than 40 years. (It was reborn online on April 29, 2013 but was cancelled later that year.) In 2017, the Invictus Games Toronto 2017 got underway. The international sports competition was founded by Britain's Prince Harry as a way to inspire and motivate wounded soldiers on their path to recovery. In 2019, British tour operator Thomas Cook fell victim to multiple setbacks including shifting travel habits, the rise of online booking sites, the sinking pound and even unusually hot weather that encouraged fewer Northern Europeans to travel. Specific problems of its own, like a 1.6 billion-pound ($2 billion) debt pile, made it less able to react to change. It all added up to a perfect storm that led the 178-year-old company to cease operations, stranding hundreds of thousands of travellers. Analysts said Thomas Cook, which rode a package holiday boom that started in the mid-1980s, was too slow to react as consumers moved away from buying trips at bricks-and-mortar stores. The company did push into online business, with 48% of its bookings from the internet as of last year. But not fast enough. Online rivals, meanwhile, didn't have to bear the costs of owning 200 hotels, 500 travel agency shops and 105 airline jets, but acted as middlemen. In 2019, The man who wrote the poetic words for many of the Grateful Dead's finest songs died at 78. Robert Hunter played a number of instruments but never appeared on stage with the group. His lyrics featured on some of the band's most memorable songs, including ""It Must Have Been the Roses,'' ""Terrapin Station,'' ""Cumberland Blues,'' and ""Friend of the Devil.'' The family did not release a cause of death. In 2020, Hall of famer Gale Sayers, one of the best all-purpose running backs in NFL history, died at 77. Sayers was also celebrated for his enduring friendship with Chicago Bears teammate Brian Piccolo during Piccolo's battle with cancer. Their story was made famous in the 1971 movie ""Brian's Song,"" starring Billy Dee Williams as Sayers and James Caan as Piccolo. In 2020, the throne speech from the Liberal government promised to introduce or greatly expand COVID-19 benefit programs and supports for nearly every sector of society. Among them, extending the federal wage subsidy program into 2021 and targeted support for businesses hardest hit by the pandemic. The Conservatives said the plan has no measures to control government spending and they would not support it. In 2020, in an address to the country, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the second wave of COVID-19 was already underway. He said families won't likely be able to gather for Thanksgiving, but it was not too late to save Christmas. (Cases continued to rise throughout the fall and winter, leading officials to discourage Christmas gatherings as well.) ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Coronaviruses; Prime ministers; COVID-19"
"2021-09-12","Full text: --- (FedElxn-Campaign) With just 10 days to go before election day on September 20th, federal party leaders are back on the campaign trail today after throwing proverbial stones at each other in two back-to-back leaders' debates. Heading into the debates, polls suggested the Liberals and Conservatives were locked in a dead heat, with smaller parties poised to determine which of the main parties emerges victorious. N-D-P Leader Jagmeet Singh sasays for the good of all Canadians, he'd be willing to co-operate with other parties in a minority government.

"2021-09-12","Full text: For Green Party candidate Jessica Wegg, the climate crisis is the focal issue of the upcoming federal election and the lens through which every other important issue should be examined. The past year is rife with examples of the dire impacts of anthropogenic global warming, said the human rights lawyer running in the North Island-Powell River riding in British Columbia. In B.C. alone, a record-breaking heat wave led to hundreds of deaths, triggered the massive die-off of tidal creatures and withered crops, as well as aggravating an already vicious wildfire season in the Interior that levelled towns and homes, Wegg said. “It is out of control, and we need to make sure we are doing every single thing we can to protect people from the changes that are already present, and to prepare for them in the future,” she said. “We have to stop the bleeding.” The Greens are best-suited to tackle the climate crisis, and is the sole federal party to renounce any expansion of the fossil fuel industry, Wegg said. “No new oil, no new fossil fuel exploration or extraction, shutting down TMX (pipeline project), and no more fracking,” she added. “All the big things we have to do in order to meet the goals required to stop climate change from going over the brink.” The party recognizes other priorities, but they must be examined in conjunction with global warming, Wegg said, citing housing and reconciliation with Indigenous people as examples. “The climate is the one priority that touches on everything,” she said. Housing and homelessness are critical issues, but it’s not enough to build houses if those homes aren’t adapted to deal with fire risks or heat waves, she added. “We need to look at housing and how we can also keep people safe in their homes.” And reconciliation with Indigenous people and honouring their rights and title include recognizing Indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by negative impacts of climate change, as well as the need to incorporate traditional knowledge in protecting territories and resources, she added. “We can learn so much ... from these traditional stewards of the land and waters, and how best to take care of them.” Wegg’s prior legal work involved working with prisoners denied medical care or victims of mistreatment or brutality, and she wants to continue to advocate for marginalized voices. She currently is an executive member of the parent advisory council (PAC) at her son’s school and is working and learning about Indigenous legal issues and treaty rights. She said she decided to run for office to ensure she took every measure she could to effect positive change. “I wanted to be able to say that I have done everything in my power to make the world a better place,” she said. “And this is something that I am qualified to do, and I'm able to do, and I'm happy to do.” Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer Subject: Housing; Native peoples; Fossil fuels; Climate change; Reconciliation"

In 1955, President Juan Peron of Argentina was ousted after a revolt by the Argentine army and navy. Peron, who became president in 1946, had played a leading role in a government coup three years earlier. As president, he set up a dictatorship and instituted a program of revolutionary and nationalistic measures which were supposed to lead to economic self-sufficiency. By the early 1950s, however, the economy had deteriorated and his support weakened. In 1957, the United States conducted its first contained underground nuclear test, code-named ""Rainier,"" in the Nevada desert. In 1968, physicist Chester Carlson, inventor of the Xerox copying process, died. He was 62. In 1978, the Progressive Conservatives, led by John Buchanan, swept to victory in the Nova Scotia provincial election. The win was the first of four straight victories for Buchanan.

Fisheries Minister John Fraser, who had earlier refused to recall the product, resigned on Sept. 23. In 1985, Mexico City, the world's most populous capital, was hit by a devastating earthquake. It was followed by another major quake the next day. Many buildings, including schools, hospitals and highrises, were destroyed and at least 9,500 people were killed. Canada immediately set aside $1 million in emergency aid to help victims of the quakes. In 1986, American officials announced that an experimental drug had prolonged the lives of some people with AIDS. The drug, azidothymidine or AZT, had first been synthesized in the 1960s, when it was hoped to be used to fight cancer. In 1988, the American Senate ratified the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement by a vote of 83-to-9. The vote marked the last step in the American legislative approval process. The agreement, aimed at eliminating trade barriers, began taking effect the following January. In 1989, the U.S. Library of Congress announced the first 25 of 75 films named to the new national film registry. The registry was established to get high-quality copies of films to make sure they would be preserved. The first group included ""Gone With The Wind,"" ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Citizen Kane."" In 2000, Reform party leader Stockwell Day was sworn in as leader of the Official Opposition, and Joe Clark, the former Conservative prime minister, returned to the House of Commons after seven years.

In 2005, North Korea agreed to drop its nuclear weapons development program and rejoin international arms treaties. In 2005, Paul Coffin, the first person to be criminally convicted in the federal sponsorship scandal, was sentenced to two years less a day, to be served in the community by speaking out publicly about business ethics and the story of his downfall. In 2005, former Tyco International Ltd. boss Dennis Kozlowski and former Tyco finance chief Mark Swartz were each sentenced to jail terms of up to 25 years for looting the company coffers. They were also ordered to pay a combined $240 million in fines and restitution. In 2007, Ontario's Superior Court struck down the province's controversial adoption information disclosure law as unconstitutional only two days after it went into effect. In 2007, Canada formalized a landmark $1.9-billion compensation deal for an estimated 80,000 former students of 130 residential schools run by churches and funded by the federal government from the 1870s until the mid-1970s, for the sexual, physical and psychological abuse they endured. In 2008, baseball's new instant replay system produced its first reversal when Tampa Bay's Carlos Pena had a two-run double changed to a three-run homer during the fourth inning of a game against Minnesota. In 2009, Wally Buono became the winningest coach in CFL history, collecting his 232nd career win to surpass Don Matthews, as the B.C. Lions defeated the Toronto Argonauts 23-17. In 2010, retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the U.S government's point man on the BP disaster, announced that the company's well was ""effectively dead'' and posed no further threat to the Gulf of Mexico. Following the April 20 explosion that sunk a drilling rig and killed 11 workers, the well spewed an estimated 780 million litres of oil into the Gulf, making it the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. In 2015, Jackie Collins, the bestselling author of dozens of novels including ""Hollywood Wives"" that dramatized the lifestyles of the rich and the treacherous, died of breast cancer. She was 77.

It happened on the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 earthquake that killed thousands. In 2017, Jake LaMotta, the former middleweight champion whose life in and out of the ring was depicted in the film ""Raging Bull,"" for which Robert De Niro won an Academy Award, died at age 95. In 2018, The leaders of North and South Korea announced a wide range of agreements that they said were a major step toward peace on the Korean Peninsula. But Kim Jong Un said he would only permanently dismantle his main nuclear complex if the United States took corresponding measures. In 2019, an Alberta mother and father who treated their ill son with herbal remedies rather than get him medical attention were acquitted in the boy's death. A judge in Lethbridge ruled that David and Collet Stephan were not guilty of failing to provide the necessities of life to 19-month-old Ezekiel, who died in 2012. The medical examiner who did the autopsy testified that Ezekiel died of bacterial meningitis, but a pathologist called by the defence said the child died from a lack of oxygen to the brain when he was in an ambulance. In 2020, former Liberal prime minister John Turner died at the age of 91. Dubbed ""Canada's Kennedy'' when he first arrived in Ottawa in the 1960s, Turner held the office of prime minister for just 79 days — the second shortest term in Canadian history. He gave up the leadership of the Liberal party in June 1990, to be succeeded by Jean Chretien. In 2020, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said he tested negative for COVID-19. In a message posted to his Facebook page, Legault said he would remain in isolation until Sept. 28. In 2020, the Mounties said an intercepted letter laced with the poison ricin, and meant for the White House, may have originated in Canada. American officials said there was no threat to the public. In 2020, Nunavut reported its first confirmed cases of COVID-19. The territory's chief public health officer said there were two cases at the Hope Bay gold mine 125 kilometres southwest of Cambridge Bay. Dr. Michael Patterson said both miners were exposed in their home jurisdictions. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Agreements; Leadership; Earthquakes; Capital punishment; Murders & murder attempts; Prime ministers"
"2021-09-12","Full text: The Assembly of First Nations (AFN) provides regular updates on the progress of the Truth and Reconciliation (TRC) calls to action (CTA), keeping tabs on governments, educational and religious institutions, civil society groups, and all Canadians for full and meaningful implementation on all of the instructions given by the commission. The CTA’s regarding educational discrepancies surrounding on and off-reserve schools, the differences that continue to occur in funding process and amounts, and Indigenous rights and culturally appropriate teachings are described by the AFN as making “moderate progress.” “Moderate progress has been made in this area. Most notably, the ongoing efforts toward the completion of Call to Action #11,” AFN’s website said. “Future budget announcements must continue to commit further funding as there is still a persistent backlog of First Nations students seeking a post-secondary education. Further progress on Action #8 is possible if the government reduces funding discrepancies between on- and off-reserve First Nations.” The Indigenous Watchdog said that “between 1996 and 2016, a 2 per cent cap on annual increases was in place; between 2004-05 and 2013-14, provincial expenditures increased roughly 2 per cent a year after adjusting for inflation (during this same period). This is in the context of declining enrolment. “Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) estimates that, nationally, the total funding shortfall for education programming in all band-operated schools in 2012-13 was between $300 million and $595 million. PBO estimates this shortfall grew to between $336 million and $665 million in 2016-17.” Indigenous Watchdog reported that on Jun. 11, 2021, the federal government posted updates to their “Delivering on the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action” website, as well as an update delivered on Jun. 7, 2021, using the phrase “Date modified.” The problem noted with this is that “not a single word had changed from the last revision to the site on Sept. 5, 2019. “Those updates, beginning on Jun. 7, began just 11 days after the discovery of 215 unmarked graves in Kamloops and the resulting outcry over the lack of government actions and resolve in addressing the TRC Calls to Action and, in particular, those relating to “Missing Children and Burial Information” (Calls to Action 71 – 76). To consciously draw attention to “modified” sections of the Calls to Action implies that something has been revised or updated and that there is progress in advancing those specific Calls to Action. The Watchdog noted that the CTA’s that were reported as “updated or revised,” were all directly related “to those areas that would draw the most attention from the media, concerned Canadians and Indigenous groups themselves given the context of the last month, the discovery of about 1,250 unmarked graves in four sites and counting.” Note: the number of unmarked graves is reported to be over 5,000 at the time of writing this article."

"2021-09-12","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Sept. 10 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 10 ... What we are watching in Canada ... Federal party leaders are back on the campaign trail today after locking horns in two back-to-back leaders' debates. It remains to be seen whether either Wednesday's French debate or Thursday's English debate moved the public opinion needle, with just 10 days to go before election day on Sept. 20. Heading into the debates, polls suggested the Liberals and Conservatives were locked in a dead heat, with smaller parties poised to determine which of the main parties emerges victorious. The English debate was fractious, its format widely panned for giving leaders little time to engage substantively with one another or to respond to barbs from rivals. Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet took umbrage with moderator Shachi Kurl, a pollster with the Angus Reid Institute, for a question he said suggested Quebec is racist and he later criticized Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau for not coming to the province's defence. Trudeau, who had rounded on Blanchet in Wednesday's French debate for questioning his devotion to Quebec, told reporters the format didn't give him a chance to respond. He reiterated his opposition to Quebec's secularism law — which Kurl had called ""discriminatory"" because it bans public servants in positions of authority from wearing religious garb or symbols — but said Quebecers are not racist. Quebec, with 78 seats, is a key battleground that could determine the outcome of the election. At dissolution, the Liberals held 35 seats in the provinces, the Bloc 32, the Conservatives 10 and the NDP just one. Hours before Thursday's debate, Premier Francois Legault all but endorsed Erin O'Toole's Conservatives, saying they'd be easier to work with than the Liberals or NDP, whom he accused of wanting to intrude on Quebec jurisdiction over health care and other matters. O'Toole has promised to transfer billions to the provinces for health care with no strings attached. The English debate represented the leaders' last best chance to sway millions of voters. It came just as four days of advance polls are set to open today. --- Also this ... OTTAWA — Forty-three Canadians were among around 200 foreigners on board a civilian flight out of Afghanistan on Thursday — the first such large-scale departure since U.S. forces completed their frantic withdrawal over a week ago. Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau confirmed the departure and number in a statement as he thanked Qatar for facilitating the special flight from Kabul to Doha, which also contained U.S., German and Hungarian citizens. “We can confirm that today 43 Canadian citizens were on board a special flight organized by the government of Qatar,"" Garneau said in a statement. “Canada has been working closely with Qatar to ensure safe passage for Canadian citizens still in Afghanistan who are seeking to leave, and we thank them for their continued support."" The 43 were among 1,250 Canadian citizens, permanent residents and family members stranded in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from the country on Aug. 30. “We are working tirelessly, including through close co-operation with our international partners, to bring home remaining Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their families and the vulnerable Afghans who have supported Canada’s work in Afghanistan,” Garneau said. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to the media, said the Taliban’s new foreign minister and deputy prime minister helped facilitate the departure. A senior Canadian official had previously confirmed those on board did not include any former interpreters and other Afghans who previously worked with Canada in the country and are now desperate to escape for fear of Taliban retribution. The official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, said the best avenue for escape for those people remains the overland route to Pakistan. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has deployed more staff to bolster the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, the official added, and more people are being sent to help there and at the border with Afghanistan. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... NEW ORLEANS — Supply trucks are once again delivering beer on Bourbon Street and the landmark Cafe Du Monde is serving beignets, fried pastries covered with white sugar, even though there aren’t many tourists or locals around to partake of either. With almost all the power back on in New Orleans nearly two weeks after hurricane Ida struck, the city is showing signs of making a comeback from the Category 4 storm, which is blamed for more than two dozen deaths in the state. More businesses are opening daily, gasoline is easier to find and many roads are lined with huge debris piles from cleanup work. Thousands are still struggling without electricity and water outside the metro area, and officials say oppressive heat is contributing to both health problems and the misery. It could still be weeks before power is restored in some areas, and many residents who evacuated haven't returned. “It is not lost on anybody here at the state level and certainly not on our local partners just how many people continue to suffer,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said Thursday. “While things are getting better and we can be thankful for that ... this is going to be a very long-term recovery.” Around New Orleans, residents are seeing signs that life is getting back to normal after Ida. Philip Palumbo, who lives in the French Quarter and works at a bar that remains shuttered, said the citywide curfew being lifted should help restaurants and bars struggling to reopen get more customers. “There’s not a lot around yet, but they’ll be back,” he said. Power crews reached a “major milestone” in the New Orleans area by restoring electricity to the vast majority of customers. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... BANGKOK — A strong typhoon skirted past most of the Philippines on Friday but appeared to be gaining strength and heading directly for Taiwan this weekend, forecasters said. Typhoon Chanthu still had the potential on its current course to hit the extreme northeastern portion of Cagayan province in the Philippines with sustained winds of 195 kilometers per hour and gusts up to 240 kph before moving onward toward Taiwan, the country’s meteorological agency said. As Chanthu moves west-northwest past the Philippines, current forecasts are that it will most likely hit the east coast of Taiwan on Sunday morning, with the potential of hitting the island head-on if it tacks more to the west, or missing it entirely if it veers to the east. Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau has issued a typhoon warning as it tracks the storm. The bureau said high waves were expected along Taiwan’s southern coast and in the Bashi Channel between its southern tip and the northernmost island in the Philippines. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said Chanthu is forecast to intensify up to 205 km/h over the next 12 hours, before slightly weakening ahead of reaching Taiwan. “Further weakening will begin on Sunday as the typhoon begins to interact with the rugged terrain of Taiwan but will remain within typhoon category throughout the forecast period,” the agency said. --- On this day in 1937 ... More than 1,500 cases of infantile paralysis — polio — with 58 deaths were reported in Canada in an epidemic that began in June. --- In entertainment ... TORONTO — The Toronto International Film Festival is welcoming Hollywood celebrities back to the red carpet as organizers look to revive the event's big-screen magic in spite of pandemic precautions. TIFF kicked off with the premiere of musical ""Dear Evan Hansen"" at Roy Thomson Hall on Thursday night, ringing in a return to theatres after the COVID-19 crisis largely limited last year's festival to digital and drive-in screenings. But even as the global glitterati once again graced Toronto, the 10-day hybrid festival seemed to lack some of the star-powered fanfare of previous years. Director Stephen Chbosky said he's had a special relationship with TIFF since his first studio film, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" debuted at the festival in 2021. Chbosky said having ""Dear Evan Hansen"" open this year's pandemic-tailored festival felt like ""coming home."" ""We didn't even know if there was going to be a TIFF,"" he said. ""We just went for the first crowd, hundreds of people in the audience. I'm still kind of buzzing from it. It's remarkable."" Based on the Tony Award-winning musical, ""Dear Evan Hansen"" sees Ben Platt reprise his Broadway role as a socially anxious high school student who gets caught up in a web of deception following the death of a classmate. Platt, Julianne Moore and Amandla Stenberg were among the actors in attendance at the gala. But rather than being greeted by throngs of fans, the cast was shielded from public view as they walked the red carpet. The trio did take a bow before the audience after Thursday night's screening, taking to the stage with Nik Dodani, Colton Ryan and Danny Pino. But many star gazers reported a dearth of celebrity sightings outside the heavily guarded venue. --- ICYMI ... NEW YORK — Canada's newest teenaged tennis hero is headed to the U.S. Open women's final. Leylah Fernandez, of Laval, Que., fought back from an early 4-1 first-set deficit to narrowly defeat Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus 7-6(3), 4-6, 6-4, securing her first-ever shot at a Grand Slam title. The 19-year-old fan favourite got off to a slow start in Thursday's semifinal match, struggling at first to even make contact with the No. 2 seed's blistering pinpoint serves and a fearsome cross-court forehand. But by the time she broke Sabalenka to take a 4-2 lead in the third set, it was clear the 73rd-ranked Fernandez wasn't going anywhere without a fight — an attitude she'll take into Saturday's final against 18-year-old Emma Raducanu of Great Britain. Her U.S. Open experience so far, she said, ""has helped me not only to believe in my game, but it also has helped to open my eyes that I have no limit to my potential,"" Fernandez said after the match. As they've done almost from the outset, the fans — some of them decked out in Canadian flags and T-shirts hand-lettered with the name ""Leylah"" — cheered her like a hometown favourite, an advantage that at times appeared to be getting on Sabalenka's nerves. Meanwhile, No. 12 seed Felix Auger-Aliassime of Montreal plays No. 2 Daniil Medvedev of Russia in the semifinals on the men's side today. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 10, 2021 Subject: Debates; Pandemics; Citizenship; Military withdrawals; Festivals; COVID-19"

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has deployed more staff to bolster the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, the official added, and more people are being sent to help there and at the border with Afghanistan. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is running for re-election as the Liberal candidate for University-Rosedale, said during a virtual news conference that Canadian officials “are working on having more people be able to come home through a variety of different routes.” Retired major-general Denis Thompson, one of several Canadian veterans working to get Afghans who previously worked with the Canadian military mission in Afghanistan out of the country, said the Qatar Airways flight was encouraging. Thousands of former interpreters, cultural advisers, drivers, cleaners and other locally engaged staff with links to Canada remain trapped in Afghanistan, and Thompson said reopening the Kabul airport is the best way to get them out of the country. Qatari envoy Mutlaq bin Majed al-Qahtani said another 200 passengers will leave Afghanistan on Friday. A diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said foreigners, including Americans, will depart in the next couple of days. The Taliban have repeatedly said foreigners and Afghans with proper travel documents could leave. But their assurances have been met with skepticism, even with the departure of the Qatar flight. As Taliban authorities patrolled the tarmac Thursday, passengers presented their documents for inspection and dogs sniffed luggage laid on the ground. Some veteran airport employees had returned to their jobs after fleeing during the harrowing chaos of the U.S.-led airlift. Irfan Popalzai, 12, boarded the flight with his mother and five brothers and sisters. He said his family lives in Maryland. “I am an Afghan, but you know I am from America and I am so excited"" to leave, he said. Before the flight took off, Qatari officials gathered on the tarmac to announce the airport was ready for the resumption of international commercial flights after days of repairs. Extensive damage in the frenzied final days of the U.S. airlift that evacuated over 100,000 people had raised questions about how soon regular commercial service could resume. Experts from Qatar and Turkey have been racing to restore operations. “I can clearly say that this is a historic day in the history of Afghanistan as Kabul airport is now operational,” said al-Qahtani, the Qatari envoy. “Call it what you want, a charter or a commercial flight, everyone has tickets and boarding passes,” he added. “Hopefully, life is becoming normal in Afghanistan.” The flight was the first to take off from the Kabul airport since American forces left the country at the end of August. The accompanying scenes of chaos, including Afghans plunging to their deaths from the sides of military aircraft on takeoff and a suicide bombing that killed 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members, came to define the end of America’s two-decade war. Al-Qahtani said the airport’s radar is now active and covering some 112 kilometres after U.S. forces left it inoperable. Authorities co-ordinated with Pakistan as they tried to fix control over the airspace, he added. Flights are restricted to daytime hours. The airport is also no longer the Hamid Karzai International Airport, but rather simply Kabul International Airport, with the name of the country's former president removed. Several Taliban white flags flew from the terminal, which was emblazoned “The Islamic Emirate seeks peaceful and positive relations with the world."" Hundreds of other Afghans who say they are at risk for helping the Americans have gathered for more than a week in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, waiting for permission to board chartered evacuation flights. Many of them are believed not to have the necessary travel documents. Despite skepticism around the world, the Taliban have promised that Afghans who worked for the Americans will not be targeted.

"2021-09-12","Full text: The Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) has taken its concerns about being ignored by the Trudeau government to the United Nations. This morning, CAP filed a formal legal complaint with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. It states that because the Canadian government refuses to consult with the organization on Indigenous Affairs more than 800,000 people are left unrepresented. That is the figure used by director Lorraine Augustine, chief and president of the Native Council of Nova Scotia, which she says represents the number of Indigenous people who live off reserve. “(Canada has) continued to fail to allow CAP and its constituency to take part in the conduct of public affairs through (the constituents’) fairly chosen representative group,” said Augustine in a news conference this afternoon. However, she could not offer a number as to how many of those people belong to the CAP organization. “Membership has nothing to do with it… We have a constituency just like other governments and those are the ones that we represent,” she said. “At the end of the day, we’re there for them if they need our help.” CAP National Chief Elmer St. Pierre said the congress is one of five national Indigenous organizations, but for the past five years the Justin Trudeau government has recognized only the Assembly of First Nations, the Métis National Council and the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. Recognizing only these organizations leaves specific Indigenous groups unrepresented, said St. Pierre. “MNC, their definition of a Métis, you have to come from the Red River Settlement and we all don’t come from the Red River Settlement. That is their body of Métis people. With CAP it doesn’t matter where you came from. You’re a Métis… and we represent them,” said St. Pierre. He also said there were status First Nations people who live off-reserve and didn’t want to be represented by the AFN. St. Pierre said despite reaching out to the Prime Minister, Trudeau has not had contact with CAP for the past five years. Trudeau and the Liberal government were elected for their first term in 2015. CAP was founded in 1971 as the Native Council of Canada. It had a strong relationship with Trudeau’s predecessor, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his Conservative government. Harper considered CAP one of the four representative national Indigenous organizations. When Harper was seeking election in his first term in 2006, CAP supported his campaign. Harper appointed CAP’s then-national chief, Patrick Brazeau, to the Canadian Senate in 2008. “This here (legal action) is a wake-up call (to Trudeau),” said St. Pierre. “Our people suffered every day under his power.” The 51-page document filed with the UN by CAP against Canada is “submitted for consideration under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” Canada entered into the operational protocol in 1976. The CAP document states that “Canada has failed to engage with or meet the needs of its urban Indigenous people” by not engaging with them or CAP “adequately or at all in consultation or negotiations” on a variety of issues, including self-government, land claims, healthcare, education, infrastructure or natural resources. As a result, states the claim, Canada has violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. CAP states its claim can be heard by the UN, because no national remedies exist that would be adequate, available or effective. CAP cites a challenge by the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC) that went to the Supreme Court in 1994. NWAC challenged the federal government’s decision to exclude them from constitutional discussions. NWAC lost. “The precedent established by this case makes it unlikely that CAP could succeed on a direct challenge to the distinctions-based approach,” states the claim. “The Supreme Court of Canada has already determined that no particular Indigenous group has a right to be heard and dealt with by the Federal Government in its policy decisions, even where that right has been extended to other Indigenous groups who cannot or do not effectively represent all viewpoints.” St. Pierre said “Filing this lawsuit … was never an easy decision but calling out hypocrisy is always the right thing for our people.” Augustine was unclear of the process now that the claim had been filed. “(We) will have to wait and see what happens next … We’re hoping that it will follow suit and continue and (they will) hear what we need to say and definitely hear our complaints,” she said. Augustine anticipated hearing something within six weeks. Windspeaker.com Subject: Councils; Prime ministers; Native North Americans"

"2021-09-12","Full text: Former Reeve of the RM of McKillop, Howard Arndt, says it appears he has been acclaimed for the Division 5 agricultural seat recently vacated by Bill McKenzie. Arndt served as Reeve from the fall of 2016 to the Spring of 2018 in the RM until he resigned. The resignation followed significant upheaval after taxes doubled for some residents spurring protests. The province got involved, conducted a review of the RM, and appointed an administrator to oversee the RM for a year. There was a referendum that saw division boundaries redrawn, and a new council was elected. The government’s review found no evidence of theft, fraud or misappropriation of funds. In a 2019 byelection, Arndt ran for the Division 1 seat, losing to Don Whitrow. Arndt was contacted to confirm the information. He said he submitted his papers before the 4 pm deadline on September 8th. He said he was informed that no other submissions had been made for the seat and waited until the deadline had lapsed. Arndt said he received a call from a staff member saying that they had received an email from the CAO confirming that Arndt was the new councillor. When asked what this meant for the RM, Arndt said, “It means that the RM council is going to get a conscience. I have no intentions on creating any fights or battles. I am just going to ensure people know exactly what’s happening at council.” Arndt said in theory, he may not be sworn in until the election date in October; he intends to be at the next council meeting on Tuesday, September 14th.

"2021-09-11","Full text: The Liberal Party has a goal to make every building in Canada net-zero by 2050, but without timelines, dollar figures, or other details in its platform, experts worry the plans won’t make it off the page. In its platform released last week, the Liberals said in order to hit net-zero by 2050, nearly every building will have to be retrofitted, presenting an opportunity to launch a “vibrant retrofit economy.” To achieve this, the Liberals are pledging a suite of measures, some of which are new, and some of which were promised in 2019 and never implemented. Its highlights include launching a net-zero building strategy, $40,000 interest-free loans for deep retrofits, a net-zero building code by 2025, and the mention of “Energiesprong,” which refers to a well-respected Dutch retrofit program. “Overall, the Liberals’ plan does not move as quickly as we need to move on retrofits,” said Robin Tress, a climate campaigner with the Council of Canadians. “There's quite a focus on individual action as opposed to public assistance and services, and everything in this plan, as far as I can see, is voluntary, not mandatory,” she said. “And most of the promises they have made don't have money attached or many details to go with the promises.” Tress also flagged the $40,000 interest-free loan for deep retrofits as a recycled promise from 2019. It “didn't materialize between the last election and now, and so while it sounds kind of neat, I don't know what to make of it because we've heard this promise before and the Liberal Party hasn't delivered on it,” she said. Homes and buildings are responsible for 13 per cent of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions, the third-highest sector behind oil and gas, and transportation. Those three sectors are also the three that have had the most emissions growth since 2005. In a recent report, the Pembina Institute estimates that a renovation wave over the next two decades could create 200,000 well-paying jobs, and create $48 billion in economic activity each year. The report also estimates that it will take $15 billion annually for residential buildings, and $6 billion annually for commercial and institutional buildings, to support that wave. The report recommends Ottawa commit $10 billion to $15 billion annually, in partnership with provinces, to jump-start the renovation wave. “We tallied all the programs we could find — whether provincial, federal, or utilities — and right now, we've got about $1.5 billion a year in various forms of subsidy going into that sector,” said Pembina Institute's director for buildings and urban solutions Tom-Pierre Frappé-Sénéclauze. “So ballpark, we're talking about a tenfold increase in the scale of the investment we need.” Frappé-Sénéclauze said public dollars should be used for the type of deep retrofits that are needed for climate targets because there isn’t always the business case for it, particularly when it comes to switching from fossil fuels to electricity in some regions. “That's because fossil fuels are super cheap, in part because they've been subsidized massively over the course of their development,” he said. Peter Amerongen, a co-founder of Retrofit Canada and a managing partner with net-zero Edmonton-based home builder Butterwick, said the piecemeal approach to making buildings more efficient (like installing new windows or new insulation) can make it more challenging to take the important step to net-zero. That’s because the components of a building are designed to last decades, and 2050 is fast approaching. “We need to start with the premise that every building ... we touch needs to be zero-carbon long before 2050,” he said. Net-zero building codes, promised by 2025 in the Liberal platform, would help steer that transition, but Tress said, why wait? “The conversation around creating a net-zero emission building code is not new, and so if the Liberals were treating the climate emergency like a true emergency, they would be proposing to introduce that building code next year,” she said. Frappé-Sénéclauze said the lag between when new national building codes are set and when provinces adopt them is all the more reason to accelerate the timeline. “Frankly, all new construction is the easiest problem to solve,” he said. “The most straightforward thing to do ... in jurisdictions where there is cleaner electricity … is make sure all of the buildings are fully electric. “There's no rationale for new construction to continue to be connected to a natural gas system when we know that we're already going to have a huge challenge converting all the buildings that are existing that are on gas to a clean resource.” The Liberal Party platform says if re-elected it would “launch a community-led net-zero homes initiative that supports projects that pursue multiple concurrent retrofits in a community or neighbourhood, to reduce overall costs,” adding the program would be modelled on “Energiesprong.” Launched by the Dutch government in 2010, Energiesprong is a way to do deep retrofits that bring a home to net-zero — without the people who live in the home having to leave. It works by taking a 3D scan of the building, and then new energy-efficient walls and roofing are prefabricated off-site, and quickly installed on the outside of the building. “It’s so brilliant … it is hyper-efficient, it's hyper-insulated, there's very little unintentional air leakage, and you can do them on big residential buildings, like public housing, without people having to move out,” said Tress. The Dutch had a lot of postwar social housing buildings that were built at the same time, in similar shapes, and owned by social housing entities that could cheaply borrow money from the government, explained Frappé-Sénéclauze. It’s “not quite cost-effective yet,” he said, “but they had a big scale-up of it, and they had several large construction companies take on that challenge and reduce the cost.” Tress and Amerongen both said another benefit of a massive deep retrofit program would be the number of jobs it creates. “We’re going to need an army,” said Amerongen.

"2021-09-11","Full text: Anger with status quo is the reason Green Party of Canada candidate Chris Kowalchuk is running. ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore,"" he said. The 59-year old from Oakville boasts a 40 year history as an activist at all three levels of government. He worked briefly as a lift supervisor at Glen Eden in the 1980's. Kowalchuk is running against Nadeem Akbar for the Conservative Party, Muhammad Riaz Sahi for the NDP, Sibli Hadad for the People's Party of Canada (PPC), and incumbent Adam van Koeverden representing the Liberal Party of Canada. He believes the Green Party's platform will be good for Milton voters because it's driven by science and brings decision making to a local level, including on the CN Intermodal. ""A Green mandate would ensure that the local community has first say on where development happens in their community, as Milton's representative, the priority would be to make sure the 325 conditions are met,"" Kowalchuk said. The CN Intermodal was approved by the federal cabinet in January with 325 different conditions. Green Party of Canada leader Annamie Paul has been calling for a coordinated national strategy to fight COVID-19 since last year. Kowalchuk believes hyper-partisanship between the Liberals and Conservatives have turned it into a political football between federal government and the provinces. ""A proactive and non-partisan approach is the Green party is the Green Party way"", he said. The Green Party's economic platform addresses some of the weak spots highlighted by the pandemic. They propose a Guaranteed Livable Income, as new universal programs on childcare, and Pharmacare. A Green Party government would also bring long-term care under the Canada Health Act. The constitution assigns responsibility for running the healthcare system to the provinces, while the federal government is responsible for funding it. Climate Change is in in every facet of the Green Party platform. ""The primary tenet of Green politics is to create a sustainable economic, social, and ecological system,"" Kowalchuk explained. The platform includes measures to develop a green infrastructure, and transition the Canadian economy away from fossil fuels, as well moving to a net zero approach. The Green Party condemns the Indian Act as racist, and is committed to dismantling it. ""Greens will support Indigenous Peoples' work and efforts towards self-determination to ensure no one is left behind or excluded from their rightful heritage."" They will commit to enshrining the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP) into law. Bill C-15 was passed by the Liberals earlier this year, which calls for Canada to respect the declaration. The Green Party will also implement the calls from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They will respect the treaty rights. Why Vote for the Green Party? ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. Vote Green as if your children, and grandchildren's life depend on it, because it does.""

"2021-09-11","Full text: A largely student organized demonstration in City Park drew a crowd of roughly 100 on Wednesday afternoon. The live-streamed event led by a number of Queen's students and 350 Kingston calls on politicians gearing up for the federal election to make climate change a priority, demanding emergency-level action. The rally had a focus on the need for political action on climate change, encouraging attendees to post on social media with the hashtags #CanadaIsOnFire, #JustTransitionNow and #ClimateChangeIsReal, and to tag local politicians. The event joined a number of 350 Canada demonstrations throughout the country, with speakers noting the timing being important with Western Canada's rampant wildfire situation and a pending federal election. Vic Sahai of the NDP party was the sole local MP candidate at the rally, and said he feels presence at events like this are important for demonstrating that climate change is an important issue and motivating others to act. Sahai says we need to transition from an oil based economy to a green economy, and says we are in a perfect position to do so as we attempt to recover from the pandemic. He says that Kingston as an education hub could could be a leader in the transition. ""Queen's University could become a centre of excellence for green research,"" Sahai noted. ""St. Lawrence College could be one of those colleges that we gear up to transition oil workers into the green economy."" No other local MPs were present in person, although the Green Party did send official representatives. Stephanie Sherman, a Queen's student and organizer of the event, said young people can often feel powerless and overwhelmed by climate anxiety. She says an event like this allows everyone to demonstrate the importance of the issue. ""When stuff comes up or we see the news we just shut down, we don't want to talk about it but that's the exact opposite thing we need to do,"" Sherman said. ""When an event like this shows up people just jump to it. People are feeling the heat, they're feeling the effects of climate change."" She added that individuals can vote and demonstrate that they care about climate change, but the issue is one that cannot be solved on an individual level, but instead federally and globally. Kyla Tienhaara, Assistant Professor in the School of Environmental Studies and the Department of Global Development Studies at Queen's University, referenced a report by Indigenous Environmental Network and Oil Change International that suggests 25% of North American carbon emissions have been delayed or stopped by the action of Indigenous people. Both she and Sherman noted in their speeches that the Indigenous community pulls more than its' weight in addressing climate change, and that climate action can also be an important step in reconciliation. Tienhaara also asserted that climate change is an issue that needs to be solved with equity, and that it is directly tied to social issues. She says research indicates a shorter work week would have a positive impact on emissions. The decrease in commuting and energy used at office buildings is an obvious impact, but Tienhaara adds that a shorter work week could allow people more time and energy to live in an ecologically sustainable way. ""I know personally when I'm really stretched for time I'm more likely to get pre package food and people are more likely to drive places rather than walk or cycle,"" Tienhaara said. ""Even if this isn't something that's going to make the biggest emissions reduction it's about changing our focus from GDP growth being everything to being about a well-being economy where people are happier even if they're not living a high carbon lifestyle."" Tienhaara and organizers encouraged the crowd to show up and vote on September 20. There will be a Global Climate Strike on September 24. Subject: Emissions; Climate change; Workweeks"

(3) --- (Europe-Nuclear-Fusion) Teams working on two continents have marked similar milestones in their respective efforts to master nuclear fusion. Scientists at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in southern France took delivery today of the first part of a massive magnet so strong its American manufacturer claims it can lift an aircraft carrier. And in Massachusetts, M-I-T researchers and a private company announced this week that they, too, have successful tested the world's strongest high-temperature superconducting magnet that may allow the team to leapfrog their rivals in the race to build a ""sun on earth.""(3) --- (NewsWatch by Karen Rebot) Subject: Fatalities; Restaurants; Coronaviruses; Debates; Native North Americans; COVID-19"
"2021-11-17","Full text: Canada’s National Observer asked federal Liberal Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson about critical issues in the upcoming election, and how his party would respond to the climate crisis. (This interview has been edited for brevity.) What is the No. 1 most-pressing issue facing Canadians this upcoming term? I would say in the short term, it's about getting through the remainder of COVID. But I think the biggest challenge facing us in the next four years is the climate challenge. It is, without a doubt, an existential threat. Taking bold action — and that means not just coming up with ideas and talking about targets, it means actually putting in place detailed measures that will help us to move towards the targets that are informed by science — is perhaps the most critical thing facing us as a society. What other issues are top of mind for you? Related to the climate issue is thinking forward about how we're going to build an economy that actually will create jobs and economic opportunity for us as we move through a very significant economic transition over the coming number of decades. So, thinking very seriously and creatively about how we actually build an economy that will thrive, an economy that will work in all regions of the country, understanding that economic drivers in different areas are quite different, I think that would be the next one. The third one is an issue of particular importance for young people, which is around housing and ensuring we can create opportunities for young people to be able to rent and for many, eventually, to be able to buy homes. When it comes to the climate, where should we be concentrating our efforts? You have to start by asking: Where are the major sources of emissions? Because those are the areas where you need to make the most rapid progress. In Canada, those would be transportation, the oil and gas sector, industrial emissions, and buildings. As I have said before, those (plans) need to be detailed; they can't just be aspirational at this point. For example, in transportation, it's about building out refuelling infrastructure for zero-emission vehicles, providing subsidies for people to be able to purchase zero-emission vehicles, and using regulatory tools. We have said that by 2035, we will not have internal combustion engine vehicles sold in this country, and 50 per cent of cars sold by 2030 must be zero-emission vehicles. It's a very specific plan to reduce emissions, and we've done that in every sector — that's what you have to do if you really expect to see progress."
"2021-09-11","Full text: --- (FedElxn-Campaign-Debate-Paul)(Audio:P04) It's debate night -- again -- across the river from Parliament Hill in Gatineau, Quebec. Five federal party leaders will gather for a second night at the Canadian Museum of History for the second of two official election debates, but this one will be conducted in English. Last night's French-language debate featured such topics as climate change, health care and the COVID-19 pandemic. Green Party Leader Annamie Paul brought a personal touch to the event, noting her father's death in a long-term care home during the pandemic's second wave. After the debate, she also acknowledged the internal strife in her party — and the fact that it wasn't put to rest before the election campaign— has not been helpful.(4) --- (COVID-Hospital-Costs)(Audio:003) It's certainly not cheap to treat a COVID-19 patient. Data released today from the Canadian Institute for Health Information estimated the cost of COVID-related hospitalization in Canada, excluding Quebec, at nearly one-billion dollars between January 2020 and March 2021 -- the period covered by the report. The average cost of treating patients for the virus tops 23-thousand dollars, and could hit 50-thousand if intensive care is required. And neither of those figures includes the cost for doctors. The report says those with COVID-19 remain in hospital for about 15 days, twice as long as the typical pneumonia patient whose treatment cost is eight-thousand dollars.(4) --- (COVID-Yukon) Yukon health officials say another person has died from COVID-19, bringing the territory's total death count from the virus to nine. They say the person died at Whitehorse General Hospital and none of those who've perished from the virus were fully vaccinated. The territory has seen 697 cases since the start of the pandemic, with all but 52 of them since June. About 85 per cent of all eligible Yukon residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. (4) --- (Five-Killed-Hearing) The Alberta Review Board has reserved its decision in the case of a mentally ill man who stabbed to death five young people at a Calgary house party in 2014. The now 30-year-old Matthew de Grood was found not criminally responsible for the slayings as he was said to be suffering from schizophrenia at the time. The board heard that his psychosis is in full remission and he continues to take his medication. Now it must decide whether de Grood should be granted any new freedoms. (4) --- (Egypt-Building-Collapse) State-run media in Egypt report an apartment building collapsed Wednesday night in a city just outside the capital Cairo, killing at least three people. Rescue teams were still searching today for possible victims under the rubble of the four-storey building (in the city of Shoubra el-Khaima). A Bar Association branch announced that the dead were lawyers working in a law firm in the building owned by one of them.(4) --- (Bacon-Recall) European Butcher has expanded an ongoing recall over a possible Listeria contamination. The Toronto-area-based company is recalling its European Butcher brand Smoked Side Bacon Slices in a variety of sizes with all possible best before dates. It had previously recalled 200-gram packages of its Bacon ""Chunks"" this week, and is now amending that to include all best before dates. Both products were sold in Ontario. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is conducting a food safety investigation. Symptoms of listeriosis can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, and severe headache.

Opinion polls suggest the Liberals and Conservatives are stuck in a tight two-way race, with the N-D-P and Bloc poised to determine which of the two main parties emerges victorious. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole, N-D-P Leader Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul will participate in both debates. This could be their best chance to sway voters before election day on September 20th.

Dr. Matthew Chow with the Doctors of B-C group says it would also like to see mandated vaccines for all health-care workers. Residents will be required to display the vaccination card to access non-essential businesses starting Monday. B-C joins Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba in introducing similar programs. (16) --- (Ont-MZO-Court) An Ontario court has found the provincial government broke the law by failing to adhere to the Environmental Bill of Rights. Several environmental groups brought applications for judicial reviews over the province's alleged failure to consult with the public before enacting the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act. The Superior Court of Justice says the minister of municipal affairs acted ""unreasonably and unlawfully"" by consulting with the public months after it enacted changes. (16) --- (Five-Killed-Hearing) A review board has heard that a mentally ill man who stabbed to death five young people at a Calgary house party is a long way from being released back into the community. Matthew de Grood, who is now 30, was found not criminally responsible for the 2014 killings because he was suffering from schizophrenia at the time. The Alberta Review Board has heard that de Grood's psychosis is in full remission. A psychiatrist says transitioning to a group home is a logical next step, but he's recommending de Grood remain under a full mental health warrant instead of receiving a conditional discharge.

The Fed survey chalked it up to rising concerns about COVID's Delta variant, as well as supply chain problems and labour shortages. The Fed says the slowdown was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel and tourism in most parts of the country.

They say she knew her startup, Theranos, was nearly bankrupt and its much-hyped blood-testing technology was a flop. Holmes' defence team countered with a more heroic narrative describing her as a tireless worker who tried to develop a faster, cheaper and less invasive way to test blood samples.

"2021-09-11","Full text: Teneshia Samuel says they were “radicalized by justice and love” for their community during the COVID-19 pandemic. The equity and diversity consultant watched as homelessness and addiction grew in Peel, where the housing crisis boomed out of control. When rumours of a snap fall federal election were confirmed, they decided to run in Mississauga Centre for the NDP. They won the nomination uncontested. “I’m not the most partisan person in the world,” Samuel tells The Pointer. They said the NDP’s platform for the upcoming election reflects their values and desire to see radical change, and movement away from a system that has allowed many to fall through the cracks. Samuel has qualifications from McMaster University, Queen’s University, the University of Sheffield and Humber College. A community leader, they hold a position with Moyo Health and Community Services (formerly Peel HIV/AIDS Network) and serve on the board of directors for Black Mental Health Canada. Samuel is a Caribbean-Canadian, visually impaired and identifies as non-binary. At the heart of their motivation to run for political office is a horror at the inequity highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, permeating local, federal and international politics. Samuel’s priorities revolve around mental health and equity across Mississauga and Canada as a whole. “People who are at the bottom right now of our social system are being completely impacted by this pandemic and those at the top, billionaires, are just scraping off the cream and shooting themselves off into space,” Samuel says, taking interview questions as they rode a Mississauga MiWay bus between campaign appointments. “There is so much inequity I see and, you know, I have the honour and the blessing of having the privileged position to see from a global perspective where the energy is going, where the money is going, where the effort is going.” Although Samuel identifies with multiple marginalized groups, they are quick to point out they come from a financially stable background. This stability gives them a platform to share their own lived experience and elevate others. Housing unaffordability in Peel, where a 2020 regional report found 80 percent of residents could not reasonably afford to rent or buy, and the spiralling opioid crisis are two key priorities for Samuel. The NDP hopeful focused on the need to rebuild society’s collective mental health as we recover from the pandemic, changing how we approach age-old issues. “If we’re not doing mentally well as a nation, this is going to impact generations to come,” Samuel says. “If we don’t pass on good behaviours, if we don’t role model good behaviours, if we don’t use our voices and develop ourselves and evolve from past ideas that are no longer working for us … what are we doing? We’re being stuck in the past and we’re not evolving.” One solution suggested by Samuel is the creation of a Minister of Mental Health, a separate portfolio tasked with overseeing this growing need, which should be handled apart from broader healthcare issues that sometimes overshadow mental health, even when it comes to funding. All major federal parties have rolled out policy planks to tackle Canada’s worsening mental health situation and Samuel says communication and coordination are important keystones for any mental health recovery. “The Ministry of Health needs to appoint a Minister of Mental Health,” Samuel says. “There needs to be a communication between the Ministry of Health and other ministries across the nation.” Mississauga Centre, the riding Samuel is contesting, is even more diverse than the city as a whole. The riding is being contested by Omar Alghabra for the Liberals (The Pointer's coverage of Alghabra can be found here) and Kathy-Ying Zhao for the Conservatives (Zhao declined to be interviewed by The Pointer). Craig Laferriere is the Green Party candidate and Elie Diab will represent the People’s Party of Canada. Roughly 57 percent of the riding’s residents don’t speak an official language as their mother tongue. The vast majority are racialized, with 71 percent of locals identifying as visible minorities. Intersecting identities and potential for marginalization are key areas of advocacy for Samuel. “A lot of times QTBIPOC (Queer, Trans, Black, Indigenous, People of Colour) folks are not supported by [the] communities they come from. They come from religious communities or just very patriarchal communities that are not as open minded. I know myself, having come from an Afro-Carribean background, a very Christian evangelical background, there’s a lot of ignorance, a lot clinging to old ideas and archaic ways.” With a varied background, rooted in recruitment work for two major banks and equity consulting, Samuel has a clear idea of what political success would look like. Unusually for a prospective MP, they are not promising to funnell dollars into transit projects or local infrastructure priorities, instead Samuel wants to implement data monitoring through the lens of oppression to identify where policies succeed and when they are failing. “At heart, I am an academic, I am a researcher, I am a business person too, having worked in banking,” they explained. “We can’t do anything or make any kind of change without data, without audits. When we know exactly what we need and how to administrate that, then we can move forward. First 100 days [will involve] bringing more race-based data, more religious-based data, more data based on identifiers like being Black, Queer, trans, non-binary, disabled.” Samuel suggests a federally regulated system of equity monitoring could be implemented. Disaggregated data could be used to understand if policies are working for everyone, allowing the government to zero-in on groups it is leaving behind. Rather than issuing surveys and audits to marginalized groups, asking them to chronicle their pain, Samuel hopes an automated system could eventually run itself. Dispassionate data could highlight key problems automatically. “We can only all benefit from a data collection system like that,” Samuel says. “Automation, for example, in banking has become just an explosion right now in terms of collecting consumer data … the Canadian government is so much behind on collecting data on who’s who and what the gaps are and what services need to go to who.” Email: isaac.callan@thepointer.com"
"2021-09-11","Full text: Nova Scotia to introduce vaccine passport system HALIFAX - Nova Scotia on Wednesday became the latest province to announce what officials are calling a ""proof of vaccination policy"" to allow residents to participate in non-essential activities. The move comes after chief medical officer Dr. Robert Strang last month expressed concerns about enacting such a vaccination requirement. At the time, Strang said the province wasn't looking to impose a vaccine passport due to legalities, adding that individual businesses or organizations could decide to employ them if they wished. Now, provincial officials have announced that as of Oct. 4, people 12 and older will have to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 to go to restaurants, gyms, theatres, concerts and sporting events. Strang said he understands some are concerned about getting the vaccine. ""We are not requiring anyone to be vaccinated. You will remain having a choice,"" he told reporters. ""But we are still in the midst of a global pandemic that has taken countless lives, and an individual's right to choose has to be balanced with our collective responsibility to keep one another safe."" Though such measures are commonly known as vaccine passports, Premier Tim Houston said the province was going with the more specific ""proof of vaccination"" term. ""Words matter. This is a policy, a policy designed to keep people safe,"" he said. Health officials also announced the province will be ready to move into the final phase of its COVID-19 recovery plan next Wednesday, which involves removing most of the public health measures that have been in place since the onset of the pandemic. That means indoor masking mandates, gathering limits and physical distancing rules are set to be lifted as the vaccination rates edge toward 75 per cent, Strang said, though officials are encouraging residents to voluntarily continue their mask use. He said he is confident the province can reach the 75 per cent vaccination threshold by next Wednesday. ""The fourth wave is gaining steam and we can expect to see ongoing COVID activity during the fall,"" Strang said, ""however I truly believe Nova Scotia is ready. We have shown we can do what needs to be done in the past, and our vaccination rates are among in the highest in the world."" To date, about 72 per cent of Nova Scotians are fully vaccinated, according to the most recent provincial data. Fully vaccinated residents will no longer have to isolate, unless directed by Public Health, if they are found to be a close contact of a COVID-19 case, he added. Border measures will remain in place, however. Starting Thursday, domestic travellers who aren't fully vaccinated will need to isolate for at least seven days and provide two negative tests, while international travellers will no longer have to fill out the Nova Scotia Safe Check-In form as federal monitoring has improved. Masks will continue to be worn in schools until Sept. 20. Nova Scotia health officials reported 14 new cases of COVID-19 Wednesday and 11 more recoveries from the disease. Nova Scotia has 61 active reported infections and one person in hospital with the disease. Strang said there continues to be no sign of community spread of COVID-19 in the province. Nova Scotia Liberal Leader Iain Rankin released a statement Wednesday saying he was pleased Houston's government was following the lead set by the Liberals. During the recent election campaign won by the Progressive Conservatives, Rankin committed to introducing a vaccine passport if re-elected. ""This is what the Nova Scotia Liberal party staunchly advocated for to keep Nova Scotians safe when COVID-19 cases started to rise in other parts of the country, and to keep businesses open in the wake of a fourth wave,"" Rankin said Wednesday.

"2021-09-11","Full text: North American stock markets move lower TORONTO - Canada's main stock index moved lower on economic growth concerns, while the loonie fell after the Bank of Canada warned of risks but left interest rates unchanged. The Federal Reserve's latest survey of business conditions, called the ""Beige Book,"" pointed to slower economic activity in July and August, mostly related to growing worries about COVID-19 variants. September is a seasonally weak time of the year while a slowdown raises concerns for companies that have lapped easy comparisons from the prior year when activity was suppressed by the virus. ""Those are things that should be broadly understood by the market, but nonetheless, when they come out, you certainly do see pressure on equities, and that's what we're seeing today,"" said Mike Archibald, vice-president and portfolio manager with AGF Investments Inc. The S&P/TSX composite index lost 64.84 points to 20,741.79. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 68.93 points at 35,031.07. The S&P 500 index was down 5.96 points at 4,514.07 while the Nasdaq composite was down 87.69 points at 15,286.64. The S&P 500 was down for a third-straight session, possibly a signal that buyers are getting tired after markets have climbed about 20 per cent this year, Archibald said in an interview. ""I've been expecting that we would see some consolidation in the marketplace for a while. It hasn't happened. So maybe we're getting to a point in time where the buyers just kind of spent all their money and they're just going to be a little bit patient here and so, let's just see what happens over the coming days,"" he said. Archibald described the mid-week market decrease as a ""run of the mill pullback"" that is expected of equity markets. ""It's not like we're getting a real huge correction here. It's just a little bit of broad, broad-based weakness in broader equity markets."" Growth stocks and the resources sector were under pressure on Wednesday. The technology sector was also weaker, losing 1.3 per cent. A report about Amazon developing a point of sale system for third-party sellers pushed Shopify Inc. down 3.6 per cent and Lightspeed off 1.8 per cent. Energy lost nearly one per cent even though crude oil prices rose and natural gas prices surged to their highest level in seven years. The September crude oil contract was up 95 cents at US$69.30 per barrel and the October natural gas contract was up 35 cents or 7.6 per cent at US$4.91 per mmBTU. That helped Tourmaline Oil Corp., which gained 2.4 per cent, but Crescent Point Energy Corp. shares lost 2.9 per cent. Natural gas prices were helped by inventory concerns for the coming winter after a hot summer that elevated air conditioner use. ""To the extent that inventories are starting to get drawn down, there could be a bit of a shortage in the winter season, and so you saw a big move back up to seven-year highs on natural gas prices,"" Archibald said. The loonie fell after the Bank of Canada warned about risks even as it kept its interest rate unchanged. The Canadian dollar traded for 78.89 cents US compared with 79.23 cents US on Tuesday. The central bank warned the fourth wave of the pandemic and supply bottlenecks could weigh on the economic recovery. Yet it continues to expect the economy to strengthen in the second half of the year. Archibald doubts bank governor Tiff Macklem will say much during a Thursday speech given that the country's in the midst of a federal election. ""He doesn't want to appear to be politicking with respect to central bank policy, but it would seem likely to me that they'll probably take down guidance on growth in Canada after the election."" Materials was down 1.1 per cent with First Quantum Minerals Ltd. off 7.5 per cent and Hudbay Minerals Inc. down six per cent. The December gold contract was down US$5.00 at US$1,793.50 an ounce and the September copper contract was down 4.9 cents at US$4.23 a pound. Health care decreased 2.8 per cent as shares of Canopy Growth Corp. lost six per cent. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 8, 2021.

"2021-09-10","Full text: Premier Doug Ford announced in a news conference on Sept. 1, that the province is launching an enhanced vaccine certificate and verification app, to be implemented beginning Sept. 22, with a second stage planned for Oct. 22. As of Sept. 22, Ontarians will need to be fully vaccinated (two doses and a waiting period of 14 days after the last vaccination) and provide proof of vaccination, along with photo identification, such as a driver’s license or health card, to access certain public settings and facilities. These settings are described as higher-risk indoor public sites, where face coverings cannot always be worn and include: Restaurants and bars, excluding outdoor patios, delivery and takeout Nightclubs, including outdoor areas of the establishment Meeting and event spaces, such as banquet halls and conference/convention centres Facilities used for sports and fitness activities and personal fitness training, such as gyms, fitness and recreational facilities with the exception of youth recreational sports Sporting events Casinos, bingo halls and gaming establishments Concerts, music festivals, theatres and cinemas Strip clubs, bathhouses and sex clubs Racing venues (e.g., horse racing) The vaccine certificate system does not apply to employees in these settings. These mandatory requirements would not apply to outdoor settings where the risk of transmission is lower, including patios, with the exception of outdoor nightclub spaces, given the risk associated with the setting. Essential retail, like grocery stores, are exempt, as are places of worship and hair salons, along with other personal care businesses. Deputy minister Christine Elliot said regardless of their vaccine status, ""at no time"" will people be denied food from grocery stores or medical attention. Ford said “enforcement will rely on bylaw officers, will be reasonable and will rely on individuals and businesses to do the right thing.” Individuals can access their proof of immunization by downloading or printing their vaccine receipt from the provincial booking portal, or by calling the Provincial Vaccine Booking Line at 1-833-943-3900. If an Ontarian received their first of second dose out of the province, they should contact their public health unit to update their records and receive proper documentation. Aligned with public health measures currently in place, indoor masking policies will continue to remain in place. Ford said he and other premiers have asked the federal government to implement a nationwide passport, citing it would be better to have one passport rather than 10, but was told it wouldn’t happen during an election. Because of this, the province has decided to create their own. He said this is a temporary tool, that “we won’t use a day longer that we have to.” The system is needed to keep hospitalization numbers down and avoid another lockdown. Ford said Ontario is confronting its greatest enemy yet , the Delta variant, and we “find ourselves facing a fourth wave of COVID-19 as we enter the fall months and people return indoors.” “As the world continues its fight against the Delta variant, our government will never waver in our commitment to do what’s necessary to keep people safe, protect our hospitals and minimize disruptions to businesses,” said the premier. “Based on the latest evidence and best advice, COVID-19 vaccine certificates give us the best chance to slow the spread of this virus while helping us to avoid further lockdowns. If you haven’t received your first or second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, please do so today.” “We need to protect our hospitals,” said Ford. “We need to avoid lockdowns at all costs. We want our kids in schools and our businesses to stay open.” Those with medical exemptions preventing them from getting the vaccine will be allowed entry if they can present a doctor’s note, until recognized medical exemptions can be integrated as part of a digital vaccine certificate. Children who are 11 years-of-age and younger and unable to be vaccinated, will also be exempted from these requirements. From Sept. 22 - Oct. 12, people attending wedding or funeral receptions at meeting or event spaces should provide a negative rapid antigen COVID-19 test taken no more than 48 hours before the event, as an alternative to proof of vaccination. These rapid antigen tests would have to be privately purchased. Ontario will develop and provide additional tools to improve user experience, efficiency and business supports in the coming weeks, including establishing alternative tools for people with no email, health card or ID. The government will work to support implementation of vaccine certificates for Indigenous communities whether or not they have opted to enter their data into COVaxON, while maintaining Indigenous data governance, control, access and possession principles. On Oct. 22, Ontario will launch an enhanced digital vaccine receipt that will include a QR code. This receipt can be kept on a phone and used to show that you've been vaccinated when required. In addition, the province will launch a new app to make it easier and more convenient for businesses and organizations to read and verify that a digital vaccine receipt is valid, while protecting privacy. “Combining the use of a QR code with a trusted, made in Ontario verifier app will help support the province’s health measures,” said Kaleed Rasheed, associate minister of digital government. “These tools will provide a simpler, faster, and better way to prove vaccination status that is both convenient and secure – while also supporting businesses with an easy validation process.” COVaxON system to be used at Ontario schools COVaxON is an electronic vaccination management system that was installed on the IPads seen at the vaccination clinics. The system is a repository for the data related to COVID-19 immunization administration: who, what, where, when, etc., for use by select (permission enabled) Ministry of Health, vaccination locations, public health and others administering vaccine or staffing support, as required.

"2021-09-10","Full text: Belarus hockey official banned for political abuse GENEVA (AP) — The top ice hockey official in Belarus was banned for five years on Wednesday for politically motivated threats against players and supporting the country's authoritarian president. The International Ice Hockey Federation also investigated Dmitri Baskov's alleged role in an incident that led to the killing of an activist last year but could not find any evidence of “active involvement,” the governing body said. Baskov was found to have “abused his position as a representative of ice hockey in order to support the current President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko,” the IIHF said in a statement. Belarus has been in turmoil for more than a year since Lukashenko was re-elected in a vote widely seen as rigged and which led to a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests. The IIHF said Baskov was “an avid supporter” of Lukashenko, who was banned from attending future Olympic Games by the IOC after allegations that athletes who supported protests were targeted for reprisals. The former Soviet republic’s treatment of athletes was highlighted in Tokyo last month when sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya was taken to an airport by two team officials after criticizing coaches in a social media post. Tsimanouskaya refused to board a flight to Belarus fearing for her safety and was given a humanitarian visa to stay in Poland. Baskov's ban from national and world hockey includes the next two Winter Games, next February in Beijing and the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics in Italy. He was also barred from the Tokyo Olympics by the IOC because of the allegations he faced. However, Baskov shows no sign of complying with the IIHF verdict, which he can challenge in an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The Belarus Hockey Federation said Baskov would not step down and said the ruling was the result of “constantly increasing pressure of political forces on the IIHF.” It argued Baskov had merely expressed his “personal civic opinion” on issues. Evidence against Baskov was provided by the Belarusian Sports Solidarity Foundation (BSSF) and an independent investigations firm, the IIHF said. The governing body said it had investigated reports that Baskov was involved in the lethal attack of of Roman Bondarenko, a Belarusian citizen who died of his injuries after he was allegedly seized and beaten by security forces at an incident last November where police were removing red and white ribbons hung by opposition supporters. It said “although it cannot be excluded that Baskov was present at the event, it did not find evidence for an active involvement of Baskov in the attack against Bondarenka.” The IIHF said its disciplinary panel confirmed Baskov “has close personal ties to President Lukashenko as well as hockey connections with two of the president’s sons.” “The (panel) cited sufficient evidence that Baskov has tried to directly influence others to support the Belarus government and has threatened and discriminated Belarusian athletes because of their political opinion,” the governing body said. IIHF cited its rules requiring political neutrality, though long-time president René Fasel visited Lukashenko in January while trying to retain Belarus as co-host of the men's world championships this year. A backlash from tournament sponsors led the IIHF to remove Belarus and the tournament went ahead in Latvia alone. Belarus has a candidate, Sergej Gontcharov, in the five-man contest to replace Fasel at a Sept. 25 election meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia. Fasel is stepping down after 27 years. ___ AP Sports Writer James Ellingworth in Düsseldorf, Germany, contributed to this report ___ More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

Members of council, officials from Kneehill County, and Community Peace Officers will be present at the town hall meeting, and members of the community and surrounding Kneehill County are welcome to attend. The meeting was originally scheduled for Tuesday, August 31; however, due to the upcoming federal election this date has been postponed until Wednesday, November 3 at 7 p.m. “We had to temporarily stop these town hall meetings last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Drumheller RCMP Staff Sergeant Ed Bourque. S.Sgt Bourque says these meetings give department members the opportunity to interact with communities which are part of the Drumheller detachment area, and give community members an opportunity to meet the officers working in their respective areas. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, S.Sgt Bourque notes many crimes in the Drumheller detachment area declined in 2020. Many crimes have continued to remain low throughout the first quarter of 2021, between April 1 and June 30, for both rural and municipal detachment areas. Although some crimes have increased significantly between 2020 and 2021, S.Sgt Bourque notes the rates are still comparable year over year between 2017 and 2021.

"2021-09-10","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Sept. 8 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 8 ... What we are watching in Canada ... The first of two official election debates takes place tonight, with five federal party leaders facing off in what may well be their best chance to sway voters before election day on Sept. 20. With less than two weeks to go, millions of voters are expected to tune in for tonight's two-hour French debate and Thursday's English debate. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul will participate in both debates. People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier did not meet the criteria established by the independent leaders' debate commission for participation. Both debates, organized by consortiums of broadcasters, are being held at the Museum of Canadian History in Gatineau, Que., just across the river from Parliament Hill. The debates come as opinion polls suggest the Liberals and Conservatives are stuck in a tight two-way race, with the NDP and Bloc poised to determine which of the two main parties emerges victorious. Tonight's French debate begins at 8 p.m. ET. Topics to be discussed are climate change, the cost of living and public finances, Indigenous Peoples and cultural identity, justice and foreign policy, and health care and the COVID-19 pandemic. --- Also this ... The Bank of Canada will make its latest interest announcement this morning. Economists expect the central bank will keep its key interest rate target on hold at 0.25 per cent, however they will be looking to see what it has to say about the economy. The interest rate decision comes ahead of a speech by Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem on Thursday. The Bank of Canada has said it will keep its trend-setting rate at near-zero until the economy is ready to handle an increase in rates, which it doesn't expect to happen before the second half of 2022. The central bank lowered its expectations for economic growth this year in July. At the time it said it expected the economy to grow 6.0 per cent in 2021, down from its previous forecast of 6.5 per cent. However, it raised its outlook for next year to predict growth of 4.6 per cent in 2022, up from its earlier forecast of 3.7 per cent. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... NEW YORK — U.S. President Joe Biden says climate change is “everybody's crisis” after touring damage in New Jersey and New York City on Tuesday caused by flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. Biden says Ida's path of death and destruction, from Louisiana to the U.S. northeast, is turning believers out of people who once denied that climate change is real. Biden says scientists and economists have warned about climate change for years and that the situation has now reached “code red.” At least 50 deaths are being blamed on the storm in the northeast region alone. “The threat is here. It is not getting any better,” Biden said in New York. “The question is can it get worse. We can stop it from getting worse.” Biden said the threat from wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding and other extreme weather must be dealt with in ways that will lessen the devastating effects of climate change. “We can’t turn it back very much, but we can prevent it from getting worse,"" he said. Biden added that scientists have been warning for decades that this day would come and that urgent action was needed. “We don't have any more time."" --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban announced an all-male interim government for Afghanistan that is stacked with veterans of their hard-line rule from the 1990s and the 20-year battle against the U.S.-led coalition. The move seems unlikely to win the international support the new leaders desperately need to avoid an economic meltdown. Appointed as interior minister was Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is on the FBI’s most-wanted list with a US$5 million bounty on his head and is believed to still be holding at least one American hostage. He headed the feared Haqqani network that is blamed for many deadly attacks and kidnappings. The announcement came hours after Taliban fired their guns into the air to disperse protesters in Kabul and arrested several journalists. Drawn mostly from Afghanistan’s dominant Pashtun ethnic group, the cabinet's lack of representation from other ethnic groups also seems certain to hobble its support from abroad. As much as 80 per cent of Afghanistan's budget comes from the international community, and a long-running economic crisis has worsened in recent months. Near daily flights from Qatar bring in humanitarian aid, but the needs are massive, and the Taliban can hardly afford isolation. In announcing the cabinet, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid emphasized that the appointments were temporary. He did not say how long they would serve and what would be the catalyst for a change. --- On this day in 1987 ... Canadian scientists with the federal government confirmed that a large hole in the ozone layer had formed above the Arctic in the previous year. On Sept. 15, diplomats from around the world reached an agreement in Montreal on a pact to protect the ozone layer. The treaty called for industrialized countries to reduce their use of chloro-fluorocarbons by 50 per cent over a 10-year period. --- In entertainment ... TORONTO — Montreal filmmaker Denis Villeneuve says the 1965 novel that spawned the feature ""Dune"" was a seminal part of his teenage years, when he devoured European sci-fi comics, discovered cinema and dreamt of making films about worlds beyond ours. The epic interstellar story of warring families and a young antihero lingered in the back of his mind ever since, and now his vision of author Frank Herbert's tale hits the biggest of screens Saturday as a world exclusive IMAX special event at the Toronto International Film Festival. ""I like when projects have deep roots inside me, and 'Dune' has the deepest,"" Villeneuve, 53, said in a recent video interview from Montreal. ""I read this book decades ago, so it's something that, through the years, I kept being fascinated by this world, where I was feeling it was more and more relevant."" It wasn't until a few years ago that Villeneuve felt ready to take on the sweeping fantasy, which stars Timothée Chalamet as protagonist Paul Atreides, who is seen as the ""chosen one"" to save colonized planets. Rebecca Ferguson stars as his mother and Oscar Isaac plays his father, who accepts stewardship of a dangerous desert planet that holds ""spice,"" the most valuable item in the universe. ""It's not a project that I would try to do 10 years ago,"" said Villeneuve, who directed, co-produced and co-wrote the ""Dune"" screenplay with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth. ""I was ready now to do it because of the amount of technical knowledge."" That knowledge came from years of directing potent stories with moody visuals and sound — from 2010's Academy Award-nominated Canadian drama ""Incendies"" to recent Oscar-winning sci-fi spectacles ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049."" --- ICYMI ... MADRID — Health authorities in Spain are blaming human error for the switching of two baby girls in a maternity ward almost 20 years ago. The mix-up came to light after one of them discovered by chance through a DNA test as a teenager that she wasn’t the daughter of her presumed parents. The woman, now 19, who discovered she had been given to the wrong parents is demanding compensation of US$3.5 million. The other woman who was handed to the wrong parents has reportedly been informed of the mistake. Health officials said improved systems for recording births mean the same mistake couldn't happen now. “It was a human error and we haven’t been able to find out who was to blame,” Sara Alba, health chief of Spain’s northern La Rioja region, told a news conference Tuesday. “The systems back then were different and weren’t as computerized as they are now,” Alba said, offering assurances it couldn’t happen again. The newborns were mixed up in 2002 after being born five hours apart at a hospital in La Rioja. They were both in incubators because they were born underweight. Neither woman was identified. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 8, 2021 Subject: Debates; Central banks; Interest rates; Human error; Climate change; COVID-19"

"2021-09-10","Full text: GUYSBOROUGH – Guysborough-Tracadie MLA Greg Morrow has been appointed as the province’s new agriculture minister. As the newly-elected Progressive Conservative government settled into Province House, MLAs from all parties were sworn in on Aug. 30, with Premier Tim Houston’s first cabinet named and sworn in on the following day (Aug. 31). Morrow spoke to The Journal about his cabinet post on Sept. 2, just after getting a tour of his new Halifax office. Prior to his election on Aug. 17, he was a reporter and radio news director at 101.5 the Hawk in Port Hawkesbury. With a background in journalism and communications, Morrow doesn’t appear to be an obvious choice for the agriculture portfolio. But, he said, “I’m a good listener and a good communicator. If members of the industry, stakeholders, department staff, if they have issues, I have no problem listening to their concerns and bringing them to the cabinet table.” He added that, although he doesn’t have first-hand experience in agriculture, he lives, “in a rural area, so there’s lots of farms around me. Look, when the premier calls and asks you to serve in cabinet, you accept, which I did. And I’m ready to learn. I’m ready to dive in headfirst into this and get up to speed on everything going on in the department … and learning what I can do to help. “There’s a long history of cabinet ministers in this province [whose] portfolio doesn’t match their background. But I believe that if you work hard and you’re a good communicator, you’ll do just fine. We’ve seen that time and time again,” said Morrow. Morrow added that he would draw on the experience of fellow cabinet ministers, particularly John Lohr, who served as opposition agriculture critic in the previous Liberal government. When asked what challenges face agriculture in the province, Morrow said, “This is an area where I am going to rely on the stakeholders. I am going to rely on the people on the ground and the staff around me to get me up to speed on what their challenges are and be a strong voice for those challenges.” Asked to comment on the first week in government, Morrow said, “It is an exciting time. We worked hard over the past couple of months, both me personally and the party, to be in the position where I could be the MLA for Guysborough-Tracadie, and we could be the governing party of Nova Scotia; and both of those things have happened. At the request of the premier, I was asked to join cabinet and I am honoured to do so. It’s a huge thrill and a learning curve … I have no doubt in my mind that I am up for the task.” Subject: Prime ministers"

"2021-09-10","Full text: B.C. residents can now get vaccine card VICTORIA - British Columbia's premier says the province's vaccination card will keep the province's economy running after an ""unacceptable surge"" in cases, mostly among those who are unvaccinated. John Horgan said Tuesday that restaurants, theatres and sports venues have been affected by shutdowns, but the vaccine card required at non-essential businesses in B.C. starting Sept. 13 could lead more people to get fully vaccinated to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in high-risk settings. British Columbia joins Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba in introducing similar programs. Yukon announced an online vaccine credential system on Tuesday, but it will serve only as proof of vaccination for residents travelling in other jurisdictions. Horgan said that after the Sept. 20 election, he expects the federal government to take further steps to ensure that people travelling outside Canada can do so confidently with immunization data available to other countries. Those coming to Canada would also be able to prove their vaccination status, he added. ""I encourage all British Columbians to weigh against their particular point of view today, the positive benefits of following so many other British Columbians getting vaccinated to protect yourself, to protect your families and allow us all to move forward,"" he told a news conference. Horgan called on residents to unite with a ""common purpose"" and see the vaccine card as a way to resume activities like going to a movie, the theatre and enjoying large gatherings, and not to view proof of vaccination as an impediment to basic government services. ""Those who want to make this more than what it is, I really don't have much to say to them,"" he said, referring to people protesting outside hospitals last week against vaccine passports. ""I do understand that people are anxious. They're angry and they're lashing out. I regret that."" Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said residents will need to provide their personal health number, date of birth and vaccination date for either their first or second doses to securely download a vaccine card. ""As we're looking to the fall and the respiratory season that's going to be upon us again, we need to have as much open as possible,"" she said Tuesday, the same day that normal personal gatherings were expected to resume as part of the province's restart plan. However, Henry said the highly transmissible Delta variant means people who are unvaccinated are now at 12 times greater risk of infection and the risk of being hospitalized is 34 times higher compared with a vaccinated person of the same age. Proof of vaccination status at businesses will be required starting Sept. 13 for a first dose and on Oct. 24 for two doses, though Henry said people who regularly work out at a gym, for example, won't need to show their vaccine card every time because staff there would come to know that information. Once verified, a digital copy can be saved on a cellphone or a copy can be printed so either could be presented along with government-issued photo identification by those who are 19 and over when entering businesses or organized events. People without access to a computer and printer can phone a Get Vaccinated call centre and have their printed copy mailed to them or visit a Service BC centre. Henry said the card will include a secure, individualized QR code and image showing whether someone is partially or fully vaccinated or indicating that no record is found in the province's COVID-19 immunization registry. Businesses can either scan the QR code or visually verify someone's proof of vaccination. A mobile reader app is expected to be released in app stores before next week for businesses to scan the codes. Until Sept. 26, people will still be able to use the paper record provided at a clinic or pharmacy after their first or second dose of a vaccine. Over a four-day period starting on Friday, B.C. reported 2,425 new cases of COVID-19. The province said there were 5,465 active cases of COVID-19 in the province on Tuesday. — By Camille Bains in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 7, 2021.

"2021-09-10","Full text: North American stock markets mixed on Tuesday North American equity markets saw weak performances on Tuesday, as strength in the U.S. dollar and bond yields placed downward pressure on energy and gold prices. Michael Greenberg, senior vice-president and portfolio manager of Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, said financial stocks were able to benefit from the strength in U.S. bond yields, as the 10-year benchmark rose to 1.373 per cent. ""A lot of stuff is being driven today by what bond yields are doing,"" said Greenberg. ""It's driving the U.S. dollar a little bit stronger, and that correlates with energy, so you've got energy down a little bit and the Canadian dollar down a little bit ... and things like financials outperforming."" The S&P/TSX composite index was down 14.80 points at 20,806.63. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 269.09 points at 35,100.00. The S&P 500 index was down 15.40 points at 4,520.03, while the Nasdaq composite was up 10.81 points at 15,374.33. The Canadian dollar was weaker against the greenback Tuesday, with the loonie trading for 79.23 cents US compared with 79.88 cents US on Friday. The result was some weakness in commodity prices, with the December gold contract down US$35.20 at US$1,798.50 an ounce and the December copper contract down five cents at US$4.28 a pound. Oil and gas prices also took a slight hit, but Greenberg said the current environment where economies are slowly reopening has kept oil prices at a relatively consistent level. The October crude oil contract was down 94 cents at US$68.35 per barrel and the October natural gas contract was down 14 cents at US$4.57 per mmBTU. ""With COVID, it's been a bit of a two-steps-forward-one-step-back kind of environment where you get better news on vaccinations and re-openings, but as we're seeing with the Delta variant, a bit of a setback on those reopening plans,"" said Greenberg, who said there still is some upside left in oil. ""We would expect you could see a little bit more strength in oil as the year progresses."" Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies saw a significant sell-off on Tuesday following two months of strong performances from big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin fell from $66,000 to around $59,000 in less than a day, while Ethereum lost more than 11 per cent of its value in a 24 hour period. Greenberg said cryptocurrencies had been rallying on news that El Salvador would use Bitcoin as legal tender, but faltered when the implementation of the country’s app for the currency had technical issues Tuesday. ""You have to remember the volatility in cryptocurrencies is extremely high,"" said Greenberg. ""So while it may look like a really large move from an absolute perspective, you do see this kind of volatility in cryptocurrencies from time to time."" Bitcoin had nearly doubled in value from roughly $37,000 over the previous two months before the sell-off on Tuesday. Looking forward, Greenberg said analysts will be closely watching the Canadian election campaign as it draws to a close, with the vote less than two weeks away now. He said Canadians can expect more spending from a Liberal majority, the status quo from a Liberal minority, and less spending if the Conservatives form government.

"2021-09-09","Full text: New Democratic Party candidate Alex McPhee is ready for the challenge ahead in this year’s Federal Election. McPhee, a 22-year-old cartographer from Val Marie who was the first NDP candidate announced in Saskatchewan, is hoping to use his campaign to bring awareness to the value of grasslands and farmland in the prairies in the fight against climate change. “Right now, we have this Liberal carbon pricing scheme that isn't making producers feel like they're included, people in this area don’t feel like the Liberal environmental policy has anything to do with them,” stated McPhee. McPhee explained that the grasslands and range lands in the area sequester more carbon dioxide per year than the boreal forest of Canada. “If you have environmental goals that you want to achieve, you need to be looking at range land and grassland management really seriously,” he said. “There needs to be a lot of investment to look after our range lands and our pastures to achieve all of these environmental goals that all of the parties have committed to upholding, at least on paper, and that needs to be something that includes producers.” McPhee says that many producers are already trying to follow good environmental practices, but that they are covering those extra costs out of their own pockets. He says that there needs to be more federal support to help those producers. McPhee said he decided to run for the NDP this year because of current MP Jeremy Patzer’s views on the conversion therapy ban. “It's a little bit personal. I live in Val Marie with my husband. So, I have been really upset by our MP's opposition to the gay conversion therapy ban. For some reason our MP has been really interested in making that his signature issue in Parliament. I really disagree with his stance on that issue,” said McPhee. Another contributing factor in his decision to run was his interest in the roots of the NDP in Saskatchewan. “I also love the NDP history as the social conscience of Parliament and where we were the original voice of rural Saskatchewan,"" he stated. ""The Federal NDP really has it's roots as a western protest party, we have stood up for the prairies for decades and decades, while Ontario and Quebec used the House of Commons to pass laws that only benefit them, their industries and their sectoral interests,"" explained McPhee. McPhee isn’t originally from the Southwest. He grew up in the Edmonton area, but moved to Val Marie to start a business and hopes to use his campaign to promote rural Saskatchewan as a place to live for young people. “I moved back out here as soon as I graduated, because I think rural Saskatchewan is one of the best places in the country to start a business,"" he said. “What I've actually been really excited to do with my candidacy is to use my platform as an NDP candidate to promote this region to more professionals and more young people across the country, because the prairies do not get as much respect as they deserve,"" he continued. ""But I love it out here and I am here by choice.” McPhee explained that without moving to rural Saskatchewan he would not have been able to start a small business and afford rent at a four-bedroom house. “It's the legacy of the NDP that makes life more affordable out here. Because by moving to rural Saskatchewan, my car insurance rates are three times lower than what they were in Alberta. And that's all because of what the CCF did. That's because of SGI.” Currently the NDP are polling nationally in third place behind the Conservative Party who are inching ever closer to first place above the Liberals.

"2021-09-09","Full text: The new provincial PC majority government was sworn in last Tuesday, including the new Minister of African Nova Scotian Affairs, the Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives, as well as Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage — Pat Dunn. Premier Tim Houston faced questions and criticism for not appointing one of the four Black sitting MLAs from one of the other parties, or an unelected Black/African Nova Scotian to the position(s). The next day, Houston fired Dr. Késa Munroe-Anderson, the Black Deputy Minister to the departments of Communities, Culture and Heritage and African Nova Scotian Affairs, and replaced her Justin Huston, who is also white. Houston also fired Dr. OmiSoore Dryden, the first and only Black member of the Nova Scotia Health Authority’s board of directors, when he dissolved the board and replaced it with an all-white, four-person “leadership team.” This added to the frustrations of many Black Nova Scotians. Black community meetings and group sessions were organized, including one by former Black NDP candidate Colter Simmonds, with more organizing scheduled throughout the coming weeks. In response to questions about Dunn's appointment, Houston said, ""Democracy works best when the people that are elected, are put into positions of accountability and that’s the best way it works.” Though the next day, Houston was non-specific in his reasoning for replacing Munroe-Anderson with Huston, who is unelected. When asked for her thoughts on the loss of Black representation in a Nova Scotia Health leadership role in an interview with CBC News, Dryden said, in part: (link to this item) Percy Paris, the first Black MLA to hold the position of minister of African Nova Scotian Affairs, spoke to The Examiner this week about his disapproval over the appointment of a white person in his former role. Paris told the Examiner: After serving in the legislature as an opposition MP since being elected in 2006, Paris was the second MLA appointed as Minister of African Nova Scotian affairs in 2009 when the NDP was elected. PC MLA Barry Barnet was the first Minister of African Nova Scotian when the office was first launched in 2003. At the time, there were no Black MLAs serving in the legislature.

Speaking with his alma mater SMU, Kane, who once practiced law after earning a degree from Dalhousie University, said: The award, set at $30,000, is open to graduating students of African descent, with first priority given to students with roots in Nova Scotia. According to SMU, recipients of the award will receive it ""upon graduation to help mitigate the burden of financial debt; to support them in further post-secondary studies or training such as internships, apprenticeship, or self-directed projects; and to advance their aspirations for careers in writing."" Kane also spoke with African Nova Scotian CBC Radio host, Portia Clark, on Information Morning where he spoke about the award, his mother and aunt, and how his Aunt Velma gifting him with a typewriter in the seventh grade inspired him to write.

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 7, 2021 ... What we are watching in Canada ... Fully vaccinated foreign nationals are once again welcome on Canadian soil As of midnight Monday night, quarantine requirements were eased for non-essential international travellers who have had a full course of a Health Canada-approved COVID-19 vaccine -- Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot, also known as Covishield, or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson option. To be eligible, travellers must have allowed at least 14 days to pass since their last vaccine shot and show proof of a negative molecular test for COVID-19 that's no more than 72 hours old. They are also required to use the ArriveCAN app or online web portal to upload their vaccination details. Denis Vinette, vice-president of the travellers branch of the Canada Border Services Agency, says the agency will continue to conduct random tests of travellers at the border, a surveillance program that has been in place since the phased-in process of easing travel restrictions began earlier this summer. Between Aug. 9 and 26, the positivity rate for randomly selected, fully vaccinated travellers was just 0.19 per cent despite the increase in cases in both Canada and the U.S. Direct flights from India and Morocco will remain suspended until at least later this month.

MINNEAPOLIS _ The Minnesota State Patrol purged emails and text messages immediately after protests over the death of George Floyd last year, according to testimony in a lawsuit that alleges the agency targeted journalists during the unrest. During a July 28 hearing, State Patrol Maj. Joseph Dwyer testified that he and a ``vast majority of the agency'' deleted the messages after the protests and riots, according to a transcript published Friday on the court's docket. Attorneys for the Minnesota chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said the file destruction makes it nearly impossible to track the State Patrol's behaviour, as courts and investigators are trying to determine whether law enforcement used improper force against demonstrators. ""The purge was neither accidental, automated, nor routine,'' ACLU attorneys wrote in a motion asking the judge to order the State Patrol to stop attacks on journalists covering protests. ""The purge did not happen because of a file destruction or retention policy. No one reviewed the purged communications before they were deleted to determine whether the materials were relevant to this litigation.'' The lawsuit alleges the Minneapolis Police Department and the State Patrol used unnecessary and excessive force to suppress First Amendment rights to cover the unrest last summer. It's one of several lawsuits filed against law enforcement for alleged constitutional violations in use of force last summer. Jared Goyette, a freelancer who covered the unrest for the Washington Post and the Guardian, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, which says he was ""shot in the face with less-lethal ballistic ammunition'' by Minneapolis police on May 27, 2020. In addition to the lawsuit, the Department of Justice is investigating the police response to protests and riots, and Minneapolis is reviewing how its officers handled the unrest. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... BEIRUT _ A number of Syrian refugees who returned home have been subjected to detention, disappearance and torture at the hands of Syrian security forces, proving that it still isn't safe to return to any part of the country, Amnesty International said Tuesday. In a report entitled ""You're going to your death,'' the rights group documented what it said were violations committed by Syrian intelligence officers against 66 returnees, including 13 children between mid-2017 and spring 2021. Among those were five cases in which detainees had died in custody after returning to the country torn by civil war, while the fate of 17 forcibly disappeared people remains unknown. The report strongly counters claims by a number of states that parts of Syria were now safe to return to. It criticizes Denmark, Sweden and Turkey specifically for restricting protection and putting pressure on refugees from Syria to go home. It also criticizes Lebanon and Jordan, who have some of the highest number of Syrian refugees per capita. In Lebanon and Turkey, where many refugees face dire living conditions and discrimination, governments have put increasing pressure on Syrians to return. Turkey has reportedly forcibly deported many Syrians in the last two years _ expulsions that reflect rising anti-refugee sentiment in a country that once flung open its borders to millions of Syrians fleeing civil war. Denmark and Sweden earlier this year started revoking the residency permits of some Syrian refugees, arguing that the Syrian capital, Damascus, and neighbouring regions were now safe. Few experts agree with that assessment. While the security situation has stabilized in government-controlled areas and many parts of central Syria previously held by opposition rebels, forced conscription, indiscriminate detentions and forced disappearances continue to be reported. Moreover, entire neighbourhoods are destroyed, and many people have no houses to return to. Basic services such as water and electricity are poor to nonexistent. ""Any government claiming Syria is now safe is wilfully ignoring the horrific reality on the ground, leaving refugees once again fearing for their lives,'' said Marie Forestier, researcher on refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International. She said that while military hostilities may have subsided in most parts of Syria, the Syrian government's ""propensity for egregious human rights violations has not.'' The Syrian government and its chief international backer, Russia, have publicly called on refugees to return home and accused Western countries of discouraging it with claims that Syria is still unsafe. --- On this day in 1860 ... The Maple Leaf was first used as an official emblem during a visit to Toronto by the Prince of Wales. --- In entertainment ... NEW YORK _ Actor Michael K. Williams, who as the rogue robber of drug dealers Omar Little on ``The Wire'' created one of the most beloved and enduring characters in a prime era of television, died Monday. Williams was found dead Monday afternoon by family members in his Brooklyn penthouse apartment, New York City police said. He was 54. His death was being investigated as a possible drug overdose, the NYPD said. The medical examiner was investigating the cause of death. Little, a ""stick-up boy"" based on real figures from Baltimore, was probably the most popular character among the devoted fans of ``The Wire,'' the HBO show that ran from 2002 to 2008 and is re-watched constantly in streaming. Williams was also a ubiquitous character actor in other shows and films for more than two decades, creating another classic character as Chalky White in HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire'' from 2010 to 2014, and appearing in the films ``12 Years a Slave'' and ""Assassin's Creed.'' He is up for an Emmy for his role in HBO's ``Lovecraft Country.'' A win at the Sept. 19 ceremony would be his first in four nominations. --- ICYMI ...

"2021-09-08","Full text: Party leaders pledge more worker, business support OTTAWA - The three main federal party leaders marked Labour Day with promises of better working conditions and more benefits for Canadian workers, along with additional supports for businesses. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole and Jagmeet Singh of the NDP all focused their campaign efforts in vote-rich Ontario, with Trudeau saying his party would table legislation, if re-elected, to provide legal protection for businesses asking for proof of COVID-19 vaccination from staff and customers. During a campaign stop in Welland, Ont, Trudeau also promised to expand hiring and workers' support programs his government introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a tax credit for construction workers who travel or relocate for employment. ""We'll extend the Canada recovery hiring program, which makes it easier not just to hire people, but to boost wages to address the labor shortage some sectors are facing,"" he said, reiterating a pledge made last month to extend the program until March 31, 2022. Trudeau highlighted his government's record of providing a wage subsidy for businesses so they could keep workers on their payrolls during the pandemic. He also tried to position himself as a friend to the business community by touting his government's efforts to stand up for Canadian economic interests during former U.S. President Donald Trump's tenure in the White House. ""When the Americans imposed steel tariffs, we hit back, dollar for dollar. That's why Donald Trump stood down,"" Trudeau said. O’Toole, for his part, repeated an earlier pledge that his party would double the Canada Workers Benefit up to a maximum of $2,800 for individuals or $5,000 for families if elected on Sept. 20. Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, the Conservative leader said the measure would help up to 3.5 million families, noting that the increase would amount to a raise of $1 per hour for someone earning between $12,000 and $28,000 per year. ""Not only will we double the benefit, we will pay four times a year, as a direct deposit,"" he said. Currently, eligible workers can receive up to half of the credit in quarterly advance payments. O'Toole also repeated a promise that a Conservative government would double the disability supplement from $713 to $1,500, noting the increase would help families at a time when the cost of living is rising. ""If you're working hard to provide for your family, I'm going to have your back. And I want you to have more money to tackle the rising costs of living that is out of control,"" O'Toole said. Singh campaigned in the traditional party stronghold of Hamilton-Centre, where he said his party is committed to $10 universal child care, as well as a $20 minimum wage and 10 days of paid sick leave for federally regulated workers. ""We know that women were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, and so our response, coming out of this pandemic has to acknowledge those who've been hardest hit,"" he said. Singh said that while the Liberals have also made promises on a childcare program and paid sick leave, the party didn't pass these measures when they had the opportunity. None of the labour-related promises addressed issues concerning the emerging gig economy, a subject the head of the Canadian Labour Congress said should be a top priority for whoever forms government after the Sept. 20 election. Bea Bruske, speaking prior to Labour Day, said the next government needs to better protect the country's gig workers by giving them access to the social safety net and employee protections. Federal officials are currently reviewing the employment insurance system, and the place of gig workers in that system has emerged as a thorny issue. Officials are wrestling with how to calculate premiums and benefits for gig workers, as well as how to determine when someone needs aid given the sporadic nature of such jobs. Bruske said whoever forms government after the election needs to give gig workers access to the Canada Pension Plan and employment insurance system. She also said changes are needed to give gig workers the same rights as other employees under both employment standards legislation and health and safety rules. ""We believe that they need to be classified as workers and be enshrined as employees and therefore have rights and privileges like any other employee would have,"" she said. New Democrats typically have relied on unions for support at the ballot box, but the Liberals have attempted to forge close ties with labour groups since 2015, and the Conservatives are also attempting to woo workers in this campaign. Labour issues received renewed scrutiny after the recent release of new employment data for July. Government figures showed the economy added 94,000 jobs that month as public health restrictions continued to be lifted, sending the unemployment rate to its lowest level since March of this year at 7.5 per cent. But the gain still left the country 246,400 jobs, or 1.3 per cent, shy of pre-pandemic employment levels.

"2021-09-08","Full text: Councillor Tom Pickard wraps up his first term on Whitecourt Town Council next month with the hopes that he can secure victory in the race for the Mayor's chair in the October municipal election. Having grown up with a father who was a town councillor and a mother who was a school board trustee, his future in the political realm was all but a certainty. ""This is something that has been in my family's makeup, and because of that, my interest in local politics, and all politics, started when I was very young,"" said Pickard. Pickard has lived in Whitecourt for years. He married his wife, Tina, back in 1988 and briefly left the community before transferring back with the RCMP in 2001. ""I was the detachment commander here for just over four years. I then left the RCMP and worked in private enterprise for fifteen years before I retired last year,"" he said. With a degree in Economics and Political Science, Pickard joined the RCMP out of university and enjoyed a 23-year service with the department in various locations throughout Canada. Upon moving back to Whitecourt in the early 2000s, he said that getting involved with politics wasn't possible as a police officer, so he found other ways to volunteer instead. ""I worked with the snowmobile club, was president of minor hockey, vice president of the legion, and I was on the Community Services Advisory Board."" He also worked on local initiatives through his RCMP position. In 2017, Pickard was awarded the Governor General's volunteerism medal for his dedication to the community. Pickard said he waited to delve into politics until he felt ready to take on the time commitment. ""My wife and I have three children, and we were very active in their lives. By 2017, they had all left home, were educated and lived elsewhere in the province. I felt that I had the time and the experience where I could go down that municipal politics road."" Having dedication is essential as a council member, and Pickard said as a retiree, he can put more time into it than others. ""I think I'm still the only retired guy on council. There were meetings during the day, and there were times when we wanted a representative to attend, and I was available. Not everyone has that extra time, but they still fill valuable roles on various committees that they are on. Having that mix on council is important with younger, older, working, and retired members. That way, you get a different perspective, and it also allows you to have someone to attend daytime meetings when others are working."" Pickard said that working as a group of seven, dedicated and focused with one goal, was a great learning experience for him over the last four years. ""I think we've had seven very different personalities but with one goal, and that is to make things better in Whitecourt. The collective is stronger than any individual alone, and I think that Maryann's leadership was part of that. She really, really wanted everyone's opinion and worked to ensure that it was delivered. I think we had a good group."" Working through restrictions and maneuvering Zoom meetings wasn't Pickard's favourite part of the last four years. ""As an old cop, I focus on what else the person is saying other than the words they are speaking. What's their body language saying? That isn't easy in a Zoom meeting. You also lose some of that camaraderie,"" he explained. ""The good thing is that I think everyone was engaged, and it allowed the public that can't always come to a council meeting to see what kind of decisions we were making."" Looking ahead to the upcoming election, as a candidate for mayor, Pickard said he is proud of the strides made to be as transparent as possible. ""If you go on our website or to the town office, you can see the project lists, the budget reports, strategic plans, quarterly reports, and everything else down to parking studies, councillor pay and press releases. If you look up what a municipal transparency policy should look like and then look at ours, ours is textbook to what the thinktanks say a transparent municipal government should look like."" Focusing on coming out of COVID, Pickard feels that Whitecourt is poised to bounce back in a better position than other municipalities due to the planning and sound decisions made. ""I strongly, personally believe that we are in a position to rebound stronger than most communities because we did have that discipline, planning, and foresight to stay on topic and budget. We kept our taxes reasonable and kept service delivery as high as we could. We cut over a million in our last budget, which hurts when you reduce services because any budget cuts reduce services. We made some difficult choices, but I think the community is better for it, and I think we are poised to rebound."" Through conversations with other mayors and councillors from other municipalities, his thoughts on rebounding become even stronger. ""We are in a good position, and I think it's a reflection of the decisions that all seven of us have made in the last four years. I'm very proud of that."" Pickard said he and his family chose to stay in Whitecourt because there is a deep sense of community. ""When you live here, you feel it. It's a safe community. I do not deny that there is crime, but I feel safe here. It's a place to raise your kids, with a great education system, good amenities, and reasonable taxes. I think there is no other community in Alberta that delivers the level of service we do at the tax rate we have here."" Subject: Meetings; Tax rates; Mayors; Councils; Budgets"

"2021-09-08","Full text: Families, supporters march for 'two Michaels' OTTAWA - As Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor mark 1,000 days in separate Chinese prisons, their supporters took to the streets of Ottawa and beyond on Sunday to push for their freedom. Around 150 people gathered in the capital to walk roughly an-hour-and-a-half to a park near Parliament Hill. It was intended replicate the 7,000 steps Kovrig has tried to walk every day in his cramped jail cell to maintain his physical and mental well-being, along with a strict regime of reading and meditation. ""One thousand days is a long time and it wears on us, particularly our father,"" said Paul Spavor, brother to Michael Spavor, who was among the family members of the two men who led Sunday's march, holding a red banner with ""#bringthemhome"" emblazoned in white. ""We felt it important to mark this day, and Michael has come to understand the global profile of the whole situation, so he's become a little more willing to have us speak."" China's ambassador to Canada said the marchers and others are harming relations between the two countries by hyping the milestone with unwarranted accusations against his government. That left the political stalemate between Canada and China unbroken ahead of Sunday's marches, which were expected to take place throughout Canada and around the world and are shaping up to be the largest public outpourings of support for the men who have come to be known in Canada and abroad as ""the two Michaels."" Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave to an international organization, and Spavor, an entrepreneur who tried to forge ties to North Korea, were arrested in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1, 2018 as she was transiting through Vancouver airport. The Mounties were acting on an American extradition request because the U.S. wants to prosecute Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Nine days after Meng was detained, Kovrig and Spavor were arrested in China. Both have since been convicted of spying in closed Chinese courts — a process that Canada and dozens of allies say amounts to arbitrary detention on bogus charges in a closed system of justice with no accountability. China has denied that and accused Canada of being a U.S. government lapdog, and has repeatedly demanded Meng's immediate release. China says the U.S. is simply trying to prevent Huawei from asserting its dominance in the international telecommunications market. Kovrig and Spavor have languished in prison, while Meng's extradition hearing in the British Columbia Supreme Court has been unfolding at epic length, fuelled by the legal duelling between a large team of Meng's lawyers and Canadian federal Justice Department counsel acting on behalf of the U.S. The extradition hearing ended in August, and Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes is expected to render her decision sometime this fall, but it could be appealed, prolonging the imprisonment of the two Michaels. The men's relatives and supporters are pushing for some sort of political resolution that could bring them home. And they are taking to the streets to make their point. ""It's an extremely difficult milestone, but one that we want to mark in this way, in part, to honour the strength and resilience that Michael and Michael Spavor have shown,"" Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla said in an interview. ""In one of his letters, Michael had said that we don't choose our circumstances. But we do have a choice in how we handle ourselves in those circumstances. And for 1,000 days, Michael has endured this injustice and his detention with remarkable strength, dignity, and character."" Among those who joined in Sunday's march were the ambassadors to Germany, the European Union, Australia, as well as Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong and Marc Garneau, a Liberal candidate and Canada's foreign affairs minister. Garneau wouldn't offer specifics of how Canada is trying to free both men, but said the country continues to send the message they are being arbitrarily detained and should be released, and that it will keep working with the United States on the matter. ""The point is that whole process that has been going on for the last 1,000 days is actually moving in a positive direction,"" he said. ""We talk to all the people that we are dealing with and so I wouldn't say it otherwise. We are making progress, and we will continue to work until we get them free."" Spavor and Kovrig are not allowed visits from family or lawyers, except in the case of their separate trials earlier this summer at which both were convicted. Spavor was later handed an 11-year sentence, while Kovrig is still waiting. Canadian diplomats see the men roughly once a month in a video link; in-person visits ended in early 2020 and were suspended for 10 months because Chinese officials said they wanted to control the spread of COVID-19 in prisons. Kovrig was a Canadian diplomat who took a leave of absence to work for the International Crisis Group, a non-government agency. In addition to the Ottawa march, Canadian diplomats are expected to walk in solidarity in New York, Washington, Brussels and across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Spavor's family has kept a low public profile, preferring written statements to public interviews, while Nadjibulla went public last summer with her concerns and stepped up her public advocacy to push the Canadian and American governments to find a way to end the ongoing imprisonment of the two Michaels. Paul Spavor said his brother spends a lot of his time imprisoned reading, doing yoga and meditating. Cong Peiwu, China's ambassador to Canada, said in an interview the marking of the 1,000 days has ""gravely violated the norms governing international relations and international law"" and noted that Meng has been under arrest in Canada even longer. ""Recently, we have noted that a small number of people here in Canada have been hyping the so-called 1,000 days of the detention of the two Michaels, who are Canadian citizens, making unwarranted accusations against China's handling of the cases."" Cong said his government stands by a report this week from the Global Times, a newspaper controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, saying that Spavor photographed military equipment and shared the images outside the country. The report, citing unnamed sources, said Spavor shared information with Kovrig over a long period of time. Nadjibulla reiterated her long-held view that neither Kovrig nor Spavor are spies, saying the allegation that leaked out this week has been publicized in the past. Spavor's family and friends have said in written statements that he was doing nothing untoward in China and has been committed to building bridges with North Korea. Nadjibulla said the next few weeks and months will be critical towards breaking the logjam. In addition to Holmes's ruling, there will be chances for U.S. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping during the fall gatherings of the G20 and the United Nations Climate Change Conference. She said the current federal election hasn't really had any effect on the fate of the two Michaels. ""This is not a partisan issue. I have been heartened by that,"" she said. ""Canadians of all political persuasions, and all political leaders are united in the way they see this as an unjust, arbitrary detention and also in their call to bring them home."" The U.S. State Department threw its backing behind Kovrig and Spavor Sunday, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken once again calling for their release. ""The practice of arbitrarily detaining individuals to exercise leverage over foreign governments is completely unacceptable,"" Blinken said in a statement. ""People should never be used as bargaining chips."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 5, 2021. -With files from Stephanie Taylor.

"2021-09-06","Full text: Economic recovery is top of mind for Perth–Wellington incumbent John Nater as he hopes to secure a third term representing the riding. Nater, a former municipal councillor for West Perth and political science lecturer at King's University College, was first elected to federal office in 2015. ""My biggest motivating factor right now is to see our economy come back roaring,"" Nater said. ""Because there's a lot of hard working people who've faced so many challenges and I want to see those people get back on top of things."" Nater referenced the Conservatives ""job surge plan"" and ""main street tax credit program"" as two aspects of the party's platform he's particularly excited about. The former is a wage subsidy for employers that would pay up to 50 per cent of the salaries of new hires. The latter would provide a 25 per cent tax credit on amounts of up to $100,000 that Canadians personally invest in a small business over the next two years. ""So that we can see investments in small businesses that can revitalize our community, revitalize our local economy and diversify the economy as well,"" Nater said. He also wants to continue to work on improving high-speed Internet access in Perth–Wellington, something he said has been a priority for him during his time as MP. ""Especially in recent times, due to the pandemic, we've been focusing on trying to get investment in rural broadband,"" he said. Along with a focus on Internet access, Nater said he's proud of his work pushing for improvements to more traditional infrastructure in the riding as well, like roads, bridges, and water and wastewater facilities. Reflecting on his six-year term he said he's also proud of his service to the community, helping individual people with concerns ranging from tax issues to immigration problems.

"2021-09-05","Full text: A short term rental bylaw will come back to council in November, followed by a public hearing in December to hear public comments. After discussion at the Aug. 31 standing committee meeting, council decided that amending the Land Use Bylaw (LUB) to include regulations around Short Term Rentals (STRs) was not the right way to go. Coun. Albert Ostashek noted it would be confusing to weed through the LUB to make sure operators are catching all the different requirements, and that it would be easier to have a stand alone bylaw address all the requirements. Acting CAO, Laura Howarth, said administration does review if the applicant’s district complies with the LUB, and that it makes more sense for the STR to belong in the LUB with other home based businesses. A draft STR Bylaw was prepared in administration’s report, however, having a separate bylaw may get lost in the system long term, the report stated. “The challenges for the potential operators still exist in the sense that if I am a non-resident owner of a stand alone house and I’m going to rent it as a long term rental accommodation in Hinton, I don’t require a business license for that. If I make a decision to start renting it as an STR, unless I am familiar enough with the LUB to know that I need a business license to do that, there’s no particular way that I would have any knowledge that I would need to do that. Whereas if there’s a stand alone STR bylaw, it could simply refer to that and know I do need a business license in terms of less than 30 days,” Ostashek said. Howarth noted that delaying this bylaw to November is due to the upcoming municipal election and the fact that council can only vote on second and third reading if they participated in the first reading. According to administration’s report, there is an estimate of 90 STRs on the market in Hinton. Governments at all levels have been slow to provide a regulatory framework to this growing industry. There are no federal or municipal regulations specific to STRs, but provincially a Tourism Levy Bill - equivalent to a hotel tax - was introduced April 1. Administration first recommended changes to the existing LUB to treat STRs as a Home-Based Business like Bed and Breakfasts and Home Occupations that require a development permit and a business license. In this, the only difference was that a development permit would not be required if the operator does not reside at the rental premises. Lorraine Walker, Hinton’s municipal planner, explained this was a commonality amongst municipalities they researched and that the reason it wouldn’t be considered a home based business is due to the host not residing there. Nelson pointed out that the amendments to the LUB included that the STR be completely within the principal building and not contain any cooking facilities. He said this would have an impact on anybody with a kitchen in their suites, as they would not be allowed to rent it out as an STR. A suite above a garage or in a separate building would also require different applications, Walker explained. “These STRs at this time and place in this recommendation from development services, is that we will just be putting them into the residential districts where you see the home rentals already because we are not ready to go into the commercial nodes at this time,” Walker said. The Alberta Hotel and Lodging Association appeared as a delegation to council on Jan. 19, 2021 to outline the urgent need for the Town of Hinton to create a “level playing field” and to strive to create regulations that govern STRs. An STR Workshop was held between Administration and Council and administration was then directed to bring back a draft STR bylaw. The next elected council will be reviewing and giving first reading to the draft STR bylaw in November 2021. Subject: Councils; Rentals"

In 1792, Upper Canada's first legislature convened at Newark -- now Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont. In 1832, Scottish poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott died of a brain disorder at age 61. In 1844, Canada's first suspension bridge, a 74-metre span over the Ottawa River, was opened for traffic. In 1859, the Victoria Bridge at Montreal was completed. It was the first bridge over the St. Lawrence and was opened in 1860. In 1908, Thomas E. Selfridge, a 1st Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, became the first person to die in the crash of a powered aircraft, the ""Wright Flyer."" The accident, which also seriously injured pilot Orville Wright, occurred at Fort Myer, Va., just outside Washington, D.C.

In 1935, author Ken Kesey, best known for his book ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" was born in La Junta, Colo. He died on Nov. 10, 2001, following surgery for liver cancer. He's considered by some to be a link between the beat generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s. In 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland, more than two weeks after Nazi Germany launched its invasion that sparked the Second World War. Stalin and Hitler agreed to divide Poland in their non-aggression pact signed the previous month.

The government recalled the tuna two days later. Fraser later resigned. In 1987, Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford pulled his province out of negotiations between Canada and France over a boundary dispute because Ottawa was set to give away valuable fish stocks off the province's coast.

The protests were against corporate greed and financial inequality but it was unclear exactly what the demonstrators wanted. (On Nov. 15, hundreds of police in riot gear raided the park, evicting and arresting hundreds.) In 2015, General Motors agreed to pay $900 million to resolve criminal charges over its concealment of an ignition-switch defect linked to at least 169 deaths. GM also agreed to pay $575 million to settle hundreds of civil lawsuits, including the bulk of pending wrongful death and injury cases. In 2017, author Margaret Atwood's dystopian vision of ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" the deeply cynical Washington comedy ""Veep"" and the ever-topical ""Saturday Night Live"" won top series honours at an Emmy Awards ceremony that took almost non-stop aim at U.S. President Donald Trump in awards presentations and acceptance speeches. In 2018, A Toronto-area MP suddenly defected from the Liberals as the House of Commons resumed following the summer break. Leona Alleslev said she switched to the Opposition Conservatives because Canada needs strong leadership on the economy and global issues.

Dave and his wife Charlene reside in Leamington and are proud parents of four grown daughters. According to Epp, Canada’s Conservatives will introduce the Canada Job Surge Plan to get Canadians back to work once the Canada Emergency Way Subsidy ends. “An O’Toole government will pay at least 25 percent of the salary of net new hires for six months after CEWS expires,” said Epps Epp believes that under the current government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the economy is experiencing high unemployment. “As the pandemic wanes and the recovery begins, Conservatives will incentivize people getting back to work instead of paying people to stay home,” said Epp. The Conservative Party of Canada candidate said his government would extend CEBA-like loans capped at $200K, with up to 25 percent forgivable. He added they would also provide a “Rebuild Main Street” Tax Credit, which will be a 25 percent tax credit for those investing up to $100,000 into small businesses on Main Streets. “Canada’s Conservatives got us out of the last recession.

Hetherington is also an advocate for health care and has spent over 20 years on the Chatham-Kent Health Alliance Foundation Board as well as 10 years with the Children’s Treatment Centre Board, helping to raise millions of dollars for both organizations. When it comes to local issues, Hetherington said giving financial support during the tough times caused by Covid-19 was paramount. He claims the Liberal plan was fast and effective. “We had to make money available quickly for families and businesses or we could have faced a serious market collapse. Our 75 percent wage subsidy for businesses assisted many companies and small businesses, and the 60,000 dollars in partially forgivable loans assisted many also.” According to Hetherington, going forward, the government needs to remove the stimulus and get people back to work. He added the government needs to do more to help families with childcare. Many of our families can’t get ahead paying hundreds of dollars for childcare,” said Hetherington. “Our plan of 10 dollar childcare will help families leave the financial support and see that they can now get ahead and get back to work.” Location: Canada"

"2021-09-05","Full text: Chamber to leaders: Let's talk critical minerals WASHINGTON - The relentless march of climate change, a burgeoning tech sector and the ongoing federal election campaign make now the perfect time to explore how to make Canada a world power in the production of critical minerals, the country's business leaders say. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is urging the parties vying to form the next government to spell out their strategies for making critical minerals and rare-earth elements a fundamental part of North America's economic recovery. It says Canada is missing a ""major opportunity"" to be a global leader in producing the metals that power everything from cellphones to electric cars — minerals it says must be at the centre of any serious effort to develop a low-carbon economy and confront climate change. ""The importance of strengthening trusted and sustainable critical mineral supply chains and reducing our dependence on China is growing for both Canada and the United States,"" the chamber says in a release. ""Canada urgently needs a trade and economic strategy for our own critical mineral deposits. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail."" The chamber wants to see detailed plans for encouraging and expanding domestic production, fortifying vulnerable supply chains and partnering with the U.S., where President Joe Biden's climate ambitions rest on jump-starting an already red-hot electric-vehicle market. Canada is already a key source of 13 of the 35 minerals that the U.S. has identified as critical to its economic and national security — it is America's largest single supplier of potash, indium, aluminum and tellurium, and the second-largest source of niobium, tungsten and magnesium. China is the world's largest rare-earth producer, with more than 60 per cent of global annual production, well ahead of the U.S., Myanmar, Australia and India. Canada, meanwhile, is home to an estimated 15 million untapped tonnes of rare-earth oxides. It's a political issue because there's not yet enough private-sector demand to stimulate the growth of a nascent rare-earth industry without government incentives, said Mark Agnew, the chamber's senior vice-president of policy and government relations. ""The thing that we hear is that there needs to be that kind of downstream demand to create the financial incentives for it to be extracted upstream,"" Agnew said. ""That's why what we are talking about is, 'OK, how do you generate demand?"" In their campaign platform, Justin Trudeau's Liberals promise to use ""the minerals at our fingertips"" to build batteries for zero-emissions vehicles and ""position Canada as a world leader in this space,"" although there are few specifics beyond a vague pledge to ""attract investment."" The federal Liberal government's 2021 budget included plans for an $8-billion ""net zero accelerator"" to subsidize clean-technology investments in the manufacturing and natural resources sector, and to help expand the development and production of electric vehicles. ""What we really want to show to the world and show to companies and potential investors is that if you invest in Canada, you really can have that whole supply chain,"" said Liberal spokesman Alex Deslongchamps. ""Wherever you are in that supply chain, whether you're the manufacturer, the producer, or the actual mining companies, the next person in that chain is right there domestically, and is integrated."" The Conservative election platform proffers a five-year, $5-billion innovation fund, part of which it would put toward stimulating EV development, including battery technology, if Erin O'Toole were to be elected prime minister. And if Jagmeet Singh were elected, the NDP says it would use incentives to encourage families to buy ""made-in-Canada"" zero-emissions vehicles, build more charging stations and establish a research centre to spur new advances in hydrogen, batteries and energy storage. In addition to extracting minerals in a sustainable way, with the full blessing of Indigenous communities, Singh said, Canada must also do the value-added work — refining, processing and manufacturing — at home as well. ""We need to make sure we're manufacturing the goods of the future, which is renewable energy, which is electrified transportation,"" he said. ""There's a lot that we can do and we've got a plan to make sure we achieve it."" In 2019, the U.S. State Department and Bureau of Energy Resources established a multilateral initiative aimed at ensuring reliable supply chains for critical minerals. Canada signed on and established a so-called joint action plan with the U.S. early in 2020. Officials from both countries met virtually in June last year as part of a critical minerals working group to advance discussions on that plan — efforts Ottawa billed as evidence that it was serious about attracting investment to make the metals a central component of Canada's natural resources industry. In February of this year, meetings between Trudeau and President Joe Biden produced a ""road map"" for a renewed bilateral relationship that included vows to make Canada and the U.S. ""global leaders in all aspects of battery development and production."" Since then, however, the American commitment to that plan has come into question, particularly given Biden's strident rhetoric about his protectionist ""Buy American"" doctrine and the apparent disconnect over non-essential travel across the Canada-U.S. border. Canadians are largely prohibited from crossing the land border for discretionary purposes until at least Sept. 21, even though fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents have been allowed to travel north for nearly a month. And Biden has promised a strict cap on exemptions to Buy American, rhetoric that worries Canadian suppliers and contractors who fear a chilling effect on their ability to do business with state and local governments south of the border. ""There are plenty of reasons for Canada to be deeply frustrated,"" said Eric Miller, a Canada-U.S. expert and president of the D.C.-based Rideau Potomac Strategy Group. ""They're finding out that the United States is a country which is evolving, which has got many domestic challenges … and you've got a president in Joe Biden who's happy to work with you on what he wants to work on, but he's not much interested in what you want to work on.""

Only four leaders -- the Liberals' Justin Trudeau, the Conservatives' Erin O'Toole, the Bloc Quebecois' Yves-Francois Blanchet and the NDP's Jagmeet Singh -- will take part. The Green party's Annamie Paul and the Peoples' party's Maxime Bernier were not invited to participate. The TVA debate was seen as pivotal in the 2019 campaign. Then-Conservative leader Andrew Scheer's evasiveness on the issues of abortion and medical assistance in dying was widely seen as halting early Conservative momentum, ultimately enabling Trudeau's Liberals to eke out a minority win. The performance of Blanchet, a newcomer to federal politics at the time, was also credited with giving new life to the Bloc Quebecois, which helped rob Trudeau of a second majority mandate. Blanchet and O'Toole had no public events in the hours leading up to their debate, which will also be a first for O'Toole as Conservative leader. Trudeau hit Montreal's Saint Laurent Boulevard around lunchtime, stopping to chat and pose for countless photos with students in frosh week shirts, shop owners and young families with babies in tow. He stopped at one point to buy smoked meat sandwiches for his team and latkes for himself. Singh handed out samples of his personal recipe for ``Punjabi poutine'' from a custom truck that almost didn't make it after a wheel fell off -- something the New Democrats hope doesn't happen to their campaign in Quebec. The province in 2011 helped make the N-D-P the Official Opposition, but in 2019 they lost all but one seat there. Singh told reporters that his strategy going into the debate was to target Trudeau and the Liberal government's policies and paint a stark choice for voters. --- Subject: Prime ministers"

"2021-09-05","Full text: There have always been gaps in Canadian society, but COVID-19 has only “exacerbated” problems that already existed. So says Yvonne Kelly, who will carry the New Democratic Party of Canada banner in Newmarket-Aurora for the Federal election set for September 20. Now in her third campaign to turn Aurora’s north riding orange for the first time, Ms. Kelly says it is time for voters to think seriously about the NDP as a viable alternative to Liberal and Conservative governments. “If you look at Provincial governments right across the country, the NDP have the best track record for fiscal responsibility while also achieving the broad social goals and programs they set out to do,” says Ms. Kelly. “Have we led federally? No, but we have certainly been in minority positions where we have been able to get amazing things happening.” The global pandemic is a prime example, she says, pointing to the efforts of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh on CERB and EI to help Canadians stay afloat during unprecedented uncertainty. “We have very distinct ideas about how to solve [problems],” she says. When Ms. Kelly first became involved in local politics even before securing her party’s nomination locally, she was a campaign leader driven to “build community and build a progressive moment” with other people. In the last three or four years, momentum has built in the area of social equity, diversity and inclusion. As she goes door-to-door, Ms. Kelly says residents are saying “we want to do more.” “The issues of the NDP are the issues I stand for,” says Ms. Kelly, who grew up in Saskatchewan, the home province of party-founder Tommy Douglas. “I feel, as a society, we are only going to advance together if we take care of those who are left behind at times, who are left out of opportunities, who don’t have the same capacity to earn income as those who are able to make the most of whatever financial gains they either came into the world with or have been able to accrue. We can’t leave people behind. There is just something fundamentally wrong about that idea.” A key area where she says many people have been left behind is the issue of affordability. 10 years ago, it would have been hard to believe that in Aurora and Newmarket there would come a day when they “might not be able to afford a home or not be able to afford rent.” “That has ramped up in a way nobody saw coming,” she says. “It is a global problem, but if we don’t deal with it in our own back yard, we’re never going to get ahead of it.” Housing was a top-of-mind priority for her in the last Federal campaign in 2019 and it remains so today, along with affordable child care, implementing a pharmacare program and, of course, improving the environment. “We’re the only country that has a universal health care system that doesn’t have a universal drug or pharmacare plan,” she says. “[Our Federal] governments have known forever that they need to go toe-to-toe with the big pharmaceutical companies and purchase nationally so that we can pass along those savings to those who need them because when your housing is out of reach, when you can’t count on the type of work that is going to give you health benefits and a decent, adequate income, one of the first places, aside from cutting back on food, you’re going to cut back on your prescription drugs. Everyone is dealing with the cost and we pay the third highest amount on prescription drugs as anywhere in the world. “If you talk to folks who are fighting for the environment, they will tell you that nothing else matters as much. On the one hand, they’re very right because we only have a certain number of years to be able to address this. It is hard to tell someone who can’t put food on the table that the environment is the most important issue, so I don’t get into the game of ranking them, but getting our carbon emissions down, getting net zero by 2050, is the goal we have set right now and we would like to see that happen sooner. The only way you can do that is by standing up to big polluters, not providing loopholes, stop investing in fossil fuels and oil companies, and start investing in green infrastructure.” Doing so will be a shot in the arm for good jobs as well and keep Canadians “on the right side of history.” History also needs to be addressed and that is why Ms. Kelly says as a Member of Parliament she will be an advocate for the Indigenous community and Truth & Reconciliation. It is, she says, “kind of like a ball that gets passed around” from government to government and that needs to stop. “We know our communities are going through a lot, they are going through trauma and they are being re-traumatized,” she says, referencing the re-discovery of the remains of thousands of children in areas associated with residential schools. “We need to support people, we need to stop taking people to court, and we need to make sure we make good on the promise of clean water. We’re not talking about complicated things; if Newmarket and Aurora ran out of clean drinking water, you can be damn sure there would be hell on the street and people stomping on the doors of Council and things would be turned around very quickly. “It is about making people’s lives better in all counts.” Subject: Pharmaceutical industry; COVID-19"

"2021-09-05","Full text: One person has died and four more residents of Kamloops Seniors Village (KSV) in have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the number of positive cases at the Aberdeen long-term care home to nine. Interior Health declared an outbreak on the 1C and 1B complex-care neighbourhoods on Aug. 27, but cases began showing up a week earlier amongst staff. An update from Interior Health on Sept. 1 lists the KSV cases as remaining at five, with one death connected to the outbreak. An online update from KSV staff, however, indicates nine total cases as of Sept. 1 — three more 1C residents and one more from 1B were found to be positive for COVID-19. The new cases followed nasal tests on Aug. 30 of the remaining 36 residents in between the two units who hadn’t already tested positive. The release, however, does not mention the death. All four of the people who tested positive on Aug. 30 were asymptomatic at the time of testing, a KSV press release stated. The 1B resident who tested positive was temporarily moved to 1C until further notice and all 1B residents are now isolated in their respective suites — having previously only being confined to the 1B unit when the outbreak was declared. Residents of 1C are also confined to their rooms and visitation and group activities remain cancelled for the two neighbourhoods. As of Sept. 1, four residents of 1C are currently showing symptoms of COVID-19, but are resting in their rooms and not showing any “clinical concerns” the KSV updates read. On Aug. 19 and Aug. 20, KVS learned two staff members from 1C — one of whom was fully vaccinated — tested positive for COVID-19. On Aug. 25, three residents — two from 1C and one from 1B — tested positive for COVID-19 after Interior Health recommended testing all 1C residents and two unvaccinated residents of 1B. The health authority determined the two initial staff cases were unrelated to each other, so an outbreak was not initially declared and the facility remained in a ""heightened precaution"" mode until after a review following the first three resident cases being found. The outbreak declaration of Aug. 27 does not affect the other four complex-care units or the independent and assisted living side of the building, according to KSV. Visitation and group recreation activities will continue for the unaffected units, with standard safety protocols in place. All residents, however, continue to be monitored for symptoms, but are only tested if they show signs of the virus. Asymptomatic rapid testing of KSV staff who worked on the 1C and 1B neighbourhoods dating back to Aug. 3 continues to be conducted and, as of Sept. 1, none have shown symptoms, according to the care home’s latest update. Staff from 1C have been confined to that cohort. The outbreak in the two units will remain in place until 28 days have passed from the last detected case of COVID-19. KSV has a call with Interior Health and a medical health officer scheduled for Sept. 2 to review the situation. Kamloops Seniors Village offers three levels of care in its Hugh Allan Drive facility, with 114 complex-care studio suites within six neighbourhoods on the west end of the building. Three are located on the first floor (1A, 1B, and1C), and three are located on the second floor (2A, 2B, and 2C). On the building’s east side, KSV has 101 assisted-independent living apartments. KTW is awaiting a call back from KSV regarding the death. Despite the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, Kamloops Seniors Village is still hosting an advance polling station on Sept. 13 for the Sept. 20 federal election. But due to the outbreak, long-term care residents of the Aberdeen facility will not be allowed to participate. A mail-in ballot is still an option and KSV is advising families to go online and request a vote by mail package no later than Sept. 14 at 6 p.m. The package is to be addressed to each resident’s Kamloops Seniors Village address. The recreation team will facilitate their vote and mail the package on the residents’ behalf. An internal Interior Health memo obtained by KTW on Aug. 27 noted there are potential COVID-19 exposure events at three long-term care homes in Kamloops, none of which had as of then resulted in a declaration of an outbreak. The memo did not specify locations. None Subject: Long term health care; Asymptomatic; Coronaviruses; Neighborhoods; COVID-19"

"2021-09-04","Full text: N.B. chiefs upset after seizure of fishing boat FREDERICTON - Indigenous chiefs in New Brunswick say the federal Fisheries Department is preventing members of the St. Mary's First Nation from feeding their families, after officers last week seized a lobster fishing boat operating in the Bay of Fundy. Canada is ignoring Indigenous rights to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes and to a livelihood fishery, the six chiefs of the Wolastoqey Nation said Wednesday in a news release. ""St. Mary's First Nation members are being prevented from feeding their families by DFO (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) enforcement, and at the same time DFO seems intent on escalating the situation,"" the chiefs wrote. ""This is creating dangerous conditions for everyone on the water."" The chiefs said federal officers seized a 20-foot-long lobster fishing boat in the Bay of Fundy operated by members of St. Mary's First Nation in Fredericton. ""The chiefs of the Wolastoqey Nation in New Brunswick are calling on representatives of DFO to take immediate steps to ensure that the basic needs of First Nations members can be met in accordance with the Aboriginal rights of the Wolastoqiyik and the Peace and Friendship Treaties, which have been in place since before the Confederation of Canada,"" they wrote. St. Mary's Chief Allan Polchies says his members have been fishing for lobster in the Bay of Fundy since late July and have been harassed by fisheries officers. ""They haven't released the boat yet,"" Polchies said in an interview Wednesday. ""Because of the (federal) election right now they are trying to use every tactic they can to buy time to keep the Indigenous Wolastoqey people from fishing."" In an emailed statement, Fisheries and Oceans Canada confirmed the seizure of the boat and said two people were arrested for alleged violations under the Fisheries Act. The department said that part of the bay, known as area 36, is open for fishing from the second Tuesday in November to Jan. 14 and from March 31 to July 9. ""Any fishing taking place without a licence or in contravention of a licence issued by the department is considered unauthorized, and is subject to enforcement action. As this matter is part of an ongoing investigation, no further comment will be provided,"" spokesperson Heidi MacDonald said. St. Mary’s First Nation, she added, was issued a 2021 Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licence by the department, which she said authorizes communal harvesting for food, social and ceremonial purposes, including for lobster in area 36. But Polchies said it's not enough to feed his community. ""We are asking DFO to give us more fishery tags to allow us to do that and buy us some time until we put our management plan together,"" he said. ""Right now, for a population of 2,000 members, I have 20 tags. I couldn't feed my whole community on what DFO is giving us."" Polchies would not say what his community's next steps would be, but he said he expected the situation to escalate. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 2, 2021.

"2021-09-04","Full text: Chinese-Canadian frontline workers are largely employed in low-wage and high-risk sectors and work long hours, which increases their vulnerability to health risks due to the pandemic and socio-economic exploitation and marginalization, a new report has found. The Chinese Canadian National Council Toronto Chapter (CCNCTO) released the 53-page report on Sept. 1 as a way to reflect “demands for more progressive and robust policy changes that prioritize increasing resources and protections for workers.” Its findings are based on 295 survey results from workers and community members as well as 11 in-depth community-led interviews that ran from January to March of this year. “Asian Canadians face the parallel pandemic of confronting the virus of COVID-19 and the virus of racism,” Kennes Lin, CCNCTO’s co-chair, said in a virtual press conference. “We have seen a disturbing skyrocket increase in the number of hate crimes, racist attacks, stigmatization and acts of discrimination on Chinese Canadians and Asian Canadians.” The organization is working with other Asian-Canadian groups to make anti-Asian racism an election issue. She said the report is intended to document and highlight the “systemic and structural level of covert racism that is experienced by many marginalized Chinese Canadian low-wage essential frontline workers.” According to the report, “(f)actors such as immigration status, gender, age, low wages, unsafe work conditions, and lack of access to health care and income support impacted frontline workers in a myriad of ways and increased their vulnerability to health risks and socio-economic marginalization.” Most of the workers surveyed were employed as personal support workers, in restaurants, grocery stores and factories. Among the findings are that 80.4 per cent of frontline workers surveyed reported not receiving a pandemic pay increase; 75.6 per cent reported loss of income during the pandemic; and 54.5 per cent said their wages are too low. It also found that 69.4 per cent of frontline workers are not unionized, and 70 per cent felt powerless to improve their working conditions. The report made four policy recommendations for all political parties: During the conference, an undocumented grocery store worker identified only as “Mr. Xie” to protect his identity shared his story of how hard it has been for him to work during COVID while sustaining an onslaught of racism from the general public, exploitative working conditions from his employer and lack of governmental assistance. For instance, he says, unlike some of his colleagues who have full immigration status and access to government pandemic emergency resources, which allows them to stay at home, he’s had “no choice” but to continue commuting four hours daily to work 12-hour shifts, six days a week. “I still have to send money back to China to raise my minor children, so I have no other choice but to continue working,” he said in Mandarin with the assistance of an English translator. He said even as he “saw the increasing number of people in Canada who (were) hit by COVID-19,” as an essential worker, he felt forced to commute to work in a crowded bus. “I was in close contact with customers at work. I was scared to death,” he said. Mr. Xie said due to his undocumented status, he had been unable to obtain an Ontario OHIP health card since arriving in 2015. It was only with the help of the CCNCTO and a legal aid clinic that he was able to do so last year. On March 1, 2020, after he got a much-needed medical checkup with his newly obtained OHIP card, he was found anemic. It was only “after four days of blood transfusion,” he said, that his condition improved. Against the doctor’s orders, which were to rest for at least a week after being discharged from the hospital, Mr. Xie “secretly” went to work the next day. “I felt especially helpless during the pandemic because of my lack of immigration status. I was afraid of anti-Asian racist attacks, as well as COVID-19,” he said. “Even when I was seriously ill, I didn’t dare to take time off work for fear that my boss will find someone to replace me.” Mr. Xie had his second blood transfusion this past August 24. Though the report focuses on the Chinese Canadian community, its findings echo the realities that many other racialized essential workers face. Latinos, for instance, are seven times more likely to contract COVID than others, the CBC reported earlier this year, due to higher stress from racism and discrimination, pre-existing health disparities linked to social and economic factors and other challenges accessing health care and social services. Statistics Canada also found that between March 2020 and February 2021, women accounted for 53.7 per cent of jobs lost during the pandemic, with racialized women – most of whom are frontline essential workers – particularly hit, NCM reported. And in June of this year, findings from a survey of 5,000 racialized and non-racialized individuals revealed that “at least 80 per cent of respondents said racism is a problem where they live,” according to an NCM report. According to Deena Ladd, the executive director at the Workers Action Centre (WAC), “powerful stories” like Mr. Xie’s are reflective of “what workers have gone through on a daily basis” during the pandemic. “Many workers have phoned (WAC) as their employees have threatened to fire them when they’ve tried to take a day off because they’ve got to take care of their children, or because they’re not feeling well,” she said at the press conference. “Many workers have had absolutely zero access to COVID emergency support benefits because of precarious immigration status.” For many, she emphasized, precarious immigration status is the main factor behind the exploitation they endure. “How are you supposed to speak up and deal with those kinds of realities at work if you’re threatened with deportation?” Ladd said. Lin says CCNCTO, in collaboration with other Asian Canadian organizations, sent a letter to all parties on August 17 regarding their stance on Anti-Asian racism. She said they are still “waiting for a response.” For her part, Ladd said of all four parties, only the Liberals and the NDP have plans involving 10 permanent paid sick days for all federally regulated workers. The NDP has also committed to an adequate floor of employment insurance rates of $500, “which is great,” she said. The Liberals are “starting to get there.” In sharp contrast, she added, the Conservatives have a plan she described as “the most dangerous,” as it creates a “special fund for gig workers” that would make them ineligible for employment insurance. There have been no “great policy discussions” around status for all. “We really just need a real robust labour strategy, because…if you have strong labour rights in the workplace, that means that you have a strong public health strategy, and the two are in combination with important immigration law changes that would actually provide real protection,” Ladd said. Lin said the pandemic has made the lines between racialized workers and their non-racialized counterparts clearer, with some frontline workers deemed “heroes (while) leaving other frontline essential workers invisible.” “Many Chinese Canadians have faced the brunt of systemic and interpersonal racism during this pandemic, in grocery stores, restaurants, massage work, sex industry, and the health sector.” This has to be situated within a “long history of systemic anti-Asian racism in Canada,” she said, which includes the Chinese Head Tax; the Chinese Exclusion Act; the Komagata Maru incident in which a group of people from British India attempted to immigrate to Canada in April 1914 but were denied entry and forced to return to Calcutta; and Japanese internment camps. “We must also contextualize interpersonal and systemic anti-Asian violence with the histories and ongoing erasure, marginalization and exclusion experienced by Indigenous, Black, Muslim and people of colour communities,” she added. “That despite our struggles feeling different, these struggles are intertwined and connected to the violence of white supremacy.” Subject: Immigration policy; Blood transfusions; Health risks; Racism; Chinese Canadians; Essential workers; Employment; Pandemics; Working conditions; Health risk assessment; Press conferences; Canadians; Social exclusion; Community; Coronaviruses; Asian Canadians; Wages & salaries; COVID-19; Grocery stores"
"2021-09-04","Full text: N.S. COVID reopening target 'very firm': premier HALIFAX - Nova Scotia's premier said Thursday he's not budging from the government's target of getting 75 per cent of all residents vaccinated against COVID-19 before the province enters its final phase of reopening. The target is ""very firm,"" Tim Houston told reporters following his first cabinet meeting since the Progressive Conservatives won a majority in the Aug. 17 election. The government has said it would enter Phase 5 of the province's reopening plan on Sept. 15 if the vaccination goal is met. ""The 75 per cent is the hurdle that puts us into Phase 5,"" Houston said. ""If that's not met, we don't start Phase 5 until it is."" If the target is reached, then the government will lift COVID-19 restrictions across the province, including masking, physical distancing and limits on gatherings. As of Thursday, about 71 per cent of all Nova Scotians were fully vaccinated and 78 per cent had received at least one dose of vaccine. Houston encouraged people to get their shots, with slightly less than two weeks to go until the province can potentially lift all pandemic-related restrictions. ""I hope people get out as soon as possible — vaccination is the key,"" he said. Meanwhile, students are set to return to classes on Tuesday. Under the province's back-to-school plan, they will be required to wear masks inside school buildings or buses at all times except for limited circumstances, such as eating. But under Phase 5 of the reopening plan, schools will be allowed to transition to optional mask use. Education Minister Becky Druhan offered reassurances Thursday, saying she recognized some parents are anxious about the potential lifting of the mask mandate. ""We are very confident in the plan that we currently have in place and we will continue to adjust and adapt as needed as epidemiology changes,"" Druhan said. The minister also said all schools are being inspected for safety ahead of next week's reopening — including their ventilation systems. Health officials reported five new cases of COVID-19 Thursday and 60 active infections across the province. Three new cases were identified in the Halifax area and officials said two of those had been linked to a known source while the third was under investigation. The remaining cases included one in the western zone that was under investigation and one in the northern zone that was related to travel. Officials said no one in the province was hospitalized with the disease. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 2, 2021.

The company has stopped short of requiring in-store employees to be vaccinated, but does not rule out doing so in the future.

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 2 ... What we are watching in Canada ... The first televised debate of the federal election campaign takes place tonight. Only four leaders — the Liberals' Justin Trudeau, the Conservatives' Erin O'Toole, the Bloc Québécois' Yves-Francois Blanchet and the NDP's Jagmeet Singh will face off. The Green party's Annamie Paul and the Peoples' party's Maxime Bernier were not invited to participate. The French debate on TVA, one of Quebec's most-watched networks, comes at the mid-point of the campaign and could prove crucial to the outcome on Sept. 20. The TVA debate is in addition to two official debates organized by the Leaders' Debates Commission. The official debates are scheduled to take place next week — in French on Sept. 8 and in English on Sept. 9. Paul will participate in those debates, but Bernier, who didn't meet the independent commission's criteria for participation, will not. --- Also this ... The Canadian Chamber of Commerce wants federal leaders to get serious about making critical minerals a fundamental part of North America's economic recovery. The chamber says Canada is missing a ""major opportunity"" to be a world power in producing the minerals and rare-earth elements that power everything from cellphones to electric cars. It says critical minerals must also be at the core of any successful strategy to transition to a low-carbon economy and mitigate the impact of climate change. But so far, Canada's federal election campaign has been devoid of any serious discussion about capitalizing on the country's rich reserves of critical minerals and rare-earth metals. The chamber wants to see detailed plans for expanding domestic production, fortifying supply chains and partnering with the United States, where demand is already soaring. China is the world's largest rare-earth producer, with more than 60 per cent of global annual production, well ahead of the U.S., Myanmar, Australia and India. Canada, meanwhile, is home to an estimated 15 million untapped tonnes of rare-earth oxides. ""Canada urgently needs a trade and economic strategy for our own critical mineral deposits,"" the chamber warns in a statement. ""Failing to prepare is preparing to fail."" --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... A federal bankruptcy judge has approved with conditions a historic opioid settlement between Purdue Pharma and thousands of local and state governments in the United States. Under the settlement, the OxyContin maker will be reorganized into a new company that will funnel its profits into efforts to fight the overdose crisis. Members of the Sackler family will give up ownership of the company and pay $4.5 billion, but they also will be freed from any future civil liability involving opioids. It also sets up a compensation fund that will pay some victims of drug addiction an expected $3,500 to $48,000 each. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said he would approve the plan as long as two technical changes were made. If so, he said, he will formally enter the decision on Thursday. The settlement comes nearly two years after the company based in Stamford, Conn., filed for bankruptcy under the weight of some 3,000 lawsuits from states, local governments, hospitals, unions and others. They accuse Purdue Pharma of fuelling the crisis by aggressively pushing sales of its best-selling prescription painkiller. Richard Sackler, a former Purdue president and board chairman, said under questioning that he, his family and the company did not bear responsibility for the opioid crisis. Drain noted that none of the four Sacklers who testified offered an explicit apology. “A forced apology is not really an apology, so we will have to live without one,” he said. Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and the three largest U.S. drug distribution companies recently announced a settlement that could be worth up to $26 billion if state and local governments agree. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... KABUL, Afghanistan — An official says the United Nations’ stockpiles of food could run out this month in Afghanistan, which threatens to add a hunger crisis to the challenges facing the country’s new Taliban rulers. Ramiz Alakbarov, the UN‘s humanitarian chief in Afghanistan, said about one third of the country’s population of 38 million doesn’t know if they will have a meal every day. The UN’s World Food Program has brought in food and distributed it to tens of thousands of people in recent weeks, but with winter approaching and a drought ongoing, more money is needed. Earlier, UN officials said that of the US$1.3 billion needed for overall aid efforts, only 39 per cent has been received. Afghanistan relies heavily on international aid and is in the midst of a worsening economic crisis. In addition to the concerns about food supplies, civil servants haven’t been paid in months and the local currency is losing value. Most of Afghanistan’s foreign reserves are held abroad and currently frozen. Khalid Payenda, Afghanistan's former acting finance minister, on Wednesday detailed a country existing in a dangerously fragile state. Speaking at Georgetown University in Washington, Payenda said the Afghan currency had yet to crash because money exchanges had been shuttered. But its value could plunge by more than 100 per cent, said Payenda, who described former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani as withdrawn and paranoid ahead of the Taliban takeover. “I think the war had a toll on his psyche and he saw everything with suspicion,” Payenda said. Part of the chaos reflects the speed at which the Taliban took control of the country, with Payenda saying he thought the prior government could have been sustained for two or three more years because of commitments by international donors. “I did not expect it to be this quickly,” Payenda said. “Nobody actually did.” --- On this day in 1912 ... The first Calgary Stampede began. It was instigated by Guy Weadick, an American trick roper who thought Calgary would be a prime location for a big rodeo.

VENICE, Italy — Hope for the future of cinema was front of mind for many as the Venice International Film Festival kicked off Wednesday on the Lido. The 78th edition of the oldest festival in the world has returned with precautions amid the pandemic to celebrate the best of what’s to come in film. There are both newcomers and established veterans like Jane Campion and Pedro Almodóvar. Jury president Bong Joon Ho said Wednesday in the opening news conference that COVID-19 will pass and cinema will continue. “I have the feeling and impression that everyone is willing to come back, ready to start again, ready to release the films that stayed on the shelf for two years,” festival director Alberto Barbera told The Associated Press. “And the hope is that the audience will come back to the theatres, which is the best way to watch a movie.” Although a vocal supporter of the movie theatre experience, Barbera also sees the good in streaming and again is hosting several Netflix films at the festival, including Campion's “The Power of the Dog.” “We all know that after the reopening the situation will be completely different from the past. (Streaming) platforms are there to stay, cinema, theatres will not disappear,"" Barbera said. “But we will face sort of a double system ... theatres and platforms."" Bong Joon Ho, the Oscar-winning director of “Parasite” who is presiding over the main jury year, said that the last year “was a test that showed the life force of cinema.” “Filmmakers had a very tough time last year,” Bong told a news conference. “I don’t believe that the history of cinema can be stopped so easily. So COVID will pass and cinema will continue.” --- ICYMI ... LONDON — Britain’s media regulator has cleared TV personality and journalist Piers Morgan of any violations for making comments about Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, that drew more than 50,000 viewer complaints. The Office of Communications, known as Ofcom, says Morgan didn't breach the broadcasting code when he said on “Good Morning Britain” that he didn't believe what Meghan said during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. During the March interview, the duchess said she had suicidal thoughts while struggling to fit in with the monarchy. “This is a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for Princess Pinocchios. Do I get my job back?” Morgan, 56, tweeted in response to the decision. Meghan, who before she married Prince Harry in May 2018 was an American actress known as Meghan Markle, told Winfrey that royal officials ignored her concerns about her mental health and that she faced racist attitudes. Ofcom said that while Morgan’s comments were “potentially harmful and offensive to viewers,” regulators “took full account of freedom of expression.” “Under our rules, broadcasters can include controversial opinions as part of legitimate debate in the public interest,” the office said in a statement. “The restriction of such views would, in our view, be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 2, 2021 Subject: Strategic materials; Bankruptcy; Minerals; Food; American dollar; Debates; Chambers of commerce; Press conferences; Festivals; COVID-19; Narcotics"

"2021-09-04","Full text: Manitoba government to pull controversial bills WINNIPEG - Manitoba's new premier, expected to hold the job for less than nine weeks, is promising to kill five bills currently before the legislature, including one that would overhaul the education system. Kelvin Goertzen, who was chosen interim leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on Tuesday, said he wants to offer a clean slate for the leader and premier chosen by Tory party members in a vote set for Oct. 30. ""A new leader has to be able to set their own agenda,"" Goertzen said in his first news conference, a few hours after he was sworn in Wednesday as the province's 23rd premier. ""That's why I think it's important to remove these five bills."" Goertzen, a legislature member since 2003 and cabinet minister since 2016, was chosen by his caucus colleagues to replace Brian Pallister, who announced last month he would resign. Pallister led the party to two majority election wins but his popularity plummeted in recent months. The next Tory leader could reintroduce the bills in the future, but all three candidates in the race so far have said they would not go ahead with the education one. The bill would eliminate all English-language elected school boards and centralize decision-making. It has run into widespread opposition and lawn signs denouncing it have sprung up across the province. Another bill on the chopping block would crack down on protests that block highways and other infrastructure. A third would allow cabinet to bypass public regulatory hearings on electricity rates and set them unilaterally. Another bill would remove the automatic right to binding arbitration in labour disputes. The fifth would allow for more private liquor sales. Goertzen's intentions are a victory for the Opposition New Democrats, who prevented the bills from coming to a vote in the spring. ""What we saw today is a clear indication from the ... government in its current iteration that they bent to the will of Manitobans,"" NDP Leader Wab Kinew said. Goertzen signalled that he will take a different approach than Pallister. Goertzen spoke frequently of opening up the premier's office to input from Manitobans and said he planned to meet soon with Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman. Bowman has long complained that he could not secure meetings with Pallister. Goertzen also said he has talked to two Tory backbenchers, James Teitsma and Josh Guenter, who recently publicly criticized vaccine mandates. ""The time and the place to bring those differences and challenges is to a caucus, internally, or to a leader,"" Goertzen said. ""I think that they understand that. We'll see in the test of time if ... that message wasn't powerful or didn't resonate enough."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 1, 2021. Subject: Electric rates"

"2021-09-04","Full text: Ontario bringing in vaccine certificate system TORONTO - Giving in to mounting pressure from experts, businesses and political opponents, Premier Doug Ford announced a vaccine certificate system Wednesday that will see Ontarians showing proof of immunization to access public spaces such as restaurants, gyms and movie theatres. But the new system – which takes effect Sept. 22 and won't be required for retail and services such as hair salons – came under criticism for not applying to venue staff and for taking too long to kick in. Ford, who previously denounced vaccine certificates as creating a ""split society,"" said he had changed his mind as the province experiences a fourth wave of infections. ""This is something that I did not want to do. This is a serious step that we're not taking lightly,"" the Progressive Conservative premier told reporters. ""This is a temporary tool that we won’t use for a day longer than we have to."" Ford said the system was needed to protect the vulnerable and avoid another lockdown. He also said, however, that it was being brought in because the federal government had not yet introduced a national vaccine passport. The federal Liberals, who are currently seeking re-election, have said the Canadian government is working on a vaccine passport for international travel. Wednesday's announcement came after weeks of calls for a certificate system from businesses, health worker groups, municipalities, local public health units and opposition politicians. The system won't apply to essential services like health care and grocery stores, or to children under 12 and those with select medical exemptions to COVID-19 vaccines. Locations requiring proof of vaccination are largely those that involve close contact, crowds, and where people don't continuously wear masks. In addition to restaurants, bars and fitness facilities, settings that will require vaccination include nightclubs, meeting and event spaces, casinos, cinemas, music venues, strip clubs and racing venues. The rules won't apply to restaurant patios or takeout services. There will be exceptions for weddings and funeral receptions until Oct. 12, but those attending will have to show a negative COVID-19 test result if they are unvaccinated. The system was announced as the province's science advisers issued new COVID-19 projections that predicted the Delta variant will see more unvaccinated people hospitalized this fall, with intensive care occupancy possibly exceeding the third wave. The COVID-19 Science Advisory Table called for higher vaccination coverage, boosted by policies like vaccine mandates, and limits on in-person contacts to fight the fourth wave. ""To avoid a lockdown in the fall, vaccination needs to accelerate substantially above 85 per cent of eligible population … and we need to reduce contacts to about 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels until vaccination is high enough,"" it wrote. Dr. Kieran Moore, the province's top public health doctor, said the vaccine certificate system will help boost immunization rates, noting that infections and hospitalizations among unvaccinated residents were rising. ""It is critical that we continue to respond with assertive action to protect Ontarians,"" he said, adding that proof of vaccination might be required in more settings going forward. The vaccination certificate requirement won't apply, however, to venue staff. Moore said businesses can introduce their own staff vaccination policies and said they have other measures in place, like regular screening. He also pointed to vaccination-or-testing policies already introduced in hospitals, schools and long-term care homes, noting that some workplaces have moved to mandate vaccines. He said the province might strengthen its policies later if necessary. ""We will move to mandatory if and when we are not achieving the goals that we have to protect patients, children and vulnerables in our community,"" he said. The new system will be phased in. At first, patrons will need to show a paper or digital receipt of vaccination issued by the province along with another form of government identification to gain access to spaces covered by the new rules. On Oct. 22, the province aims to launch a QR code and verification app for businesses to streamline the process. Officials said the app is being developed with help from outside contractors, but wouldn't name those businesses. Officials said some penalties such as fines would apply to individuals and businesses that don't comply with the new rules. The province said it's working on alternatives for people who don't have smartphones or a health card, and also said it would work with Indigenous communities as it brings in the system. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said equitable access to the system shouldn't be an afterthought, and questioned the exemption of venue staff from the policy. She also criticized the announcement as coming too late, without essential tools like the QR code ready to use, which she argued leaves businesses open to harassment when they have to enforce the rules. ""Mr. Ford is still leaving far too many businesses on their own to make tough decisions,"" Horwath said. Liberal and Green party leaders also expressed concern about the timing of the policy's implementation. Rocco Rossi, president of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, said his group supports the vaccine certificate to help prevent another ""devastating"" lockdown for businesses and the economy. He also called for clear provincial guidance on employee vaccination policies. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said businesses have unanswered questions about the new policy including enforcement and training for businesses and protection against lawsuits. It also called for financial support to help businesses enforce the new rules. More than 83 per cent of Ontario residents aged 12 and older had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Wednesday and more than 76 per cent had both doses.

"2021-09-03","Full text: The first six months of 2021 have been the deadliest on record for toxic drugs in British Columbia, claiming the lives of 1,011 people, a third more than the same time last year. The BC Coroners Service reported today that 159 people died in June, the second-highest total for the month in history. In June 2020 185 people died. The report, a grim confirmation that 2021 will be the deadliest year ever without bold action, came as loved ones of the 21,000 Canadians lost to toxic drugs since 2016 marked International Overdose Awareness Day. “Each one of these deaths was preventable,” Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said today. “We continue to seek compassionate, courageous and meaningful solutions to stop the death toll.” B.C. is in its sixth year of the overdose public health emergency, but the province still isn’t treating it like a crisis, Lapointe said. “The public health emergency was declared in 2016 with the best of intentions... with expectation that response would be commensurate with the impact,” she responded to a Tyee question. “We haven’t seen that.” The lack of co-ordinated emergency response is mind-boggling to Leslie McBain, who lost her son Jordan to a fentanyl overdose and co-founded Moms Stop the Harm. “We are doing essentially nothing and expecting things to improve,” she said today. “Why would we allow this dismal and tragic situation to exist?” Meanwhile, the criminalized drug supply has grown increasingly unpredictable and poisoned. Fentanyl contributed to 87 per cent of deaths between 2018 and 2020. Carfentanil, an even more powerful synthetic opioid, has contributed to 96 deaths so far this year, compared to 65 in all of 2020. Paramedics are responding to more than 100 overdoses a day across the province, said Brian Twaites, an advanced life support paramedic for BC Emergency Health Services. And more and more often they are needing to use up to five times the normal dose of naloxone to reverse an overdose from synthetic opioids, which bind more strongly to receptors in the brain. Lapointe said widespread and accessible safe supply needs to be available to offer an alternative to the poisoned illicit supply, in addition to decriminalization of drug possession. “Prescribed drugs, including those prescribed by doctors as safe supply, are not a factor in the drug toxicity crisis. Safe supply is not creating a health-and-safety risk,” she said. Vancouver is currently waiting for federal approval for its decriminalization application. The provincial government has said it will also seek approval to decriminalize possession of drugs for personal use. The NDP promised an expanded safe supply program before last fall’s provincial election. But critics say current government prescribing guidance for safe supply doesn’t go far enough, and won’t stop 2021 and 2022 from becoming consecutive record years for fatalities. Lapointe said without targets for prescribers and access in every community, B.C. is “nowhere near the numbers” we need to stop deaths. Stigma and doctors’ reluctance to prescribe alternatives to illicit drugs continue to prevent people who use substances from seeking and being provided adequate health care, she noted. The “biggest barrier is how slow we are to change our perspective on what’s right and what’s wrong.” Notably absent from today’s announcement were provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, Health Minister Adrian Dix, Premier John Horgan and Minister of Mental Health and Addictions Sheila Malcolmson. None of their offices had released statements to mark International Overdose Awareness Day or acknowledge the new report on deaths when the press conference concluded this morning. Just before 11 a.m. Malcolmson’s office released a statement expressing sorrow for the more than 7,000 lives lost in B.C. over the last five years. “Our government has been creating new drug policy in Canada that will save lives by supporting access to prescribed safer supply and connecting people to health-care services, and by moving forward on decriminalization of people who use drugs,” said Malcolmson in the statement. “We will do everything we can to turn this drug poisoning crisis around.” The province’s all-hands-on-deck pandemic response is “absolutely what we need for the drug toxicity crisis,” Lapointe said. “What we have seen is small steps primarily left to one ministry.” Toxic drug deaths are now the leading cause of years of life lost in the province, affecting mostly men ages 19 to 39. And they are the leading cause of death among young people aged 19 to 39, and come second in the general population, after malignant cancers. McBain said the people dying in communities across the province are important, loved and loving. “They are us,” she said. The June data was reported a month late due to the nearly 600 heat-related deaths in late June’s heat wave, which overwhelmed the BC Coroners Service. The delay will be corrected when July and August data are reported together at the end of September.

Progressive Conservative veteran member Pat Dunn was named to the posts, and he was sworn into office during a ceremony Tuesday in Halifax. There were no Black Tory candidates among the party's 31 members who won ridings in the Aug. 17 provincial election. Houston said Tuesday he considered choosing someone outside the Tory caucus to represent African Nova Scotians, but he felt democracy ""works best"" when people who are elected are put into positions of responsibility. The premier stood by his position today during a news conference about health-care reform. Houston says despite criticism on social media calling his decision ""tone deaf,"" his party ran a diverse slate but none of the Tory's three Black candidates were elected. He says he is making a commitment that the African Nova Scotian community will be heard by his government, adding that ""the buck stops with me"" on the issue. ""I understand the emotions of it but it (the decision) shouldn't be interpreted as not being concerned about listening to the community,"" Houston said.

"2021-09-03","Full text: Quebec cabinet minister back after selling shares Quebec Premier François Legault has welcomed Pierre Fitzgibbon back to cabinet after he withdrew in June because of ethics violations. Legault told a news conference today alongside Fitzgibbon that he will resume his role as economy minister after he sold shares in two companies in order to comply with requirements laid out by the ethics commissioner. Fitzgibbon, who represents the suburban Montreal riding of Terrebonne, told reporters he'd considered leaving politics but ultimately decided he wanted to continue in the role. He also announced he would run again in next year's provincial election. Fitzgibbon left cabinet after he was targeted by the ethics czar for failing to divest himself of shares in two companies that did business with the province and could place him in a conflict of interest. Commissioner Ariane Mignolet recommended Fitzgibbon be suspended from the legislature until he sold those shares or until he resigned from his role as a cabinet minister and placed the shares in a blind trust. Fitzgibbon declined Wednesday to confirm how much money he lost by selling his shares, saying only that it ""wasn't the best financial transaction"" of his career. In June, Fitzgibbon said he stood to lose $1 million if he had accepted the offers he had received at the time. Legault had pledged to reinstate Fitzgibbon when the situation was resolved. In the interim, the role was managed by Finance Minister Eric Girard. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 1, 2021. Subject: Ethics"

"2021-09-03","Full text: A look at Ontario's vax certificate system Ontario says its COVID-19 vaccination certificate program will come into effect Sept. 22. Here's a look at how it will work: How will I show my proof of vaccination? Initially, residents will show a PDF or printout of the vaccination receipt they received when they got their COVID-19 shots, along with a government-issued piece of ID such as a photo health card or driver's licence. The province is expected to launch a system in late October that will send everyone a QR code to accompany their vaccination receipt. It will also launch an app that will allow service providers to scan the QR codes as proof of vaccination.

"2021-09-03","Full text: Kamloops taxpayers will shoulder an increase in police costs in 2022, but how big a bill is still being tabulated. In August, RCMP members ratified their first collective agreement between the federal Treasury Board and the National Police Federation, providing a 23.7 per cent pay increase over six years, retroactive to 2017. Communities across Canada, including Kamloops, are now examining the details of the deal and how it impacts them. The contract covers RCMP members below the rank of inspector — which applies to most of Kamloops’ 132 officers — as well as reservists, with pay rates changing within 90 days of the contract’s Aug. 6 signing. Kamloops Mayor Ken Christian said the contract will result in a tax increase in 2022 and expects the rise in police costs to be “significant.” “The RCMP will be better served by this new contract — I think it’s been overdue — but the funding of it is going to be something the taxpayers need to be prepared for,” he said. How much of a cost taxpayers will bear remains unclear. Christian said the hit to taxpayers will be offset by annual contributions the municipality has been making to its police reserve fund since 2018 in anticipation of the contract. “It won’t be the full 24 per cent,” Christian said, noting the city also doesn’t generally operate with its full complement of officers. Michael Helfrich, the city’s business manager for community protective services, said staff are in the middle of assessing the impact of the new contract on the police budget. Christian said he is expecting to receive a report on the new police costs from the finance department in November as budget talks ramp up, noting the amount will depend on the complement of officers Kamloops has had over the contract term, back pay and the mix of ranks at the Kamloops detachment, along with their new pay scales going forward. “You put all that into a hopper and we’ll come out with a tax increase,” he said. As the new contract was a national negotiation, Christian believes the federal government should be on the hook for the lump sum of back pay Kamloops officers will receive — a point he wants to make with whomever becomes the next member of Parliament for Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo following the Sept. 20 federal election. Asked if there was a way around increasing taxes, Christian said the police force could be reduced, but that’s an option he doesn’t think is wise. “I don’t think it would signal the right direction to be reducing the number of police officers,” he said, noting increased calls for service regarding street-related issues. While the added cost will hit taxpayers, Christian said the pay is needed because of recruitment and retention struggles. Christian said it is his understanding the RCMP is one of the lowest-paying police forces in Canada. “What that means is you don’t get the brightest and best candidates applying to [RCMP Academy] Depot because they could apply to the Justice Institute and wind up in Abbotsford, Victoria or Vancouver [municipal forces] at a lot more money,” Christian said. A 2017 press release from the Mounted Police Professional Association of Canada stated RCMP members were 14.4 percent behind comparable police officers in terms of overall compensation. According to the RCMP’s new pay scale, a first-class constable who earned $86,110 annually in 2016 will earn $106,576 by April 2022, while a corporal who made $94,292 five years ago would see a pay bump to $116,702 next year. The new federal contract runs until March of 2023. Given its population size, Kamloops splits police costs with the federal government, with the city picking up 90 per cent of the costs. The total cost for the city’s RCMP contract for officers is approximately $23 million a year and fluctuates annually, depending on utilization, city officials told KTW. Contractual services for police protection was $22.9 million in 2017, $24.3 million in 2018, $25.4 million in 2019 and a budgeted $27.3 million in 2020, according to the city’s 2020-2024 financial plan. The police budget is the city’s largest line item, accounting for about 12 per cent of the total annual budget. The city is also in the middle of negotiating a new contract for its firefighters — something Christian said he doesn’t think the RCMP contract will impact as those talks are based more on contracts with other fire departments. Kamloops Fire Rescue’s contract and pay scale is based on the average of a number of Lower Mainland fire departments. —This story was changed from an earlier version to correct the year to which the RCMP contract is retroactive.

"2021-09-03","Full text: QUEEN’S PARK – Beginning September 22 you will have to show proof of vaccination to dine indoors, attend a sporting event, or go to the movies. The Ontario government announced its new Enhanced COVID-19 Vaccine Certificate program today (September 1). “Based on the latest evidence and best advice, COVID-19 vaccine certificates give us the best chance to slow the spread of this virus while helping us to avoid further lock-downs,” said Premier Doug Ford during the announcement. “It’s clear the Delta variant is here, and it is a very real threat.” Ford said that a national vaccine passport system was “far better than a patchwork of certificates every single province and territory in the country.” Ontario joins British Columbia, Manitoba, and Quebec who have already implemented or are implementing a vaccine passport system. Ford took a swipe at Liberal leader Justin Trudeau over not launching a federal program which he called the best solution that other countries are already using. “Justin Trudeau has told us that they will not be rolling out a national vaccine passport while their election is ongoing. We can’t wait any longer,” he said. Between September 22 and October 21, people age 12 and older will need their COVID-19 vaccination receipt and a piece of photo identification to enter certain public settings. The government will launch its passport app on October 22, which will tie the vaccination record and id into one QR Code that businesses and venues can scan. “We need to protect our hospitals. We need to avoid lock-downs at all costs. We want our kids in school and our businesses to stay open,” Ford said. The government’s plan targets what it calls “higher-risk” indoor public settings. These settings are where face coverings cannot always be worn such as when eating and drinking. The list includes restaurants and bars – excluding outdoor patios, takeout, and delivery; nightclubs; and meeting/event spaces such as banquet halls and conference centres. Also included are sports and recreation facilities like gyms and fitness clubs but indoor youth recreation sports are exempt from the government requirements. Sporting events, concerts, theatres and music venues are included as well as casinos, bingo halls and gaming venues. People entering strip clubs, bathhouses and sex clubs will require vaccination verification, as well the indoor parts of horse racing tracks, will need to have the vaccine certificate. Essential retail such as grocery stores and pharmacies, and non-essential retail businesses are not part of this system. However any business can use the government tools to confirm vaccinations if they wish. Businesses that do not comply with the vaccine passport will face compliance fines. Not included in the new program are religious settings, barber shops, hair salons, and aesthetics businesses. The passport system does not apply to employees of any of the listed venues as employers are expected to have processes already in place for their employees. Un-vaccinated people with medical exemptions, and people under 12 years old can still enter the venues where vaccine status is verified. Adults accompanying people under 12 need to have a vaccine passport. For people who do not use smartphones or apps, the QR Code can be printed so you will not need to have a smartphone app. Addressing privacy concerns, the QR code system will not give businesses any personal information, only confirm the vaccine status of the person entering. Ford said moving to a vaccine certificate or passport system is not something he did not want to do. “This is a serious step that we’re not taking lightly, and I know this is going to be very difficult for some people,” he explained. “Let me be clear, this is a temporary tool that we won’t use for a day longer than we have to.” Subject: COVID-19 vaccines; Smartphones; Coronaviruses; Immunization"

"2021-09-03","Full text: N.S. unveils team to reform health-care system HALIFAX - Premier Tim Houston wasted no time implementing his campaign promise to reform his province's health system Wednesday, announcing the dismissal of the CEO of the Nova Scotia Health Authority and abolishing the agency's board of directors. The move came one day after Houston and his cabinet were sworn into office. Houston then introduced a four-person ""leadership team"" he said would streamline management and usher in the change Nova Scotians voted for when his Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the Aug. 17 provincial election. The Tory campaign focused almost exclusively on fixing health care and Houston has said repeatedly it would be his government's main priority. ""This is not change for the sake of change,"" Houston told reporters. ""Sometimes you have to hit reset. It's time to refocus the efforts … this is only about improving health care."" The 14-member board of directors was a volunteer body and will no longer be in operation. The Health Department confirmed the severance of outgoing CEO Dr. Brendan Carr is about $400,000. ""Everything is focused on making sure people can access health care,"" Houston said. ""The very first step in getting there is empowering a team of people to get it done."" The new management team will be led by Karen Oldfield — who has no health-care experience. She served in the office of former Tory premier John Hamm and is also the former CEO of the agency that runs the Port of Halifax. Houston appointed her interim CEO of the health authority. Janet Davidson, a former interim CEO of the health authority, is the new administrator of that agency after having served as the outgoing board's chair. The team also includes Dr. Kevin Orrell, who has been appointed CEO of the newly created Office of Health Care Professionals Recruitment, and Jeannine Lagasse, who is the new deputy minister of the Health Department. Orrell's office will report directly to Health Minister Michelle Thompson and its job will be to recruit and retain doctors, nurses, continuing-care assistants (CCAs), paramedics and other health professionals. Orrell said the province is at ""very low capacity"" regarding the number of professionals it needs to deliver quality care. ""Thousands of people are looking for family doctors, there's a vacancy rate … of 20 per cent for nurses and CCAs are in short supply, challenging our long-term care homes,"" he said. Recruitment, Orrell added, needs to be ""stepped up"" and streamlined in order for Nova Scotia to remain competitive with other provinces. Orrell used the example of his daughter, a newly trained doctor, who he said met barriers when she tried to return home to Nova Scotia to work. ""It took months of very awkward negotiation before she was offered the job, but luckily she was dedicated to coming back to the province,"" he said. Houston said the team will tour the province from Sept. 20 to 23 in order to hear from front-line health professionals. Meanwhile, Liberal Leader Iain Rankin said Carr and the board have done ""tremendous"" work over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and he expressed disappointment that health management was being ""condensed to four people."" Rankin said the board was a more diverse reflection of the province's population because it had a Black member and an Indigenous member. ""We need diverse voices at the leadership table, especially in places like health care, so my view is that this is a step backwards,"" he said. NDP Leader Gary Burrill also panned the announcement, noting that his party had been part of a recent battle to get the health authority board meetings opened to the public. ""Having that board done away with, we've lost that transparency, we've lost that accountability — that's of great concern,"" he said.

"2021-09-03","Full text: The Liberal Party is promising, if re-elected, to require the oil and gas industry to curb its greenhouse gas emissions at a pace and scale needed to meet net-zero emissions by 2050, but experts and environmentalists want details before getting their hopes up. The climate plan highlights a number of initiatives, like energy efficiency retrofit grants and making sure all vehicles sold after 2035 are zero-emission vehicles, but the plan’s centrepiece is a commitment to cap and lower emissions from the oil and gas industry — a move experts say has long been the missing piece to a credible climate plan. “We're effectively capping oil and gas emissions in this country, and saying there will be five-year targets that will be established, that will be binding, on the pathway to net zero,” said incumbent North Vancouver candidate Jonathan Wilkinson. “There needs to be a path, and that path needs to be a path that has requirements, not simply aspirational goals,” he added. The plan is to set five-year targets, starting in 2025, based on the advice of the Net-Zero Advisory Body. Wilkinson confirmed the plan is focused on reducing absolute emissions rather than emission intensity per barrel. Emission intensity refers to the emissions generated when producing a product, but from a climate perspective, absolute emissions are what count. “It's fine, and in some respects important, that the sector improves emission intensity, but emission intensity is not sufficient because if you have more improvements … yet increase production, then you end up with an increase in absolute emissions,” said Wilkinson. That means “any expansion with respect to the oilsands would have to fit within the cap we've put in place and the reductions that would be required,” he said. “So the only way you could see significant expansion in the oilsands is if you saw enormous improvements in emission intensity.” Experts Canada’s National Observer spoke with applauded the Liberals for recognizing that emissions in the oil and gas sector need to be regulated if there is any chance to reduce greenhouse gases in line with what science demands, but called the commitment too vague. “How much of this is (based) on carbon capture technology? How much of this is actually stepping in and saying no new expansion?” asked Cam Fenton with climate group 350. “There's way too much wiggle room built into it at this point in time, which is worrying ... There's a very big difference between whether or not this is a plan to wind down versus wind up and offset.” Fenton said the platform doesn’t read like the Liberals grasped the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which United National Secretary General António Guterres called a “code red for humanity.” “This reads more like what have we already promised, what have we put forward, and what're the new things we can add in, particularly to address the most significant critiques we're facing,” he said. “When you look at the things they're most worried about, a lot of it has to do with their foot-dragging on the Just Transition Act, and then the big elephant in the room of the climate plan has always been the lack of a plan for oil and gas emissions. “So this feels more like it's gilding the lily of their existing plan, as opposed to actually reacting or responding to the scale of the crisis.” Pembina Institute’s Alberta regional director Chris Severson-Baker says oil and gas companies that have already made net-zero pledges should welcome the Liberal announcement. “It's sort of counterintuitive, but they've come out and made these pledges and now a major party is announcing that path to net zero is actually going to be part of government policy,” he explained. “Companies have made these net-zero pledges, but without policy certainty and an actual road map, they're going to find it very challenging to actually secure the investment capital they would need.” The most notable net-zero pledge from the oilsands came in June when Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy, the companies responsible for 90 per cent of oilsands production, declared an alliance aimed at reaching net-zero through a multibillion-dollar carbon capture utilization and storage plan that would connect a sequestration hub to the oilsands with a massive trunkline. This week Reuters revealed Natural Resources Canada is planning two major carbon capture projects, estimated to capture 15 million tonnes of carbon annually. Severson-Baker said a suite of policies for the oil and gas sector is what’s needed because the carbon price on its own doesn’t cut it. “You hear it all the time talking to companies and the finance sector (that) they discount the carbon price,” he said. “They discount the carbon signal because they don't have enough details or certainty about how things are going to unfold, and it results in an inability to actually move forward.” He said that five-year plans with clear benchmarks, along with clean fuel regulations, and gradual increases to the carbon price are what provide the type of certainty needed for major investment decisions. Elsewhere in the Liberal climate plan is a commitment to end thermal coal exports by 2030, which builds off a previous goal to phase out domestic thermal coal. In June, Wilkinson also announced what is effectively a ban on new thermal coal mines due to their greenhouse gas impact. “If the argument is, ‘We need to stop exporting thermal coal because it's driving emissions elsewhere,’ the exact same logic applies to oil and gas,” said Keith Stewart, a senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada. Climate Action Network Canada’s domestic policy manager Caroline Brouillette echoed the sentiment. “In Canada we are still not ready to have an honest conversation about what the International Energy Agency's net-zero by 2050 report tells us, which is that to contain global warming to 1.5 C there can be no new investment in fossil fuels,” she said. “It seems like we're ready to address the coal component of that reality, but talking about the end of oil and gas is still a difficult topic in Canada. “Obviously it's a complex and difficult transition that we'll need to undergo, but really this election should be about naming these hard choices that we'll have to make in the coming years,” she said. Another notable commitment in the climate plan is a pledge to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas by 75 per cent from 2012 levels by 2030. That appears to represent a step up from 2016’s commitment to reduce emissions 40 to 45 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. Methane has been identified as a priority for greenhouse gas emission reductions by the IPCC because it warms the planet faster than CO2 but has a shorter life in the atmosphere.

"2021-09-03","Full text: The doors of Liverpool’s historic Town Hall Arts and Cultural Centre and the Astor Theatre will be opened wide when Phase 5 is introduced in a couple of weeks, or at least that’s the hope. “We’re excited that things are progressing in the right direction. The signals are good right now,” said the chair of the Astor Theatre Society, John Simmonds. “But we’ve been disappointed before. We were at this stage at the same time last year,” he added. Several events had to be cancelled in the fall of 2020, following an optimistic summer and a hopeful return to normal activities that didn’t happen. A few small activities have taken place since COVID-19 began, such as a couple of Breath of Fresh Air productions, a municipal election debate and a pared-down music festival. Things ramped up a bit over the summer as actress Ashley-Rose Goodwin hosted three youth theatre camps at the theatre. “She was a great ambassador for us and the camps turned out very well. The kids and parents all enjoyed them,” said Simmonds, adding that he and staff want to make the theatre more appealing and accessible to youth and having these camps is a good start in this endeavour. Art exhibits The summer momentum continued with an art collection by the Mi’kmaw artist Melissa Labrador in August, with more than 30 pieces of her artwork displayed throughout the Town Hall Arts and Cultural Centre, which is also run by the Astor Theatre Society. Simmonds said the show was well attended. This month, the South Shore artists, Janet Stewart and Fran Ornstein, will display a collection of their works at the centre. Live music returning Work on fall musical programming is now taking shape with two concerts fully booked and more to come. “We’re trying to diversify a little bit and bring in music that will appeal to different demographics,” said Simmonds. “I think bringing in some blues music, classics, country and pop will give us a good mix.” First up on the program is the jazz trio featuring drummer/percussionist Nick Halley, pianist Glenn Patscha and composer and double bassist Patrick Reid, who will be appearing September 10. Seating will be limited to 120 people. On October 16, blues artist Charlie A’Court will be teamed up with the Annapolis Valley country rockers, Witchitaw, who are performing in their When Country Gets The Blues Tour. On October 26, the theatre will play host to the Lunch at Allen’s tour, featuring Canadian music legends Murray McLauchlan, Marc Jordan, Cindy Church and Ian Thomas. Staff members also are working to bring popular Elvis impersonator Thane Dunn to the Astor, as well as the group Atlantic String Machine. However, Simmonds advises all of these acts hinge on the prevailing COVID-19 regulations set by the province. “We want to make promises and commitments because we’re getting all kinds of people coming to us. Our social media pages are busy and people are asking, ‘when are you going to start movies, when is the programming going to start?’” he said. “So there’s a lot of built-up interest and we want to be able to start serving those needs as soon as we can.” Safety Under current government health regulations, Astor Theatre can entertain up to 120 people inside. Should the province enter its Stage 5 in the pandemic, the theatre should be able to return to its capacity seating of 350. However, Simmonds assures that health safety will remain a priority. “We will always maintain the safest of COVID-19 protocols. We want to err on the side of caution, and we want to make sure everybody feels 100 per cent safe in coming into the theatre,” said Simmonds. “We will ensure our staff and volunteers are fully vaccinated and will continue to wear masks until it is abundantly clear that we no longer need to.” He added they are unsure of what action regarding vaccination of audience members they are going to take and will continue to monitor provincial guidelines and follow the lead of other major venues. Projector update Meanwhile, the work to fix the projector continues. After eight months of waiting for a technician to come from New Brunswick to replace a part, following his recent visit it was discovered that he will have to return. Simmonds anticipates that they can begin showing movies again by the end of September. Subject: Theater; Coronaviruses; Society; COVID-19; Art exhibits"
"2021-09-03","Full text: N.B. premier says not yet for vaccine passports FREDERICTON - Vaccine passports aren't needed right now in New Brunswick, but they could be issued in the future to make travel more easy within Canada, Premier Blaine Higgs said Wednesday. The province isn't seeing the high levels of cases and COVID-19-related hospitalizations being experienced in provinces such as Quebec, where a vaccine passport system was launched Wednesday, Higgs told reporters. ""We don't have the urgency that Quebec or Ontario have because their level of hospitalizations and their outbreak of cases, their density of population is very different from ours,"" he said. About 75.5 per cent of eligible New Brunswickers are fully vaccinated and 84.7 per cent have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the premier added. Meanwhile, health officials reported 11 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday and 21 more recoveries from the disease. New Brunswick has 127 active reported cases and three people in hospital, including one in intensive care. Higgs said if more provinces start to require proof of vaccination, New Brunswick may have to introduce a vaccine passport in order to ensure residents can easily travel within Canada. ""I think what we're going to find is that basically, if you want to travel outside of New Brunswick it may become necessary,"" Higgs said. ""If our residents are restricted because of the need for verification on a standardized basis then that would be the impetus to do so at this point,"" he said. ""Right now we're quite comfortable where we stand."" Higgs said with the end of summer and start to the school year there has been a rise in the number of people getting vaccinated. He said if that stalls, it may become a reason to impose vaccination passports. The premier said public health and information technology staff are looking at what would be needed to introduce online vaccination passports for use on smartphones. He said he also wanted to be sure the rules are clear in case businesses such as restaurants ask for passports from customers. Higgs said he's hoping to get some direction from the federal government. The federal Liberals have promised during the election campaign $1 billion to the provinces to subsidize their vaccine passport systems. ""The federal government is pushing for a standardized policy so when we put it in place we do it right,"" he said. ""It likely will come but there's not a sense of urgency here. The important thing is to do it right."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 1, 2021. Subject: Provinces; COVID-19 vaccines; Coronaviruses; Immunization"

"2021-09-03","Full text: Anti-racism advocates are calling on key political leaders in Canada to publicly renounce Quebec’s Bill 21 “secularism” law during this election campaign. The law, described by the advocates as “state-sanctioned hate and bigotry against racialized religious minorities,” restricts the wearing of ‘religious symbols’ by public servants in positions of authority such as teachers, police officers, judges, and lawyers. It includes a ban on religious symbols such as crosses, hijabs, turbans and yarmulkes. “If Justin Trudeau, Erin O’Toole and Jagmeet Singh are sincere about supporting the fight against hate, bigotry and racism, they must stand strongly against the ethno-nationalism that is being promoted by the Quebec government through its secularism law,” Fareed Khan, founder of the group called Canadians United Against Hate, said in a press release this morning. “It’s intolerable that all federalist party leaders have not come together to unequivocally stand against the law, and support legal challenges to defend the rights of Canadians under the Charter. They have sacrificed the human rights of certain religious communities in Quebec on the altar of political expediency, and that is unacceptable.” The statement comes in the wake of comments by Bloc Quebecois leader Yves Francois- Blanchet, who at a media conference in Sherbrooke, Quebec described efforts to kill the bill by Quebecers as “reprehensible.” “What is reprehensible is Mr. Blanchet’s support for Quebec’s ‘secularism’ law which is state-sanctioned hate and bigotry against racialized religious minorities,” Khan said. “We expect politicians in overtly racist and fascist states to say such things, but to hear it from a Canadian politician is galling and demonstrates his support for racist and ethno-nationalist politics in Quebec.” He continued: “For him to say that it was ‘reprehensible’ for Quebecers to challenge that law in court, which is their legal right, is saying ‘sit down and shut up’ to people whose rights are being trampled by the Quebec government. His comments show a total disrespect for the legal rights of Canadians living in Quebec, and is the attitude of a politician who believes in approaches used by authoritarian regimes.”"

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 1 ... What we are watching in Canada ... Less than three weeks to go before the Sept. 20 federal election, and the three main party leaders are staying central. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau begins his day with an announcement in Toronto. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole is also in Ontario, with a morning announcement at the Ottawa hotel he has been using as his main base throughout the campaign. New Democrat head Jagmeet Singh is in Quebec for a housing announcement in Montreal, followed by a virtual town hall in the evening. Affordability was a key election talking point on the campaign trail alongside the economy on Tuesday, as Statistics Canada reported the economy contracted at an annualized rate of 1.1 per cent between April and June, and estimated another drop in real gross domestic product in July. Experts say when the economy is good, or perceived to be going in the right direction, voters are inclined to reward the incumbent government. They also say when voters feel the opposite, they are inclined to punish the incumbent. --- Also this ... A health law professor says a belief by some that a medication used to deworm cattle and horses can treat COVID-19 shows how ideology can lead people to embrace misinformation. Timothy Caulfield from the University of Alberta is a critic of alternative medicine and says it's fascinating to watch people looking for ivermectin. He says rejecting a proven vaccine in favour of an unproven drug shows an incredible disconnect. One animal feed store in Alberta says it has been receiving steady requests for its ivermectin. Lance Olson, the manager of Lone Star Tack and Feed near Calgary, says he started receiving calls last November and people are still asking for the product. He says the drug has been removed from the shelves as a precaution. The US Food and Drug Administration has also issued a warning on its website against using ivermectin to treat COVID-19. It adds people should never take medications intended for animals. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... NEW ORLEANS — Louisiana communities battered by Hurricane Ida are now dealing with the possibility of weeks without power in the stifling, late-summer heat. Ida ravaged the region’s power grid, leaving one million people and businesses in Louisiana without power. The New Orleans airport remained closed to commercial flights for a third day on Tuesday. “We have a lot of work ahead of us and no one is under the illusion that this is going to be a short process,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said as the cleanup and rebuilding began across the soggy region in the oppressive late-summer heat. New Orleans officials announced seven places around the city people could get a meal and sit in air conditioning. Edwards said that state officials likewise were working to set up places to distribute food, water and ice, but that it wouldn't start Tuesday. Renell Debose spent a week suffering in the New Orleans Superdome after 2005′s Hurricane Katrina left the city nearly uninhabitable. She said she is willing to give it a few days without electricity, but no more than that. “I love my city. I’m built for this. But I can’t make it without any air conditioning,” she said. Shelly Huff, who like Debose was waiting for gas at a Costco, said: “It’s been rough. Not having power is probably the worst thing. But I have great neighbours, one who evacuated left us a generator. We’ve been sharing food and supplies, so it hasn’t been too bad.”"
"2021-09-03","Full text: NEW GLASGOW – Sean Fraser (Liberal Party) is certainly no stranger to the halls of federal power. Over the past six years as the Member of Parliament for Central Nova, he’s served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and to the Minister of Middle-Class Prosperity and Associate Minister of Finance. Still, he says, it’s the little things that count. “It’s the really small communities that can tell you exactly what their priorities are,” he says. “I’ve seen the extraordinarily good that can take place when our elected officials are get to work to serve people in our communities.” Fraser grew up in Pictou County and has family throughout the Town and County of Antigonish. He graduated from East Pictou Rural High School and holds a law degree from Dalhousie University, a Masters degree in Public International Law from the Netherlands’ Leiden University, and a Bachelor of Science from St. Francis Xavier University. What are your top priorities and why do you think your party is the best choice at this time? “The world has changed in the last year-and-a-half – everyone knows that. The decisions that we make in terms of how we build the recovery from COVID-19 are going to have impacts that last generation or more. Our party is focused on the things that matter to people in our community – things like strengthening the health care plan, like the prime minister’s [recent] announcement about expanding access to doctors and nurses in our communities. “We’ve got to focus on creating jobs at home and making sure we can support people in businesses, getting back to work and extending new support to people who need them in our community. “As we build the recovery, we want to make sure that we do it in a way that is sustainable from an environmental perspective. And we are laser focused on making sure that the economic recovery works for everyone and not just the wealthiest members of society. “What I’ve been hearing as a core part of the COVID-19 economic response team is that we need to ensure we don’t just define the recovery with tax cuts for large corporations and wealthy individuals and hope that this trickles down to the rest of us. “We need to make sure that we make the investments in communities and in people and in small and medium sized businesses as well, to ensure that the economic recovery is sustainable and inclusive and work for all of us.” What are you hearing from voters? “I’ve been hearing that health care is a priority. “I’ve been hearing that the protecting our environment is a priority. “I’ve been hearing that the affordability is a priority. “It’s the really small communities that can tell you exactly what their priorities are. You don’t have to go read the national headlines to understand that health care is a priority when you knock on people’s doors and they say I haven’t got access to a family doctor. “You don't need to talk to national stakeholder organizations of seniors when your community is telling you that groceries are getting awfully expensive and they need a little extra help. “You don’t need to just listen to the recent UN report, which describes in alarming language the climate crisis, when you’ve got people on the St. Mary’s River who explain to you that a little extra conservation can restore potentially endangered salmon populations. “ It’s really refreshing to get out and be chatting with people in the communities after a year-and-a-half of mostly being locked down – because their priorities around the cost of living, around the environment, around health care, and getting the economy back on track tell me everything I need to know.” Why are you running in this election? “The reason I decided to reoffer to be reelected as the Member of Parliament for Central Nova is that over the past six years, I’ve seen the extraordinarily good that can take place when our elected officials are get to work to serve people in our communities. “Sure, there are national policies that have made a heck of a difference. And if I could point to specifics around the Canada … child benefits, a new climate plan, tax cuts for the middle class, benefits for students and seniors. “But as a local representative, which is very important to me, we’ve seen projects at home get advanced that would not have been possible under a different government. “We’ve seen extraordinary multimillion-dollar conservation efforts on the St. Mary’s River. We’ve seen a new facility for adults with intellectual disabilities go forward in Sherbrooke. We’ve got a new fire hall and, in the area, we’re seeing high-speed internet come to communities along the Number 7 Highway. “These are the kinds of projects that are going forward and are not just happening in our large urban centers …These are reaching these small communities. It’s refreshing to see as a local MP that you can have that kind of an impact and make sure that the big things happen in small communities.” Subject: Economic recovery; Members of Parliament; Tax cuts; Coronaviruses; COVID-19"

"2021-09-03","Full text: The first six months of 2021 have been the deadliest on record for toxic drugs in British Columbia, claiming the lives of 1,011 people, a third more than the same time last year. The BC Coroners Service reported today that 159 people died in June, the second-highest total for the month in history. In June 2020 185 people died. The report, a grim confirmation that 2021 will be the deadliest year ever without bold action, came as loved ones of the 21,000 Canadians lost to toxic drugs since 2016 marked International Overdose Awareness Day. “Each one of these deaths was preventable,” Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said today. “We continue to seek compassionate, courageous and meaningful solutions to stop the death toll.” B.C. is in its sixth year of the overdose public health emergency, but the province still isn’t treating it like a crisis, Lapointe said. “The public health emergency was declared in 2016 with the best of intentions … with expectation that response would be commensurate with the impact,” she responded to a Tyee question. “We haven’t seen that.” The lack of co-ordinated emergency response is mind-boggling to Leslie McBain, who lost her son Jordan to a fentanyl overdose and co-founded Moms Stop the Harm. “We are doing essentially nothing and expecting things to improve,” she said today. “Why would we allow this dismal and tragic situation to exist?” Meanwhile, the criminalized drug supply has grown increasingly unpredictable and poisoned. Fentanyl contributed to 87 per cent of deaths between 2018 and 2020. Carfentanil, an even more powerful synthetic opioid, has contributed to 96 deaths so far this year, compared to 65 in all of 2020. Paramedics are responding to more than 100 overdoses a day across the province, said Brian Twaites, an advanced life support paramedic for BC Emergency Health Services. And more and more often they are needing to use up to five times the normal dose of Naloxone to reverse an overdose from synthetic opioids, which bind more strongly to receptors in the brain. Lapointe said widespread and accessible safe supply needs to be available to offer an alternative to the poisoned illicit supply, in addition to decriminalization of drug possession. “Prescribed drugs, including those prescribed by doctors as safe supply, are not a factor in the drug toxicity crisis. Safe supply is not creating a health-and-safety risk,” she said. Vancouver is currently waiting for federal approval for its decriminalization application. The provincial government has said it will also seek approval to decriminalize possession of drugs for personal use. The NDP promised an expanded safe supply program before last fall’s provincial election. But critics say current government prescribing guidance for safe supply doesn’t go far enough, and won’t stop 2021 and 2022 from becoming consecutive record years for fatalities. Lapointe said without targets for prescribers and access in every community, B.C. is “nowhere near the numbers” we need to stop deaths. Stigma and doctors’ reluctance to prescribe alternatives to illicit drugs continue to prevent people who use substances from seeking and being provided adequate health care, she noted. The “biggest barrier is how slow we are to change our perspective on what’s right and what’s wrong.” Notably absent from today’s announcement were provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, Health Minister Adrian Dix, Premier John Horgan and Minister of Mental Health and Addictions Sheila Malcolmson. None of their offices had released statements to mark International Overdose Awareness Day or acknowledge the new report on deaths when the press conference concluded this morning. Just before 11 a.m. Malcolmson’s office released a statement expressing sorrow for the more than 7,000 lives lost in B.C. over the last five years. “Our government has been creating new drug policy in Canada that will save lives by supporting access to prescribed safer supply and connecting people to health-care services, and by moving forward on decriminalization of people who use drugs,” said Malcolmson in the statement. “We will do everything we can to turn this drug poisoning crisis around.” The province’s all-hands-on-deck pandemic response is “absolutely what we need for the drug toxicity crisis,” Lapointe said. “What we have seen is small steps primarily left to one ministry.” Toxic drug deaths are now the leading cause of years of life lost in the province, affecting mostly men ages 19 to 39. And they are the leading cause of death among young people aged 19 to 39, and come second in the general population, after malignant cancers. McBain said the people dying in communities across the province are important, loved and loving. “They are us,” she said. The June data was reported a month late due to the nearly 600 heat-related deaths in late June’s heat wave, which overwhelmed the BC Coroners Service. The delay will be corrected when July and August data are reported together at the end of September.

Psychologist Todd Cunningham, who specializes in academic interventions for students with learning disabilities, says it's likely that students will be returning to school with a wide range of academic needs that schools should be prepared to meet. He says students have had unequal access to online learning during the pandemic and some have struggled more than others, leaving them disconnected from school for over a year and a half and threatening some core skills like reading and mathematics. Cunningham recommends teachers take care to help students feel comfortable at school again before prioritizing coursework. The provincial government says its research into COVID-19's impact on students shows the need for a focus on early literacy and math as students return to class, as well as a need for mental health supports.

The last U.S. Air Force evacuation flight from Kabul airport late Monday marked the end of a frantic effort to get out Americans, Afghans and others desperate to escape the Taliban's return to power 20 years after they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion.

He said he asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken to co-ordinate with international partners in holding the Taliban to their promise of safe passage for Americans and others who want to leave in the days ahead. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... BRUSSELS — The European Union has recommended that its 27 nations reinstate restrictions on tourists from the U.S. because of rising coronavirus infections there, but EU nations can still allow fully vaccinated U.S. travellers in if they want. The decision by the European Council to remove the U.S. from a safe list of countries for non-essential travel reverses its advice in June, when the bloc recommended lifting restrictions on U.S. travellers before the summer tourism season. The guidance is non-binding, though, and U.S. travellers should expect a mishmash of travel rules across the continent. The EU’s decision reflects growing anxiety that the rampant spread of the virus in the U.S. could jump to Europe at a time when Americans are allowed to travel to the continent. Both the EU and the U.S. have faced rising infections this summer, driven by the more contagious delta variant. More than 15 million Americans a year visited Europe before the coronavirus crisis, and new travel restrictions could cost European businesses billions in lost travel revenues, especially in tourism-reliant countries like Croatia, which has been surprised by packed beaches and hotels this summer. U.S. travellers would have to be immunized with one of the vaccines approved by the bloc, which includes Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson. Possible restrictions on them could include quarantines, further testing requirements upon arrival or even a total ban on all non-essential travel from the U.S. In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki stressed Monday that the EU travel restrictions applied to the unvaccinated, adding that “the fastest path to reopening travel is for people to get vaccinated, to mask up and slow the spread of the deadly virus.” --- On this day in 1988 ... The Conservative majority in the House of Commons gave final approval to the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, with a vote of 177 to 64. --- In entertainment ... TORONTO — After lengthy delays and months of internet hype, Drake is promising his new album ""Certified Lover Boy"" will be out on Friday. It is the Toronto rapper's first full-length album in three years. Early Monday, Drake uploaded an image composed of 12 pregnant women emojis alongside the album title and date. Elliott Wilson, the chief content officer of the Tidal streaming music service, tweeted saying the emoji creation was Drake's official ""Certified Lover Boy"" album art. It's a cryptic design that almost instantly had people talking on social media. Some wondered if Drake, born Aubrey Graham, was sending a coded message to his fans, while others criticized the simplicity of the design. But the cover might be a subtle nod to the lengthy gestation period ""Certified Lover Boy"" faced before its due date was set. Originally, the album was expected last January, but Drake postponed the release after suffering a knee injury. The new date is almost nine months later. --- ICYMI ... BEIJING — China is banning children from playing online games for more than three hours a week, the harshest restriction so far on the game industry as Chinese regulators continue cracking down on the technology sector. Regulators announced that minors in China can only play games between 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays, weekends and on public holidays starting Sept. 1. That limits gaming to three hours a week for most weeks of the year, down from a previous restriction set in 2019 that allowed minors play games for 90 minutes per day and three hours on public holidays. The restriction is part of an ongoing crackdown on technology companies amid concerns that they may have an outsized influence on society. The new regulation affects some of China’s largest technology companies, including gaming giant Tencent, whose Honor of Kings online multiplayer game is hugely popular globally, as well as gaming company NetEase. Earlier this month, Tencent said it would limit gaming time for minors to an hour a day and two hours during holidays, as well as ban children under the age of 12 from making in-game purchases. The company issued the curbs hours after a state-affiliated newspaper criticized the gaming industry and called games “spiritual opium.” --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 31, 2021 Subject: Students; Airports; Pandemics; Restrictions; Holidays & special occasions; Tourism; Coronaviruses; Distance learning; Games; COVID-19"

"2021-09-02","Full text: O'Toole, Singh campaign denounce protesters OTTAWA - Erin O'Toole warned supporters Saturday that they're not welcome on the Conservative campaign if they engage in harassment and intimidation of other party leaders. The leader's warning came one day after several Conservative campaign workers were spotted among a crowd of raucous protesters who forced the cancellation of a Liberal event featuring Justin Trudeau in Bolton, Ont. At least four volunteers for local Conservative MP Kyle Seeback were photographed among the angry, obscenity-spewing crowd, wearing blue ""Team Seeback"" T-shirts. Seeback issued a statement late Friday saying those individuals are no longer welcome on his campaign. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also condemned the protesters, saying no one should have to cancel an event over safety concerns. O'Toole insisted Saturday there's no room in the Conservative campaign for negativity. ""We're running on a positive campaign for the future of this country,"" he said during a stop in Fredericton. ""I strongly condemn any form of harassment and protest the like we've seen. We're a democracy, we should be having a healthy and respectful debate of ideas and we have no time for people who bring in negativity to campaigning."" O'Toole appealed to everyone to ""put the country and our democracy first"" and said that's the behaviour he expects from ""every single member of our team, from the leader to the first time someone's volunteering."" Trudeau has been dogged by protesters throughout the campaign, most of them voicing angry opposition to mandatory vaccinations, masks and lockdowns that have been implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. A planned event in Bolton on Friday evening was cancelled because, Trudeau said later, the RCMP determined that it could not keep attendees safe. Questions have arisen over who is organizing and potentially funding the protesters. One man who showed up to heckle Trudeau at an event in Hamilton earlier in the week, turned up the next day at a Trudeau event in Surrey, B.C. He declined to give his name but when asked by reporters if someone was paying him to follow the leader around the country, he said, ""Maybe."" The Liberal campaign has been avoiding making the specific location of many Trudeau events public, partly to limit the number of their own supporters who show up during the pandemic but also to curb opportunities for protesters to organize. But protesters appear to be mobilizing through social media, including Facebook groups such as ""Ontario Protests and Freedom to Assemble Information Page."" The purported ""administrator"" of that page is a Barrie, Ont., woman who posted a message Friday detailing the time and location of Trudeau's Bolton event and inquiring whether anyone was ""going to heckle"" him. Zelda Orser said in an interview Saturday that her role was strictly to post a screenshot of a notice that had been posted elsewhere on social media about the Bolton event. She said she has been administrating the Ontario protest page temporarily because the originator, Naz Obredor, was banned by Facebook for 30 days. The page, she said, is intended to simply inform people about various protests over pandemic restrictions. She said the page is not intended to be partisan. ""I didn't attend (the Bolton event). I didn't organize it ... If people want to go and act like idiots, that's on them,"" Orser said. One Facebook comment, a screenshot of which was posted to Twitter, wondered whether someone was going to punch Trudeau in his ""communist face."" Some Liberal supporters on Twitter drew a link Saturday between that kind of sentiment and Conservative ads on social media, which feature a boxer punching through glass with the tag line ""fight back for Canada's recovery."" But O'Toole, who has rejected Trudeau's calls for mandatory vaccinations for everyone in federally regulated workplaces and for a federal fund to help provinces create vaccine passports, rejected suggestions that he shares some responsibility for inflaming protesters. He reiterated that he encourages all Canadians to get vaccinated but respects their personal choice. ""We will always respect people making their personal health decisions,"" he said, adding that he will similarly honour provinces' right to decide whether to create so-called passports that would enable people to show proof of vaccination. At least some of the protesters appear to share views with supporters of former U.S. president Donald Trump, seemingly importing many of the conspiracy theories prevalent among his followers that led to last January's violent assault on the U.S. Capitol. In a live videostream of the Bolton event, protesters can be heard calling Trudeau a criminal, a communist, a murderer and a pedophile and berating police for being ""pedophile protectors."" In the video, posted on Facebook by a self-identified American woman, a woman can be heard saying that if Trudeau wins the election, it will be because it was ""rigged."" Despite their professed concern about exploitation of children, some of the protesters were accompanied by their young kids and can be heard laughing when one little girl shouts ""F--- Trudeau,"" echoing the chant of adults around her. In another video making the rounds on social media, shot Friday at a Trudeau appearance in Nobleton, Ont., a male protester can be seen yelling at the parents of a toddler who is wearing a mask. He calls it ""sickening,"" while a woman in the background can be heard shouting about ""child abuse"" and ""child trafficking."" Earlier in the week, during Trudeau's event in Surrey, one protester yelled at Trudeau, ""We will end you"" while another shouted that no one wants him to breathe. The number and vigilance of police in Trudeau's security detail have visibly increased during this campaign. The Liberals declined to comment on security arrangements. The RCMP, who are responsible for the prime minister's security, said in a statement Saturday that throughout the campaign, the force ""undertakes risk and threat assessments on an ongoing basis and adapt its security posture accordingly. However, from a security standpoint, we will not disclose such information."" The Mounties added: ""Public order is the responsibility of the local police of jurisdiction. Police will respect individual’s rights to freedom of expression and demonstration in a lawful manner. In the event of any unlawful acts, including public order issues, police will respond in an appropriate and professional manner in accordance with the law."""

"2021-09-02","Full text: Outgoing Manitoba premier urges caucus unity BOISSEVAIN, Man. - Brian Pallister outlined two final projects and warned against division in his Progressive Conservative caucus as he made his last public appearances as Manitoba premier on Monday. Pallister announced $260,000 of his own money for new and enhanced scholarships at Brandon University, his alma mater. Later, he promised $7.5 million in government funds for infrastructure work at the International Peace Gardens on the border with North Dakota. ""There are no easy decisions in life, and this has been one of the hardest ones I've ever had to make,"" Pallister said about his decision to leave. ""I've seen past leaders try to hang on for too long sometimes. I don't want to be one of those."" Pallister, 67, said earlier in the month he was preparing to step down. After the Progressive Conservative party set an Oct. 30 date to elect his replacement, he said he would resign as premier Wednesday and stay on for a few weeks as a member of the legislature to finish constituency work. The Tory caucus is to meet Tuesday to choose an interim leader. Pallister said he ""would have loved"" to have stayed on to hold the annual premiers conference set for Winnipeg in October. But he decided to step aside early to ensure there was no appearance he was influencing the election of his successor. So far, former member of Parliament Shelly Glover, former health minister Heather Stefanson and Tory backbencher Shannon Martin have said they plan to run. Also on Monday, Pallister issued a warning to two backbenchers — James Teitsma and Josh Guenter — who have spoken out against the government's vaccine mandate. He said the dissent hurts the party's political fortunes. ""When you start acting like the opposition, you should prepare to be in the opposition,"" he said. ""You were elected to be part of a team of government ... you're actually hurting your colleagues when you do that."" Pallister took over the Tory leadership in 2012 and bolstered party memberships and finances. He led the party to the largest majority government in a century in 2016 and to re-election in 2019. After fulfilling promises to balance the budget and cut the provincial sales tax, Pallister's popularity dropped as the COVID-19 pandemic grew. Manitoba has had the second-highest per-capita death rate and was forced to ship dozens of intensive care patients out of province because of a hospital bed shortage. Political analyst Paul Thomas said Pallister will be remembered for succeeding in his first term. But his belief in smaller government and lower spending made it hard for him to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, Thomas added. ""His basic belief system made it hard for him to respond in an appropriate manner to the magnitude of the crises he was facing,"" said Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba. ""He came up against an unforeseen emergency and that meant — grudgingly, slowly, reluctantly — he had to loosen the purse strings.""

The final U.S. C-17 transport plane departed Hamid Karzai International Airport at 3:29 p.m. ET — one minute to midnight in Kabul, where the Taliban had vowed to hold President Joe Biden's administration to its Tuesday deadline to leave. ""I'm here to announce the completion of our withdrawal from Afghanistan and the end of the military mission to evacuate American citizens, third-country nationals and vulnerable Afghans,"" said Gen.

""Tonight, withdrawal signifies both the end of the military component of the evacuation, but also the end of the nearly 20-year mission that began in Afghanistan shortly after Sept. 11, 2001.""

"2021-09-01","Full text: After eight years in office, Councillor Ron Govenlock (Division 3, Whitecourt Central) is looking to the future of Woodlands County just as he did when he first began his political journey. ""I had quite a few concerns at that time. We've been able to move forward with some, and some are still pending. The primary objectives were to make sure that residents of Woodlands County were equally represented in the planning and development of this region,"" he explained. Speaking to the breakdown of the relationship between Woodlands County and the Town of Whitecourt, Govenlock said that building it back up is vital. ""When you can work together, then everyone wins. But when one partner takes for granted a minority partner and tries to impose expectations on the other, it is typical for those relationships to fail and for conflict to result. Partnerships have to be a voluntary process with respect for the limitations and philosophies of each of the partners. I can assure you that the Town of Whitecourt is every bit as important to Woodlands County as Woodlands County is to the Town of Whitecourt and the overall region."" When asked if he felt that the dissolution was on the horizon back when he first joined the council, Govenlock said no. ""I can't say I anticipated the outcome that we are addressing at present. My objective was to attempt to correct the imbalance I saw when we, Woodlands County specifically, were being asked to pay virtually 100 percent of the airport operations for a service that mutually benefited both municipalities. We could not make progress in addressing those kinds of things. It resulted in a conflict that has grown proportionately out of control."" As for positive outcomes, Govenlock said that there were more negatives due to the economy and COVID. ""I wanted to achieve controlling the expense side that Woodlands is subjected to and make sure that taxes don't disproportionately rise. Unfortunately, in the last four years, I've seen more things going sideways. I think the first four years that I spent with my colleagues on council, we made some real progress on addressing some of the spending expectations that were part of the budget discussions at the time."" One positive point is that he felt the communication with residents grew. ""That's always been a very important component for me. Unfortunately, because of COVID, we've probably fallen short of what I would like to see. Still, as an elected official, I believe strongly that if you make a decision, you need to be accountable to your residents and have conversations with them. I'm very adamant that the communication with residents is a priority as we move forward to ensure their involvement and reflect their expectations."" He said that though technology helped navigate in-person restrictions, it's just one of the tools they should be using. ""Personal relationships, where you come face to face and shake hands and have a conversation with a resident or another municipal partner, are far for important than virtual opportunities."" Speaking with residents is something Govenlock said is a priority for him as he seeks re-election this fall. ""I enjoy every conversation I have with my residents. I strongly believe that many residents are far too busy. Having the background that I have to bring forward those kinds of concerns in a public manner is a very rewarding component."" As a former teacher of nearly 30 years, Govenlock said some of his past students are now his neighbours. ""I believe having lived in the community for nearly 70 years gives me a very useful background for understanding both the historical perspectives and decisions that took place."" He said that public life and working with various groups such as the Lion's Club, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and the Alberta Teacher's Association have helped him be a public spokesperson. ""It's a role I am reasonably comfortable at and enjoy doing."" With two sons of his own, Govenlock said they are a focus for him in his role as councillor. He said that trying to give them a better future than he enjoyed is something he strives for. ""They are one of the reasons I work as hard as I do and give up as much as I do for their future opportunities."" Looking at the issues Woodlands County will face in the next term, Govenlock said they need to look at other municipalities to see what they have done to make appropriate changes. ""Woodlands County needs a vision as we move forward, given some of the tax challenges and the uncertainty of the future of the oil and gas industry. We need a plan to be a sustainable and affordable municipality. I want to move forward with some of my goals to finish off things I've started and make some of the changes that I believe will benefit all the residents of Woodlands County."" Govenlock has faced some controversy through Code of Conduct issues that remain nearly fully sealed from the public's eye. ""Censorship is not something that can be broadly used to control the opinions and goals of elected officials in particular. We should be inviting feedback and not scared of it,"" referencing the Letter to the Editor article he wrote two years ago that encouraged feedback. ""I'm not interested in seeing someone sitting at the table as a ""yes"" person. I want to see people who are genuinely interested in the municipality's wellbeing and representing their constituents. Questions need to be asked, and conversations need to be had. You can't lose by getting all the facts on the table. I believe in myself and the job I am doing."" Subject: Verbal communication"

"2021-09-01","Full text: When the remains of 215 Indigenous children were found at the site of a former residential school in Kamloops, B.C., Darcele Carroll watched her father, who had also attended residential school, experience survivors’ guilt. “I was sitting here crying, and asking myself as part of the new generation what can I do?” said Carroll. That’s when Carroll decided to walk to Ottawa to raise awareness about the vast disenfranchisement that Indigenous people in Canada experience and to protest the Indian Act, a treaty that in the past has led to the colonization and harm of the Indigenous people. The Healing Generations of Walkers march is set to take place on Sept. 1 at 8 a.m., starting at the Healing of Seven Generations office on Frederick Street in Kitchener and ending at Ottawa’s Parliament Hill. All proceeds of the march will go to the Healing of Seven Generations, an organization in Waterloo Region that assists survivors of the residential school system. Canada’s history is interwoven with the disenfranchisement of Indigenous people from the Indian Act to the hundreds of murdered and missing Indigenous women that have still yet to be found, says Carroll. The Indian Act initially established the process in which the government was able to acquire Indigenous land, assimilate Indigenous people into settler culture and take a paternal view toward Indigenous child welfare, according to the Canadian Encyclopedia. James Young, Carroll’s husband and co-organizer of the Healing Generations of Walkers says that despite some of the perceived benefits of the Indian Act, it’s an unnecessary document that does more harm than good. “It doesn’t actually protect us from anything it is giving,” Young said. “It’s supposed to protect anybody from getting Indian status that shouldn’t. Well, the simple fact is Indian status is just giving Indigenous people another number, like residential schools or the Holocaust in Germany. You know anybody who wanted to get through safe and sound had to show their number from the Holocaust,” said Young referring to the tattooed number concentration camp prisoners would get during the Holocaust. “We have to show a paper that says we’re Native and that we do have rights to this land,” said Young. “We’re just another number to the government.” Carroll says that having Indigenous people be seen as fully human is part of her goal in doing this walk. “Indigenous people are still not treated as people, how can Canada pride itself on diversity when there’s a population that you don’t care about,” said Carroll. Less than a month away from a federal election, Carroll says that she is disappointed that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not addressing Indigenous issues, calling his past remarks insincere. “Jagmeet Singh is the only politician asking, ‘what can we do?’ said Carroll “He’s the one bringing up issues about clean drinking water that the majority of Indigenous people don’t have access to.” Carroll says that she wants to see the government uniting people instead of pitting people against each other. “I want our government to stop trying to pit races against each other because in the end it’s not about the colour of your skin,” said Carroll. “There’s only one race, the human race, and we all bleed the same blood. “We can make Canada amazing if we learn from our past, and admit to our past,” Caroll said. “Yes we have a dark history in Canada, but we can grow from it. “I’m just one person with my husband trying to just bring hindsight to things that we can fix in Canada. Because I love Canada, I love my culture and I love my heritage, but we have so much we need to fix.” STORY BEHIND THE STORY: When Darcele Carroll contacted the Cambridge Times to say that she would be walking to Ottawa to raise awareness for Indigenous issues, reporter Genelle Levy decided to follow up with her to hear her thoughts on what’s impacting the Indigenous community."

Information and Privacy Commissioner Tricia Ralph says the department accessed a decade’s worth of medical visits and diagnostic results that included sensitive information to create a risk rating letter to the registry.

"2021-09-01","Full text: --- (FedElxn-Liberals) Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's campaign ran into more profanity-spewing protesters Sunday as he returned to the hustings in Cambridge, Ontario. After Friday's Liberal rally in Bolton, Ontario was cancelled over crowd security concerns, Sunday's event in Cambridge saw his buses blocked by another angry crowd. Some people shouted death threats, and one man yelled racist and misogynist insults to a Black officer and a female officer in Trudeau's security detail. The scene caused an hour-long delay to his first big climate announcement of his re-election bid. Trudeau says he understands the fear and anxiety many are feeling amid a rapidly changing world, a pandemic and a tough year, but he will keep moving Canada forward. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and N-D-P Leader Jagmeet Singh have both condemned the angry crowds and called on people to be respectful.

"2021-09-01","Full text: Climate change has thrown the city a curve ball again with several major weather incidents causing a crowding at the plate on the second quarter bottom line. Storm activity this year caused the city-owned Nelson Hydro budget to rise slightly ahead of where it should be at this time of the year, noted city deputy financial officer Chris Jury, but it was also aided and abetted by an increase in the storm repair budget. He said the utility was first hit in 2021 with a storm on Jan. 13, causing significant damage to Hydro infrastructure. In response, an increase of $290,000 to the storm repair budget was approved by council, he explained in the Finance department second quarter financial update to city council recently. Three months later on April 18, the Nelson area suffered another intense windstorm event “which lead to further widespread power outages.” As a result, the city and Nelson Hydro are preparing to table its budget earlier this year in order to build in some cushion in the budget to allow for the increasing frequency of destructive major storms hitting the Nelson area, said Jury. With that storm activity and the trend line that is happening, not just here but all over the world, is the city putting enough into that budget line to have the best-case, worst-case covered, asked Coun. Jesse Woodward during the last regular council business meeting. “It just seems like to bet on instability is a good bet,” he said. It is something the city will need to take a deeper look at, Jury replied. “It’s so difficult to budget for a storm,” he said. “You might have a year with nothing, when other times you will have too much and go way over (budget).” He suggested the city might want to create a storm reserve fund as climate change keeps stirring the weather pot and throwing more severe storms into the mix. “In the past (storms) weren’t such an issue, but now it just seems to be quite obvious when you don’t budget for it,” said Jury. Revenues The rest of the second quarter report was uneventful for the city’s bottom line, a fresh breath after the blast of financial turmoil from the COVID-19 pandemic. Jury said city sales of service has rebounded substantially from a COVID-19-impacted 2020. “Significant drivers are a $175,000 increase in parking and parkade income, $27,000 in additional campground revenues, and $24,000 more from the Youth Centre when compared to last year,” he said. “We also have the first full year of the Farmers Market which bought in $11,000 of new revenue to the end of June. Some areas such as parking and the campground were slow to ramp back up, however, and are down slightly from 2019.” City investment income is down noticeably from 2020, Jury pointed out, with “prior year investment income stemmed largely from unrealized capital gains in bond investments” as the interest rates fell during the pandemic. “With interest rates expected to stay low for the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that the interest revenue from the bond portfolio and operating bank account will continue to be lower throughout the year,” he said in his report. • Transit revenues are ahead of 2020 after seeing a significant decline as a result of the drop in ridership due to COVID-19 last year. Expenses Overall, the city is managing its operating budget expenses as it predicted, said Jury. • General government is in line with the prior year, with the by-election costs and an additional FortisBC grant funded staff member — working on the embodied carbon project — being some of the factors why expenses are higher this year. “It is important to note that the main reason the budget is much higher this year ($3.6 million) is due to the COVID-19 restart grant funds being added in order to be available to fund any related expenses the city may incur this year,” said Jury. Environmental health services expenses are higher with the addition of one employee to the resource recovery truck team of two. But, with the switch from the blue bags to the blue bins the city has collected 41 per cent more in recycling product by weight, while garbage weight is five per cent higher over the same period last year. “This increase in recycling volume is creating a challenge for staff to pick up all the material during a regular work day, resulting in additional overtime costs,” said Jury. “A complete review of the city's environmental health services program is needed to understand how to handle this additional volume, as well as incorporate organics collection in the future.” • Recreation and cultural services are in line with the prior year and below budget, said Jury. The 2020 budget was reduced during the pandemic, so some areas such as the campground and parks maintenance were increased again for 2021. Capital • Implementation of the sidewalk upgrades and pavement resurfacing program is ongoing throughout the city; • the paving of the Lakeside waterfront pathway is scheduled for September; • the new Nelson Public Library building grant application was unsuccessful; • no announcement yet on the city's Low Carbon Heritage Renewal for the Nelson Civic Centre grant application; • staff have held off on purchasing one of the scheduled pick-up trucks and the used cargo van with the understanding that an electric version may be available in 2022; • in September work on the grant-funded Cottonwood washroom will commence; • work continues on the Daybreak Rotary lead phase two of their Rosemont playground project, with preparation of the new slide in process.

"2021-09-01","Full text: Manitoba premier comments on his political career WINNIPEG - Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister has said that he plans to step down Wednesday. Here are some quotes from an interview with The Canadian Press: On low polling numbers: ""If you govern with a view that you wish to be popular every day for four years so you can win the next election, you will not get much done ... and what we have done is a lot."""
"2021-09-01","Full text: Manitoba premier to step down Wednesday WINNIPEG - Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister plans to leave office Wednesday and have the Tory caucus choose an interim leader. Pallister, who announced his intention to step down earlier this month, said he has decided to leave well before the Progressive Conservative leadership vote Oct. 30. Part of the reason, he says, is a desire to ensure the race does not become divisive. ""The dangers of not leaving (this week) are that false allegations will be made about me trying to influence the outcome (of the leadership vote),"" Pallister said in an interview with The Canadian Press. ""And I have not, in any way, shape or form,"" he said. ""I have only spoken two weeks ago to my cabinet and caucus and said, 'I will be neutral. I wish you well. I would encourage you to make sure that this is a contest among friends.'"" So far, former health minister Heather Stefanson, former member of Parliament Shelly Glover and Tory backbencher Shannon Martin have announced plans to run for leader. In a wide-ranging interview about his political career, Pallister indicated regret over some of his government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, but expressed optimism that the party will rebound from low polling numbers. Pallister became leader in 2012 and quickly built up memberships and donations. Four years later, he took the party from the opposition benches to the largest majority government in a century. The Tories were re-elected in 2019. Never one to avoid confrontation, he froze wages of public-sector workers, cancelled a planned payment to the Manitoba Métis Federation for its support of hydroelectric projects, and butted heads with the board at Manitoba Hydro until members resigned en masse. Pallister offered an anecdote to explain his approach to politics. He said he went to a voter's home in 1992 and found a man in a chair who said he was content to stay on welfare and not look for work. ""'Now I've answered your questions, what are you going to do for me?''' Pallister recalled the man saying. ""I said, 'If you can stand up, I'll kick you in the ass, and get (expletive) out the door and go look for a job."" ""'He says, 'I'm not voting for you.' And I said, 'I'm not after the lazy vote, and if I've got to buy your vote, keep it.' ""And I've lived by that."" Pallister's achievements include a cut to the province's sales tax and a brief end to a decade of deficits. Then the pandemic hit, which resulted in more red ink — and a drop in opinion polls. The government placed restrictions on public gatherings and forced some businesses to close, but at times resisted calls from physicians for tougher measures. Case numbers spiked in the second and third waves. Manitoba sent dozens of intensive care patients to other provinces and has to date recorded the second-highest per-capita death rate from COVID-19 behind Quebec. Pallister said he rued lifting restrictions when certain vaccination or case-count targets were met, only to have to reimplement them as numbers grew again and the more-transmissible Delta variant emerged. ""The problem is the (targets) weren't high enough, and that's the regret,"" said Pallister, adding there was pressure in caucus. ""I'm probably, let's just say, more cautious than most of my colleagues on this stuff."" In early August, Pallister apologized for comments he made after two statues on the legislature grounds were toppled in protest over the deaths of indigenous children in residential schools. The premier said people who came to Canada did not come to destroy but to build, and Indigenous leaders criticized him for downplaying the harmful effects of the schools. Pallister also ran into criticism for his plan to eliminate elected school boards. Some people eyeing a leadership run have said they won't go ahead with that. Opinion polls in recent months suggest Tory support has plummeted, but Pallister said he's not deterred by polls two years out from the next election. ""If you're worried about being popular all the time, you might back away from challenging decisions on major public policy issues."" Tory fortunes are in a good position to rebound along with the post-pandemic economy, he suggested. Before the pandemic, Manitoba had stronger growth in private-sector capital investment than most provinces, provincial statistics show. Statistics Canada data indicates average weekly earnings have increased from a year ago, despite COVID-19. Pallister also points to the fiscal turnaround as a major accomplishment. Two bond rating agencies had lowered Manitoba's credit rating after years of deficits under the former NDP government. Ratings have since stabilized. The premier admitted to weakness on the communications front. Looking back, he said, he could have done a better job getting people on board before announcing changes to education, health care and other programs. ""We have to do a better job of getting third-party support."" Pallister plans to stay on as a legislature member for a short time. Once he's fully retired, he wants to return to financial planning, spend more time with family and exercise more. ""I'm really looking forward to getting fit again ... and when you're 67, you've got to work at it."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 29, 2021.

"2021-09-01","Full text: Angry crowd hurls profanity at Trudeau event OTTAWA - An angry crowd of agitators surrounded Justin Trudeau's campaign buses and screamed profanity at the Liberal Leader during a campaign event in Cambridge, Ont., Sunday. The event was delayed more than hour as the throng of people blocked the entrance to the local sheet metal business where Trudeau made the first big climate announcement of his re-election effort. It also comes two days after a Trudeau rally in Bolton, Ont., was cancelled over security concerns from another angry crowd. Trudeau says he understands that the pandemic has increased the fear and anxiety in many, but condemned any threats or use of violence, racism and bigotry. He says people who deny science around vaccines and climate change are not the ones who are going to dictate how Canada moves forward, and the events of this campaign are deepening his resolve to push forward with his platform. But he was at times difficult to hear over the crowd, which repeatedly chanted expletive-filled slogans aimed at the Liberal leader and carried signs at least one of which included a photo of Trudeau about to be executed by hanging. ""I do think we need to understand that people have had a tough year, that the world is changing rapidly, that there is fear, there is anxiety out there,"" Trudeau said. ""But let me be also very, very clear, I am absolutely resolute in my conviction to continue to move Canada forward. And that's the choice people get to make in this election."" One of the crowd members hurled a racist slur at a Black officer in Trudeau's security detail and a misogynist insult at a female officer. Others were heard shouting death threats. Police physically carried one woman off the private property when she refused to move back. Trudeau's campaign has been faltering thus far, with polls suggesting the significant lead the Liberals held earlier this year has evaporated. His campaign has been dogged by protesters at multiple stops, but the mob mentality and size of the crowds appear to have increased in recent days. Some of the agitators have appeared at multiple events. One man showed up at a Trudeau event in Hamilton, Ont., and then the next day at one in Surrey, B.C. He told reporters he was ""maybe"" being paid to follow Trudeau around. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh have both condemned the angry crowds and called on people to be respectful. O'Toole also said four Conservative campaign volunteers who showed up in the crowd at the Bolton rally have been told they're no longer welcome to campaign with the Tories. Their events were both far calmer than the Liberals' tour stop Sunday. O'Toole was in Saint-Hyacinthe, Que., where he promised new measures to help support small businesses trying to rebuild after the COVID-19 pandemic. The promises include a 25 per cent tax cut for individuals who invest up to $100,000 of their own money in a small business, and interest-free loans of up to $200,000 for small and mid-sized businesses from the government. Singh was also in Quebec taking questions with Ruth Ellen Brosseau, a former NDP MP who announced Friday she is seeking to take back her seat in Berthier — Maskinongé, northeast of Montreal. Trudeau's climate promise included plans to regulate total emissions cuts in the oil and gas sector for the first time, with a view to getting to net-zero by 2050, and setting new regulations that will require half of all cars sold in Canada to be zero-emission by 2030, and 100 per cent by 2035.

"2021-08-31","Full text: A proposed location for a new internet tower saw some opposition voiced at the Bashaw town council’s Aug. 19 regular meeting. Coun. Darren Pearson requested the subject of a proposed communications tower be discussed; he said he got an email from the Bashaw Ag Society that included several statements opposed to a location near the Ag Society for a new internet tower. However, Pearson stated he didn’t know what this was regarding. Town Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Theresa Fuller stated the subject had not yet come to council. She stated a business proposed to place a new internet tower on town-owned property near the Ag Society and she emailed the society to see what they thought of the placement. Pearson noted all of the responses he received were opposed to the tower’s proposed location. Fuller noted the town could see up to $6,000 in tax revenue from the tower every year if it’s placed and stated that revenue could be shared with the ag society if council wished. Coun. Rob McDonald added that it was good to see efforts to improve the internet and cell phone service in Bashaw. Councillors decided to discuss the issue at an upcoming regular council meeting. Cemetery memorial Councillors approved a request from a local family to place a bench in the Bashaw Cemetery in honour of their loved one. Fuller presented councillors with a letter from Kerri Docherty. “Although I recently moved from town I was born in Bashaw and will be buried in its beautiful cemetery, along with the many generations of my family already residing in their final resting places,” stated Docherty’s letter dated Aug. 13. “Sadly, my family and I have recently interred my daughter Amanda Aucoin in her place out there. “Her grandfather, Mike Aucoin, from Camrose County, has hoped to build and place a memorial bench in the cemetery as a place of honour. “The wood chosen is both yellow and red cedar. The finish will be many coats of laminate. No metal screws or nails will be used, only wood and glue. We are hoping to place the bench in an approved location along either the west or south fence.” Fuller stated trimming grass and weeds around the base of the bench was the only concern the town had about the request. She noted this request would be in addition to the plastic bench already there. Public Works Foreman Murray Holroyd stated he had no concerns with the request and councillors passed a resolution to approve placement of the bench under the supervision of the town staff. Public Works report Holroyd submitted his regular report, and noted in the parks department it is impossible for the department to keep up with the work load with the staff they have. He also noted one section of sidewalk has been repaired and another will be repaired soon near Heritage House. Holroyd also stated during his emergency management report that COVID numbers appear to be rising. “With rising numbers again, remaining cautious is the best plan currently,” he stated. Social centre lease Councillors approved sending a revised lease to the Bashaw Social Centre management board with the change that the board would be responsible for paying utility costs. Fuller stated in her report the facility is owned by the Town of Bashaw and leased to that group. “The lease was due for renewal and council had requested administration include provisions for the board to pay for water/sewer charges,” stated Fuller’s report. “Please note Bashaw Ag Society and Happy Gang Centre both pay for water, sewer and garbage services.” The revised agreement will be sent to the management board for their consideration. RCMP report Sgt. Bruce Holliday, NCO in charge of the Bashaw detachment, was on the meeting agenda as a delegation to present a report on 2021 first quarter police activity. However, Holliday cancelled. Councillors decided to table the presentation to a future meeting so they could discuss the report with Holliday.

"2021-08-31","Full text: Alberta CEO panel banging diversification drum CALGARY - Susannah Pierce's children aren't interested in following in her footsteps. The president of Shell Canada Ltd., one of Canada's largest integrated oil companies, heads up a workforce of 3,500 Canadian employees, earned public recognition as the face of the $40 billion LNG Canada project, and has lived and worked around the world. But Pierce's 15-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter don't see a future for themselves in the industry where their mother has thrived. The oil and gas sector is simply ""not as attractive as it once was"" to today's young people, Pierce says bluntly, an uncomfortable fact she and other energy executives are being forced to face up to — even within their own households. ""If the conversation isn’t, 'I want to work in the same business as you, Mom and Dad,' then we have to ask ourselves why,"" Pierce said in an interview. The dinnertime conversations between Pierce and her children are a scaled-down version of a wider discussion taking place in Alberta right now as an entire province tries to decide on its path forward. While Alberta's historic oil and gas sector still makes an outsized contribution to the Canadian economy, it has been battered and bruised by seven years of low prices, pipeline protests and cancellations, layoffs, and consolidation. The province's unemployment rate is 8.5 per cent, and close to 30 per cent of downtown Calgary's office market sits vacant. Alberta's long-term unemployment rate — the portion of the population that has been without work for more than a year — is 2.4 per cent, significantly higher than the national average of 1.4 per cent. Even now, with crude prices higher than they've been in years, there is widespread acknowledgment that the energy landscape has permanently shifted. Climate change and the transition away from fossil fuels have moved to the forefront of the national and international conversation. Investment dollars are increasingly flowing to industries with favourable environmental performance, and companies — Shell included — are investing in green technology and decarbonization as part of their own net-zero commitments. In the past several years, there have been various government attempts to address Alberta's challenges, from tax credits aimed at boosting the province's rapidly growing tech sector to incentives for petrochemical development and investments in hydrogen technology. Recently, a group of prominent Alberta CEOs — including Pierce — came together to form their own task force with the aim of coming up with long-term solutions for the Alberta economy. “It’s a service in support of what governments might be able to do, without asking governments to do it for us,” Pierce said. ""The world is changing, in terms of the energy product it needs. And as a result, we must change too."" The task force aims to come up with a series of economic strategies, policies and incentives that will attract investment and jobs to the province. It will also look at ways to keep young people in a province that is viewed by some as stuck in the past. Also involved in the project, dubbed ""Define the Decade,"" are other heavyweights like Enbridge's Al Monaco and Cenovus Energy's Alex Pourbaix. And the task force includes executives of some of the province's rapidly growing tech firms, such as artificial intelligence company AltaML and life sciences company DynaLIFE. Diversification has been a buzzword in Alberta during previous commodity price downturns. It has always fallen by the wayside, though, when oil prices start to climb again, said Adam Legge, president of the Business Council of Alberta. This time, however, it's different, he said, and there's no time to waste. ""Alberta's history of riding these boom and bust cycles ... is frankly, gone,"" Legge said. ""But we believe our best days are ahead of us. So many of the things that are happening In the world, the trends, the evolutions that are happening — Alberta really has a shot to be a global leader.” David Taras, a political analyst based at Calgary's Mount Royal University, said the idea of a group of Alberta's top CEOs joining together to lobby for diversification, green energy, and the startup economy would have been unfathomable 10 or even 5 years ago. The public relations message has clearly shifted away from defending traditional oil and gas, he said, to establishing Alberta's role in the public eye as a future-forward investment destination. “The global tide has shifted, and shifted dramatically,"" Taras said. ""And the industry has not only caught up, but realized they have to move on, they have to be in a different place."" The Calgary and Edmonton Chambers of Commerce are not involved in the ""Define the Decade"" initiative but recently released a joint wish list for the federal election that calls for commitments from all the parties with respect to diversifying Alberta's economy. Deborah Yedlin, president and chief executive of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, said the organization is asking for everything from federal investments in grants and equity deals to foster the growth of the startup tech sector, to the creation of national Centres of Excellence within Alberta for sectors ranging from clean technology, artificial intelligence, and sports. ""We (Alberta) have the willingness to lead, but we can't do it on our own,"" Yedlin said. ""We need federal support."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published August 29, 2021.

"2021-08-31","Full text: As Sundridge, Strong and Joly continue the search for a general practitioner, the chair of the Sundridge and District Medical Centre Committee is proposing an online guide to help residents without a family physician. Sundridge Coun. Steve Hicks has begun work on creating a virtual care centre that would list phone numbers for all health-related agencies spanning North Bay to Huntsville. “It would be an online repository like a phone book that lists all health services and we can also provide the links to go to their websites,” Hicks told fellow medical centre committee members. Once complete, the guide would be posted on the Village of Sundridge website. He's asked the committee members to come back with suggestions for the guide at the September committee meeting with the goal of getting it posted online by the end of September. Hicks has also asked committee members from Joly and Strong to run the idea by their respective councils in an effort to get the guide online in those two municipalities. The members liked the idea, including Strong Coun. Marianne Stickland, who said “we need an approach for people who get frustrated and point them in the right direction.” Hicks said putting health-related services online from North Bay to Huntsville doesn't resolve the doctor's shortage for the Sundridge area “but it could help a small number of people.” Hicks said the completed guide will have the same look for all three municipalities. He's also suggesting the three municipalities physically advertise on their respective websites that they are looking for a physician. He said it's possible a health practitioner could one day be online just browsing municipal sites and would see the recruitment notice. Hicks said there are at least two people who have expressed an interest in setting up a medical practice in the Sundridge area, but as yet the expression of interest hasn't become reality. Sundridge, Strong and Joly have only one physician and that's Dr. Sarah MacKinnon who works out of the Sundridge and District Medical Centre. The centre used to have two physicians until Dr. Peter Richard Zeindler closed his practice at the medical centre in July 2019. Strong Coun. Jason Cottrell, who also sits on the medical committee, says the search for a second physician has been going on for two years and there's still no luck finding a doctor who can help ease the patient load. Cottrell suggested considering Canada is in the middle of a federal election, perhaps the committee can ask each of the candidates running in the Parry Sound-Muskoka riding how their political party can resolve the local physician issue. Cottrell added now is also a good time for voters in the Sundridge region to voice their concerns to the candidates over the doctor shortage.

"2021-08-31","Full text: B.C. old-growth logging protest marks one year PORT RENFREW, B.C. - In the year since the first camp was set up to prevent old-growth logging around the Fairy Creek watershed on southern Vancouver Island, an expert in Canadian environmental movements says the protests have made a mark on politics and public discourse. Advocates have been calling for an end to old-growth logging in British Columbia for decades, but the issue flared again recently with more rallies, people speaking out and media attention, said David Tindall, a professor in the sociology department at the University of British Columbia. Tindall said he believes certain changes would not have happened without the ongoing blockades near Port Renfrew, B.C. He points to the speed of the B.C. government's decision to approve the request of three Vancouver Island First Nations to temporarily defer old-growth logging across about 2,000 hectares in the Fairy Creek and central Walbran areas, and to the federal Liberals' election pledge to establish a $50 million old-growth fund. Whether the public memory of the Fairy Creek protest persists over time — like the so-called War in the Woods over old-growth logging in Clayoquot Sound near Tofino in 1993 — could depend on the province taking action to set larger areas of old-growth forests aside from logging for good, Tindall said. ""I think if the provincial government just kind of makes some small-scale changes to plans and then continues business as usual, you know, two or five years from now, then (the protest) won't really be on the minds of people as Clayoquot was."" The recent flurry of arrests may also deter some people from joining the blockades, making it more difficult for the group to sustain its presence, Tindall added. Since May, the RCMP have enforced a court injunction granted to the Teal-Jones Group, the forestry company that holds the harvesting license in the area. The Mounties have said protesters' tactics include locking themselves into precarious structures above the ground and trenches dug into the road. The protests continued after the B.C. government approved the deferral request from thePacheedaht, Huu-ay-aht and Ditidaht First Nations in June. Kathy Code, a member of the protest group dubbed the Rainforest Flying Squad, said in an interview that parts of both deferred areas were already set aside through old-growth management and wildlife habitat areas. The same can be said of nine other areas temporarily deferred from logging by the province last year, she added. Research from Rachel Holt, Karen Price and Dave Daust — independent experts appointed in June to advise the province on old-growth management — shows that less than three per cent of the most productive old-growth remains across B.C. The deferral of logging in the most at-risk old-growth ecosystems is among the top recommendations in a report last year from an independent panel on old-growth management, which the B.C. government has pledged to fully implement. The No. 1 recommendation from that report was ""for government to engage with First Nation rights and titleholders and that's exactly what we're doing,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding it expects to announce additional deferrals soon. The Pacheedaht First Nation has signed a forest revenue-sharing agreement with the province and Chief Jeff Jones has asked the Fairy Creek protesters to leave, saying the nation is working on a resource stewardship plan that will guide forestry activities. The Teal-Jones Group said all harvesting and road-building in the deferred areas has been suspended and most of its work in the area involves second-growth forests. The protest group says its members are staying at Fairy Creek at the invitation of Pacheedaht elder Bill Jones and old-growth forests outside the deferred areas are still at risk of logging with road-building or cut blocks planned or already approved. The number of arrests since the RCMP began enforcing the injunction at Fairy Creek in May is over 800, similar to arrests made during the 1993 War in the Woods, one of thelargest acts of civil disobedience in recent Canadian history. Two years after the protests ended in Clayoquot Sound, the B.C. government changed its policies on clear-cutting forests. Code said protesters are staying put at Fairy Creek even though the RCMP have broken up their main kitchen, medical and communication stations. The protesters allege police have used excessive force, such as pepper-spraying people's faces at close range, shoving and throwing them to the ground, she said. The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP said as of Thursday, 21 of 91 complaints it has received about the conduct of police enforcement at Fairy Creek fall within its mandate and will be investigated. RCMP media relations officer Sgt. Chris Manseau said over email he cautions anyone viewing videos of recent arrests circulating online ""to keep in mind that they do not fully capture the events leading up to or following the interactions."" The injunction is set to expire on Sep. 26 and Teal Jones said it has applied for an extension, which the protest group is set to oppose. — by Brenna Owen in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 29, 2021.

"2021-08-30","Full text: People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier is on an East Coast tour, but because he chooses not to be vaccinated, is unable to campaign in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, or Prince Edward Island without following COVID-19 isolation rules. All three provinces require visitors to register ahead of time if travelling from outside the Atlantic Bubble (New Brunswick was effectively kicked out when it opened its borders to the rest of Canada earlier this year). Those travel rules require someone to self-isolate for eight to 14 days, depending on the province, if unvaccinated. “It’s very difficult to gather indoors in Quebec or in Ontario, but at least he can do rallies outdoors,” PPC spokesperson Martin Masse told Canada’s National Observer. “But he can’t even go to P.E.I., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland because of their restrictions (and) the risk of being arrested again, as he was in Manitoba. “This is very unfortunate, and is another curtailment of our democratic rights, for no rational health reasons at all.” Instead, Bernier is spending the weekend touring New Brunswick, a jurisdiction University of Prince Edward Island political science professor Don Desserud suggests is more fertile territory for the PPC. “With the People's Alliance, and before them the CoR, there is more of that kind of right-wing group in the Fredericton-Saint John River Valley area,” Desserud said. “(Bernier) may decide to use this as an example of how these PEI Passes, and the extension of those — the vaccine passports — are an infringement on liberty … but I doubt he'd get much sympathy on the island.” PEI Passes are what the province calls its proof of vaccination that allows people to enter without isolating. Vaccine passports have become a wedge issue in the federal election campaign. On Friday, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau pledged a re-elected Liberal government would create a $1-billion proof of vaccination fund to help provinces and territories set up their own credential system. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has also called for vaccine passports to be implemented nationally. “Real leadership — and not just talk — would mean getting more provinces to sign on to a vaccine passport, and ensure the passport is in place by Labour Day,” he said in a statement last week. Meanwhile, Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole has come out against mandatory vaccine mandates for federal workers and travellers, opting instead for rapid testing, and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet has signalled support for vaccine passports for international travel. Green Party Leader Annamie Paul has voiced support for Canadians getting vaccinated, but questioned a strategy of mandatory vaccinations. “Every person in Canada who is eligible to be vaccinated should do so as soon as possible,” Paul said in a statement last week. “However, we know that there are people who are unable to get vaccinated for legitimate reasons, whether those be medical conditions, religious or cultural convictions, or that live in rural communities with limited access to either vaccination clinics or information that addresses their concerns. What accommodations will be made for them?” On the campaign trail, Desserud said it’s been made clear in provincial pandemic elections that things will look different from pre-COVID votes. Door-knocking, crowded rallies, or even meet and greets are less common. And it’s not just for public health reasons, it’s optics too. “I think anyone who was overly aggressive in ignoring those restrictions, that would backfire on them,” he said. “There's a check in the system already where (politicians) are going to have to be careful, otherwise they're going to be perceived as being careless and not really taking this seriously.” But Bernier is no typical politician. The PPC leader was arrested in June for violating Manitoba’s requirement to self-isolate after entering the province. The PPC put out a statement at the time that said the arrest violated Bernier’s constitutional rights. “This isn’t about COVID anymore. It’s political repression,” Masse said in a statement at the time. Desserud said when Bernier was arrested, he “must’ve known” it was going to happen, but that he is likely to use these moments to his advantage. “(Bernier’s) not trying to be a broad base appeal politician, he's given up on that … but he wants to shore up that base of people who … see this as an incredible imposition on his liberty, on all of our liberties I suppose,” he said. “I can imagine him being well aware of what the value would be if he was turned away and couldn't enter a public arena, or something like that. So interesting to see how he plays it.” Subject: Leadership; Vaccines; Arrests; Immunization; COVID-19"
"2021-08-30","Full text: ​​The federal watchdog that holds RCMP to account has received a total of 91 public complaints associated with police enforcement measures at the Fairy Creek old-growth logging blockades in British Columbia. Of the total complaints received as of Wednesday, 21 fall within the mandate of the independent investigation agency, the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (CRCC) confirmed in an email on Thursday. The complaints cover a range of allegations including excessive use of force, refusal of medical attention, improper arrest, lack of police identification and wearing the “thin blue line” emblem, the mishandling of personal belongings, improper enforcement of exclusion zones and inappropriate handling of protesters, legal observers and the media, the CRCC said. News of the complaints comes days after multiple internet videos surfaced showing RCMP using pepper spray against Fairy Creek old-growth protesters during a confrontation over the weekend in the Port Renfrew region. And as a result, B.C.’s NDP government is taking fire from civil rights advocates while federal counterparts are calling for a public inquiry into police actions. RCMP tactics and the use of force are increasingly aggressive, according to activists involved in the year-long civil disobedience movement in the Port Renfrew region, said lawyer Phil Dwyer, who represents three individuals named in the court injunction filed by Teal-Jones logging company. The police are not using reasonable force and are reaching beyond the scope of what is required to fulfil their duties to enforce the injunction, he said, adding doing so increases the risks for everyone involved. “Considering what I’ve seen in video and from conversations with people on the ground, it’s not surprising that this many complaints would have arisen,” Dwyer said. “And given the fullness of time, I expect there will only be more filed.” Several online videos detail the confrontation between officers and protesters on a logging road on Saturday. In one longer video, officers can be seen shooting multiple canisters of pepper spray at close range onto a huddle of protesters who had refused to disperse and had locked arms to make their arrests more difficult. The premier and the public safety minister need to rein in the RCMP who are using unreasonable force against protesters, many of whom are Indigenous on unceded territory with inherent rights to protect the land, said Veronica Martisius, staff counsel with the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA). “The silence from (Premier) John Horgan and (Minister) Mike Farnworth is deafening,” Martisius said, noting the province has contracted the federal force to police municipalities in B.C. “When RCMP are acting unlawfully, the province should be stepping in,” Martisius said, adding officers still have a responsibility to maintain public safety while enforcing injunctions. “Police don’t have carte blanche to do whatever they want. Their power is limited when it comes to respecting civil liberties and human rights, otherwise we’d be living in a police state.” The Rainforest Flying Squad, the coalition organizing protesters, alleges police are using excessive and increasing force when making arrests, as well as operating heavy equipment and chainsaws dangerously close to protesters to extract them from the obstacles designed to frustrate arrests. One 35-year-old protester was flown by helicopter to hospital in Victoria on Saturday with neck injuries after a forceful arrest, while others have suffered a sprained ankle, a broken rib, or cuts and bruises during arrests, said RFS in a statement. The protests and protection of old-growth is cropping up as a hot-button issue in the federal election, with the Liberals pledging to do more to protect ancient forests, and members of the federal NDP calling for an investigation into police actions at Fairy Creek. NDP MP Jack Harris, with the backing of Vancouver Island incumbent candidates Alistair MacGregor and Laurel Collins, called on Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to launch a full and independent investigation into RCMP actions at Fairy Creek. The violent actions of RCMP at Fairy Creek are unacceptable and only escalate the situation, wrote MacGregor, who is running for re-election in the Cowichan-Malahat-Langford riding, on social media. “We have written to Minister Blair calling for full federal review of the situation and police actions, and we are committed to more robust and independent civilian oversight of the RCMP,” he tweeted. On Monday, hundreds of people gathered outside RCMP detachments in Victoria and other municipalities to call for the RCMP to stand down at Fairy Creek. RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Chris Manseau said protesters failed to follow officers’ directions during Saturday’s confrontation, which he said left one officer with a concussion after he was knocked over in the scuffle. “We really need to remember that it’s the actions of the protesters that dictate the actions of the police,” Manseau said Tuesday. “When crowds are failing to follow police direction, one thing does lead to another. “In order to gain compliance from that large crowd of people … it took the use of pepper spray, and then the crowd followed police direction after that.” A lot of the video snippets online do not illustrate the full context of the situation, Manseau said. “There's lots of examples of peaceful, lawful, and safe protests that are occurring, even after the incident on the weekend,” he said. The RCMP cannot speak to the number of complaints made to CRCC, as it is an independent body that investigates the federal police force, Manseau said, adding he advises anyone who felt they were wronged or injured to reach out to the commission. Regardless of any potential public inquiry, RCMP will likely do an internal review of enforcement measures at Fairy Creek, Manseau said. “With enforcement actions like this, especially one that’s so large, I’m sure there will be a review,” he said. “And there are things to learn from it, and to have better practices in the future. We absolutely support that.” As to the commission's complaint process, the RCMP investigate the allegation and then issue a final report to the individual who filed the complaint, CRCC said. But if the complainant isn’t satisfied with the RCMP’s final report, they can request the CRCC independently review the investigation of the public complaint. Police need to take immediate action to respect the limits of their powers and act within the confines of the law when arresting people, said Martisius, but RCMP in the videos are taking heavy-handed measures against non-combative protesters. “Of course, there are folks who are engaged in civil disobedience, but that doesn't give the right to the RCMP to act violently towards those people,” she said, adding a recent court decision made it clear officers must safely arrest and remove people. “They still have a duty to protect the public.” Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer UPDATE: August 26, 2021, 02:50 p.m."

"2021-08-29","Full text: A Manitoba First Nations Chief says that if candidates in the upcoming federal election really want to help First Nations communities deal with mental health issues, they need to truly understand, and they need to make sure more Canadians understand the history behind what so many Indigenous communities and people have actually been through. “You always hear the politicians and the candidates trotting out that term reconciliation and that’s great, but in terms of mental health and overall health services reconciliation is really about healing,” Keeseekoowenin Ojibway Nation Chief Norman Bone said on Friday. “There is so much healing that needs to happen in these communities, and we can’t have that unless we really understand what the hell happened.” On Thursday federal Conservative leader Erin O’Toole announced that if the Conservatives were elected to lead they would invest billions into mental health services and programs in the country. As part of the pledge, O’Toole said the Conservatives would invest $1 billion in new funding over five years for First Nations, Métis and Inuit mental health and drug treatment programs, and work to support land-based and culturally appropriate mental health care. As Chief of Keeseekoowenin Ojibway Nation, Bone leads a community of about 500 residents that sits 100 kilometres north of Brandon. Bone said that no matter what treatments or services are available in First Nations communities, he does not believe that healing and improved mental health can be achieved unless whoever is leading this country invests time and energy into educating Canadians and themselves about the true history of Indigenous people in Canada. “The candidates really need to do some work on promising that they will give all of us a good history lesson going right back from the treaties, to the residential schools, and up to now, because you can’t fix things if you don’t know what happened in the first place,” Bone said. “You can’t fix something if you don’t know what is broken in the first place.” Whoever is elected to lead in the upcoming election, Bone said one of the first things they need to do is sit down face-to-face with Indigenous leaders and governments and spend as much time as it takes to communicate that history and how it has effected and continues to effect Indigenous people throughout generations. “All I hear from so many politicians is the term reconciliation and they’ve turned it into a catch phrase, but it’s not very often they actually give you the details of what they know and what they’re going to do with that knowledge,” Bone said. “What we would need to see right away is a meeting between the federal government and Indigenous leadership, but not just a short meeting. There needs to be a real discussion nation to nation and government to government where we need to put the work in to get that education.” — Dave Baxter is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the Winnipeg Sun.

"2021-08-29","Full text: Administration will continue to explore current and supplemental funding sources for the Spray Park Shades Project. Council requested that if by Dec. 1, 2021, no supplemental source has been found, up to $20,000 will be utilized from the Parks and Trails Major Reserve. The budget allocated for this project is $40,000 and it is incorporated in the 5-year capital plan. Administration anticipated $25,000 for the 2021 shade project to come from Harry Collinge High School’s Prom Legacy Committee. The Legacy Committee indicated their will to contribute to the project in 2020 but the contribution has not been confirmed and the committee has not reached an internal decision yet. Administration has not found any other grants that the municipality would be eligible for at this time and for this project. Council discussed postponing or carrying the project to 2022 to allow for administration to secure funds and order materials. Hans van Klaveren, Hinton’s manager of parks, recreation, and culture, said it would take seven to eight weeks for materials to arrive from the time they are ordered. This means it is likely not feasible to get the shades installed in 2021. Laura Howarth, acting CAO at the Aug. 24 council meeting, noted that if council chose to postpone the project and the capital budget doesn’t get approved until spring in 2022, the building season next year would again be lost. The intent would be to get the project in the queue with an approved budget to start tendering in the winter and building in the spring prior to summer when the shades would be utilized, she said. “I really do think that little kids, older people, moms and dads, their health and welfare, we certainly do have to consider,” said Coun. JoAnn Race. Mayor Marcel Michaels noted that if council postpones the project, they would risk not having it constructed prior to next summer. “The intent is to make sure that this does move forward but with minimal risk to the organization and minimal cost,” said Coun. Albert Ostashek. Any incomplete capital project at the end of the financial year will carry forward without any further action by council, noted Rob Osmond, Hinton’s project support of corporate services. Without direction to postpone or carry forward, administration is able to continue working on the project and start construction as soon as funding is available. Due to the upcoming election and a possible changeover of council, council made a direction to continue seeking additional and current funding sources for construction in 2022. “Ultimately, I look at a lot of the community groups, if they have cash sitting there for a project, they’ll either say yes or it will go to another really important project in the community. It’s not just wasted,” said Coun. Dewly Nelson. As soon as funding is secured, administration can go ahead with the next steps in making the shades project a reality. Coun. Trevor Haas asked if council would have any input in the future design of the shades, given the images and examples included in the report. Michaels said there would not be another discussion around this project, but if council has an appetite to have any input they would need to put in a request for decision around the design at a future date. Howarth said administration would explore what features would fit within the design standards. The option to have a shade structure commissioned locally has been brought forward by the legacy committee representative. The original design of the Rotary Spray and Play Park included one shade structure in the style of a shelter or gazebo cover, but was removed due to budget restraints. Instead, trees were planted to provide shade but they did not mature to offer significant shade for visitors. In 2017, an Alberta Prevents Cancer initiative resulted in a draft proposal that could finance, through supplied grant funding, the purchase of shade structures for the park. Expenses for the installation and in-ground foundational work associated with the design were too complex and in the end, funding could not be secured. The shade installation project did not make the capital budget shortlist during the budget process in the following two years. The Legacy Committee indicated their will to donate the remainder of their legacy fund in 2020 to the shades project, after discontinuing this group and closing its financial books.

"2021-08-29","Full text: CIBC defends banking after Trudeau tax proposal TORONTO - CIBC's chief executive offered an impassioned defence of Canada's banking sector the day after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau made a campaign pledge to raise the tax rate for the industry. ""Banks have always been in the crosshairs, but what you want is a healthy banking system,"" Victor Dodig said during a conference call Thursday to discuss the bank's quarterly earnings. ""A healthy banking system helps the economy grow,"" . Dodig said he would not comment on specific election promises but wanted to reminded investors of the work banks did during the early days of the outbreak, when they distributed pandemic stimulus funds and deferred on loans for clients. He also noted that most Canadians benefit either directly or indirectly from the dividends and economic growth of the banks. It's important that the government policies not discourage foreign investment, said Dodig. ""My great hope is that you don't have intervention in any particular industry sector, because that doesn't actually attract foreign capital. We need capital and we need people to come to Canada to make the country stronger and to make the country better."" On Wednesday, Trudeau proposed raising the corporate income tax rate by three percentage points on banks and insurance companies with earnings over $1 billion, which he said had come into ""windfall"" profits because of economic stimulus measures from the government. The proposal also includes establishing an unspecified ""recovery dividend"" for the two industries that would last four years, which together with the tax increase would bring in at least $2.5 billion a year. ""This week, Canada's biggest banks are posting their latest massive profits of billions of dollars ... so as we rebuild, we're going to ask big financial institutions to pay a little back,"" Trudeau said. CIBC reported earnings of $1.73 billion or $3.76 per diluted share for the quarter ended July 31, up from $1.17 billion or $2.55 per diluted share a year earlier. The increase came as CIBC reported a $99-million reversal of credit losses for its latest quarter compared with a provision for credit losses of $525 million in the same quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, CIBC says it earned $3.93 per diluted share, up from an adjusted profit of $2.71 per diluted share a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected the bank to earn $3.41 per share, according to financial market data firm Refinitiv. On Thursday, CIBC also announced a commitment to reach net zero emissions associated with its operational and financing activities by 2050, and increased its sustainable finance target to $300 billion by 2030. Dodig said the bank had already ramped up funding on renewable energy projects, now ranked third for North American renewable energy financing for the first half of this year, up from 26th place in 2016. CIBC will also set up interim targets to reduce the emissions that it helps finance, and will begin reporting on their progress starting next fiscal year, said Dodig. ""The transition to a low-carbon global economy will take meaningful commitment and it's going to take action from everyone,"" he said. CIBC said its Canadian personal and business banking earned $642 million for the third quarter, up from $457 million a year ago, helped by lower provisions for credit losses and higher revenue, partially offset by higher expenses. Canadian commercial banking and wealth management reported a profit of $470 million for the quarter compared with $320 million in the same quarter last year, while CIBC's U.S. commercial banking and wealth management operations earned $266 million, up from a profit of $60 million a year ago. CIBC's capital markets business reported net income of $491 million for the third quarter, up from $443 million in the same quarter last year.

"2021-08-29","Full text: Calling Province out on all-call paramedics The RDCK’s chair and top staff have asked to meet with BC Emergency Health Services officials to talk about how on-call pay policies for paramedics are causing critical staff shortages in rural and remote communities. “We do know that certain communities, including Kaslo, New Denver and Salmo, are severely lacking in staffing,” said RDCK Chair and Area D Director Aimee Watson. She said the provincial policy of hiring staff and paying them $2/hour to be on call is not attracting the staff they need. “You cannot staff a unit that way,” said Watson. “We know in Kaslo/Area D there’s been dark days when there’s been no services available, and it’s only pure luck that no one’s been called out.” New Denver also has the same problem, with only one emergency responder on staff, she noted. “It was last week, from Edgewood to Winlaw, we had one car available,” noted Director Colin Moss of New Denver. “And this is at the height of adventure tourism season. It’s just ridiculous and needs addressing promptly.” A letter is going out to officials, while Watson collects notes from other directors about the problem to bring to the meeting. New motion on old growth Regional directors are calling on the Province to do more to protect old-growth forests within RDCK boundaries. Area E Director Ramona Faust presented a motion to the board requesting that old-growth and significant old trees “are preserved, and forest revitalization is focused on ecosystem restoration, scientifically defensible wildfire risk reduction, moisture retention, and surface water quality for which the region relies upon for drinking water as well as agricultural and commercial use.” The motion prompted some debate on defining old growth, how the motion would apply to public vs. private lands, and what was trying to be accomplished with the motion. “We are in effect challenging FLNROD’s and BC Forests’ strict adherence to seeing forests strictly as lumber plantations,” said Director Leah Main, in support of the motion. “We are asking for a bigger look at what the values in a forest are.” Pile-on for conservation A proposal to create a conservation fund to finance environmental projects in the Slocan Valley got a lot bigger during discussion by RDCK directors. Director Walter Popoff moved that staff be asked to look into setting up a Local Conservation Fund service for Area H. It would establish a parcel tax, raising money from property owners for conservation projects to be managed by the Kootenay Conservation Program (KCP). A similar service is operated by the RDCK for North Kootenay Lake and the West Arm – Areas A, D, and E. Residents there pay $15 per parcel in a line item on their taxes annually to fund conservation of water quality and aquatic ecosystems around the lake. In the last four years, the tax has raised $400,000 for such projects, which has been used as leverage to get triple that amount in matching funding. However, Popoff’s motion for Area H was amended to include Area I, at the request of Director Andy Davidoff. Then other directors chimed in – with areas B, C, F, G and J all saying they also wanted to be included in the new fund if possible. Staff are now going to research what it would take to create the service for these areas – now about half the area of the RDCK – and bring a report back to the board. Voters will still have a chance to say ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ to the proposal, as the establishment of new services have to be approved by taxpayers. That could happen as a stand-alone referendum or as a side vote during the next general election of the board. Resource Recovery Plan adopted It just needs a little more consultation and the Regional District’s plan to reduce waste and promote recycling is going to the Province. The new plan updates the 10-year-old document for managing waste and recyclables in the West Kootenay, and reflects the changes in policy over the last decade, especially when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions created by organic waste. To address that issue, the RDCK will be constructing two composting facilities in 2021, and Castlegar, Creston and Nelson will begin curbside collection of organics in 2022. The plan for the next ten years includes: increasing awareness of waste reduction and recycling; reducing organic waste going to landfills; securing more land for waste deposit and meeting tougher regulatory standards; completing the closure of legacy landfill dumps; establishing a ‘fair and sustainable’ cost recovery system that incentivizes waste reduction and reuse."

The co-owner of Sunnyside Cafe in Esquimalt, Stephanie Herring, says she believes it's a privacy violation to ask customers for their vaccination status and she won't put staff in a position that could lead to confrontation while enforcing B-C's rules. Dave Puhky, co-owner of The Fitness Academy in Victoria, won't ask people to show their vaccine card, saying he doesn't want to add to the divisions he sees in society.

"2021-08-29","Full text: The West Kootenay’s rookie member of the legislature had a positive experience with her first appearance as a delegation to the RDCK board at its August meeting. Brittny Anderson, who was elected as the MLA for Nelson-Creston in last year’s provincial election, was there at the request of the board. The region’s other MLA, Katrine Conroy, was unable to attend. It was intended as a friendly meet-and-greet, but directors had beefs they wanted to raise with the NDP backbencher. The main topic was the board feeling that when they try to raise issues through proper channels – like the Union of BC Municipality resolution process – it only receives boilerplate answers in return. “We put a lot of work into our resolutions as a local government,” said Board Chair Aimee Watson. “But a majority of the time the responses we get are reiterating what we already know. “There’s no acknowledgement of the significant impact or that the local context is experiencing a very different experience – and provincially these regulations are not working, or whatever the context is.” That was the case with recent board resolutions on water systems management, ALR zoning, forestry, private land logging, and others, she said. “We’re feeling that it’s really not worth our time to do motions.” Anderson said she sometimes felt the same way when she was a Nelson City councillor, and said she would talk to the Minister of Municipal Affairs on the issue, and get back to the board. “Speaking with my colleagues who are MLAs in rural ridings, that is something we really want to work hard on, that rural ridings feel represented,” she said. “A lot of time something comes out of Victoria, and you say, ‘that really makes sense in an urban setting’ but in our rural setting it just doesn’t quite work in the same way. “But I want to work with all of you to push things forward.” The directors also raised issues like cell service, emergency response, and water shortages in rural Creston. They also praised Anderson for showing up for public meetings during the recent evacuation alerts and orders in her area, and for responding promptly to inquiries. Anderson said she does what she can, but also admitted that the pandemic has made learning her new job that much tougher. “I actually haven’t even met a lot of my other colleagues in person” because of COVID restrictions, she said. “So for me to try to figure out how to advocate for you, I’m still really in a learning process.” The board and MLA agreed to continue to keep in touch on issues.

"2021-08-29","Full text: ​​The federal watchdog that holds RCMP to account has received a total of 91 public complaints associated with police enforcement measures at the Fairy Creek old-growth logging blockades in British Columbia. Of the total complaints received as of Wednesday, 21 fall within the mandate of the independent investigation agency, the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (CRCC) confirmed in an email on Thursday. The complaints cover a range of allegations including excessive use of force, refusal of medical attention, improper arrest, lack of police identification and wearing the “thin blue line” emblem, the mishandling of personal belongings, improper enforcement of exclusion zones and inappropriate handling of protesters, legal observers and the media, the CRCC said. News of the complaints comes days after multiple internet videos surfaced showing RCMP using pepper spray against Fairy Creek old-growth protesters during a confrontation over the weekend in the Port Renfrew region. And as a result, B.C.’s NDP government is taking fire from civil rights advocates while federal counterparts are calling for a public inquiry into police actions. RCMP tactics and the use of force are increasingly aggressive, according to activists involved in the year-long civil disobedience movement in the Port Renfrew region, said lawyer Phil Dwyer, who represents three individuals named in the court injunction filed by Teal-Jones logging company. The police are not using reasonable force and are reaching beyond the scope of what is required to fulfil their duties to enforce the injunction, he said, adding doing so increases the risks for everyone involved. “Considering what I’ve seen in video and from conversations with people on the ground, it’s not surprising that this many complaints would have arisen,” Dwyer said. “And given the fullness of time, I expect there will only be more filed.” Several online videos detail the confrontation between officers and protesters on a logging road on Saturday. In one longer video, officers can be seen shooting multiple canisters of pepper spray at close range onto a huddle of protesters who had refused to disperse and had locked arms to make their arrests more difficult. The premier and the public safety minister need to rein in the RCMP who are using unreasonable force against protesters, many of whom are Indigenous on unceded territory with inherent rights to protect the land, said Veronica Martisius, staff counsel with the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA). “The silence from (Premier) John Horgan and (Minister) Mike Farnworth is deafening,” Martisius said, noting the province has contracted the federal force to police municipalities in B.C. “When RCMP are acting unlawfully, the province should be stepping in,” Martisius said, adding officers still have a responsibility to maintain public safety while enforcing injunctions. “Police don’t have carte blanche to do whatever they want. Their power is limited when it comes to respecting civil liberties and human rights, otherwise we’d be living in a police state.” The Rainforest Flying Squad, the coalition organizing protesters, alleges police are using excessive and increasing force when making arrests, as well as operating heavy equipment and chainsaws dangerously close to protesters to extract them from the obstacles designed to frustrate arrests. One 35-year-old protester was flown by helicopter to hospital in Victoria on Saturday with neck injuries after a forceful arrest, while others have suffered a sprained ankle, a broken rib, or cuts and bruises during arrests, said RFS in a statement. The protests and protection of old-growth is cropping up as a hot-button issue in the federal election, with the Liberals pledging to do more to protect ancient forests, and members of the federal NDP calling for an investigation into police actions at Fairy Creek. NDP MP Jack Harris, with the backing of Vancouver Island incumbent candidates Alistair MacGregor and Laurel Collins, called on Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to launch a full and independent investigation into RCMP actions at Fairy Creek. The violent actions of RCMP at Fairy Creek are unacceptable and only escalate the situation, wrote MacGregor, who is running for re-election in the Cowichan-Malahat-Langford riding, on social media. “We have written to Minister Blair calling for full federal review of the situation and police actions, and we are committed to more robust and independent civilian oversight of the RCMP,” he tweeted. On Monday, hundreds of people gathered outside RCMP detachments in Victoria and other municipalities to call for the RCMP to stand down at Fairy Creek. RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Chris Manseau said protesters failed to follow officers’ directions during Saturday’s confrontation, which he said left one officer with a concussion after he was knocked over in the scuffle. “We really need to remember that it’s the actions of the protesters that dictate the actions of the police,” Manseau said Tuesday. “When crowds are failing to follow police direction, one thing does lead to another. “In order to gain compliance from that large crowd of people … it took the use of pepper spray, and then the crowd followed police direction after that.” A lot of the video snippets online do not illustrate the full context of the situation, Manseau said. “There's lots of examples of peaceful, lawful, and safe protests that are occurring, even after the incident on the weekend,” he said. The RCMP cannot speak to the number of complaints made to CRCC, as it is an independent body that investigates the federal police force, Manseau said, adding he advises anyone who felt they were wronged or injured to reach out to the commission. Regardless of any potential public inquiry, RCMP will likely do an internal review of enforcement measures at Fairy Creek, Manseau said. “With enforcement actions like this, especially one that’s so large, I’m sure there will be a review,” he said. “And there are things to learn from it, and to have better practices in the future. We absolutely support that.” As to the commission's complaint investigations, once completed, the findings are turned over to the RCMP, which then issues a final report to the individual who filed the complaint, CRCC said. But If the complainant isn’t satisfied with the RCMP’s final findings, they can request the CRCC independently review the force’s investigation of the public complaint. Police need to take immediate action to respect the limits of their powers and act within the confines of the law when arresting people, said Martisius, but RCMP in the videos are taking heavy-handed measures against non-combative protesters. “Of course, there are folks who are engaged in civil disobedience, but that doesn't give the right to the RCMP to act violently towards those people,” she said, adding a recent court decision made it clear officers must safely arrest and remove people. “They still have a duty to protect the public.” Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer UPDATE: August 26, 2021, 02:50 p.m."

"2021-08-29","Full text: Afghanistan, pandemic cast a shadow over campaign OTTAWA - The crisis in Afghanistan — alongside the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic — has thrown up an alarming backdrop to the federal election, which could overshadow campaign efforts by Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau as his government's record comes under scrutiny. Party leaders hit the road last week just as the fourth wave began to surge and Kabul fell to the Taliban, prompting a desperate push to ramp up evacuation efforts for Canadian expats and former Afghan support staff at the capital's airport. That effort ended Thursday ahead of the United States' withdrawal deadline of Aug. 31. Trudeau has faced questions daily about the situation in Afghanistan, where Canada boarded some 3,700 Canadian nationals and Afghan refugees onto evacuation flights in recent weeks. Explosions near the Kabul airport Thursday again took attention away from the Liberal leader's campaign message about support for low-income seniors during a campaign stop in Quebec City. The Pentagon said two ISIS suicide bomberskilled at least 60Afghan civilians and 13 American service members. Trudeau called it a ""very difficult day"" but said Ottawa's commitment to resettle more than 20,000 Afghans in Canada and support residents in the war-torn region will continue.

"2021-08-29","Full text: Canadian stuck in Afghanistan worries she will die A Canadian woman stuck in Afghanistan with her parents says she's terrified she will die before she is able to return to her Ontario home and is blaming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Zak, who asked her full name not be revealed due to safety concerns, said Thursday the Canadian military appeared disorganized during evacuations from the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. The 50-year-old cried and said she is angry at Trudeau for turning his back on Canadian citizens in that country. ""How can he sleep at night (if) he knows that people have family left behind?"" she told The Canadian Press by phone. ""How can (the) Canadian government (say), 'We are the best country in the world,' (and turn) its back on its citizens? Could you ask him this question? Can someone ask him?"" Zak said she left her three grown children at home in Brampton, Ont., and went to Afghanistan in August to find safety for her parents as the Talibanwas taking over the country. She twice tried to leave before the American-led military mission's Aug. 31 deadline, she said, but was beaten by Taliban members and pushed away from the gates of the airport, where she had been told to meet Canadian officials to get a flight home. On Thursday, when the last of Canada's troops left the country, she tried again to get on a plane but was stopped by the Taliban, Zak said. The U.S. military co-ordinated with its citizens on safer locations to meet them, she said. ""The U.S. government is calling its citizens and they gave them a space to go. They go there and they pick them up from that spot, or they send them to the hotels. They pick them up from the hotels. ""There's many ways that the Canadian government can save its citizens, but they are not.""' Zak said she got a call at 3:40 a.m. from the Canadian government. ""They are like, 'Be at the gate by 6 a.m. and take food and water with you,'"" Zak said. ""When it's dark, it's not safe. But I did go there earlier."" Zak said she was also told to wear red so the military could find her at the gate, where she would be screened for admission. Taliban members were shooting guns and beating people near the gate, she said. She ran into other Canadian citizens and held onto her Canadian passport as she fell, injuring her head and knees. There were U.S. soldiers, but the Canadian military was nowhere in sight, said Zak, who added that she waited for awhile and then left. A few hours later, a bomb exploded where she had been waiting, she said. The blast killed 12 U.S. service members and at least 60 Afghan civilians. ""I saw so many kids there. I saw so many people and they're all dead now,"" Zak said through tears. ""I feel sorry for my people. These are good people with good heart. Every day now, you're just waiting death. It's a slow death for us."" Trudeau was asked about the bombing during the federal election campaign Thursday and said it was a ""very difficult day."" He added that Ottawa's is committed to resettling more than 20,000 Afghans in Canada. Canada boarded about 3,700 Canadian nationals and Afghan refugees onto evacuation flights in recent weeks. Zak's youngest daughter, Marjan, 25, said Trudeau should be ashamed. ""Trudeau was more interested in his election campaign and he's saying he's balancing both. But he's obviously not and you can tell,"" she said. ""They were like ... 'Get to the airport.' But how are you supposed to get to the airport when people are getting shot left, right and centre? There's no way to get in."" ""It might take a miracle for my mom to come home,"" said another daughter, Laila.

"2021-08-28","Full text: Halifax tenants worry about end to rent control HALIFAX - For Halifax residents like Matt Whalen, the looming end of pandemic-era rent control in Nova Scotia signals that even middle-class people will struggle to find affordable accommodation in the months to come. “I make a good salary, but rent is half of my gross income and it's only going up,” the digital marketing specialist said in a recent interview. “We're very quickly becoming a city that caters only to the wealthy.” For the 33-year-old, the bad news came in December, in the form of a two-page letter from the property manager of his unit. His landlord said that once the two per cent cap on rent hikes is lifted, his rent would rise by about $100 a month. Former Liberal premier Stephen McNeil set a two per cent cap on rent increases in November 2020. The cap was retroactive to September of that year and is set to expire in February 2022 or when the COVID-19 state of emergency in the province is lifted — whichever comes first. Whalen is one of many Nova Scotians raising concerns about the quick inflation of rent. Global News reported last week that one Halifax resident was informed the day after the Aug. 17 provincial election that rent on his two-bedroom would rise from $790 to $1,650 — a 109 per cent hike — once the rent increase cap is lifted. Whalen, meanwhile, was told by his landlord, POLYCORP, that the company had canvassed comparable buildings on the peninsula and found its units were “well below market rates."" Effective May 1, his rent would rise to $1,565 from $1,465, but in light of the rent cap, the increase would temporarily be about $30 a month. “They sent that during the height of the pandemic,” Whalen said. “One thing was just the callousness of the message and the timing was quite unfortunate, but then the other part was the clear disregard for the spirit of the legislation.” POLYCORP was not immediately available for comment. Rent control and housing have quickly become an issue during premier-designate Tim Houston's first week in office. The day after he was voted into power last week, protests broke out in Halifax against a police operation tasked with removing a series of homeless encampments. Halifax police said 24 people were arrested in connection with the protest. Houston told reporters earlier this week he didn’t believe in rent control as an answer to the larger housing issue in Nova Scotia. “The solution to a housing crisis is more housing,” Houston said. “I think there’s lots of ramifications of rent control that are actually not productive to adding housing stock.” Houston mentioned the Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission, which in its most recent report was also hesitant to call rent control a key strategy to address the housing crisis. The Commission said the cap on rent increases should be lifted in the time outlined by the province. It also recommended that when rent control ends, the government should offer temporary assistance to some low-income households. Tris Winfield, CEO of local real estate investment firm KKT Investments, echoed Houston’s point in a recent interview. “It's easy,"" Winfield said, “you build more, you raise the supply, you move the restrictions on supply. And as a result of more supply, well, you have more units being built.” “Guess what prices will be? Guess what rent will do? It will fall.” Rent control as a public policy has proven to be flawed, he added, causing enormous growth in demand but stifling growth in supply. “Because the landlord is going to have a greater selection, there's a much more competitive tenant situation with rent control, where the landlord has more choice,” Winfield said, adding that the policy negatively impacts lower-income tenants. There’s also the matter of the increased cost of property maintenance, said Kevin Russell, executive director of the Investment Property Owners Association of Nova Scotia. Property investors, he said in a recent interview, may be facing expense issues when it comes to maintenance. “Currently, the two per cent rent cap is in place. However, expenses are running at about four, four and a half per cent on an ongoing basis,” Russell said. “There's a lot of landlords struggling with the rent control in place as it is, so they're making decisions to put off capital investments into the property to upgrade the property.” Lisa Roberts, the federal NDP candidate for Halifax, said in an interview Thursday rent control is well-suited to address the city's housing woes. ""Investing in real estate doesn't necessarily result in more stock,"" Roberts said about property owners who buy old buildings, renovate them and increase rents. ""I feel sometimes that we're cutting off our nose to spite our face in protecting the interest of owners, not recognizing that there are costs to the economy."" Whalen said he has doubts whether more housing will solve the problem of unaffordable rent hikes for ordinary citizens. He said he suspects property managers may take the opportunity to charge “as much as the market will bear.” And he said he's not sure if he will remain in the apartment he currently lives in but hopes to stay on the peninsula if he can. ""That's where my friends and my life is,"" he said. ""I don't think I can stay even at a $100 (increase). It's not ideal, but there's there's no place to go right now.""

"2021-08-28","Full text: ​The federal agency that holds RCMP to account has received a total of 73 public complaints associated with enforcement measures at the Fairy Creek old-growth logging blockades in British Columbia, says the legal team representing the activist group. Counsel for the Rainforest Flying Squad (RFS) — the group behind the protests — received confirmation from the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (CRCC) about the number of complaints received as of Monday, said lawyer Phil Dwyer. To date, 17 complaints fall under the agency’s mandate and will be investigated, Dwyer said Wednesday afternoon. News of the complaints comes days after videos showing RCMP using pepper spray against Fairy Creek old-growth protesters during a confrontation over the weekend surfaced on the internet. And as a result, B.C.’s NDP government is taking fire from civil rights advocates while federal counterparts are calling for a public inquiry into police actions. RCMP tactics and the use of force are increasingly aggressive, according to activists involved in the year-long civil disobedience movement in the Port Renfrew region, said Dwyer, who represents three RFS defendants named in the court injunction filed by Teal-Jones logging company. The police are not using reasonable force and are reaching beyond the scope of what is required to fulfil their duties to enforce the injunction, he said, adding doing so increases the risks for everyone involved. “Considering what I’ve seen in video and from conversations with people on the ground, it’s not surprising that this many complaints would have arisen,” Dwyer said. “And given the fullness of time, I expect there will only be more filed.” Several online videos detail the confrontation between officers and protesters on a logging road in the region on Saturday. In one longer video, officers can be seen setting off multiple canisters of pepper spray at close range at a huddle of protesters who had refused to disperse and had locked arms to make their arrests more difficult. The premier and the public safety minister need to rein in the RCMP who are using unreasonable force against protesters, many of whom are Indigenous on unceded territory with inherent rights to protect the land, said Veronica Martisius, staff counsel with the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA). “The silence from (Premier) John Horgan and (Minister) Mike Farnworth is deafening,” Martisius said, noting the province has contracted the federal force to police municipalities in B.C. “When RCMP are acting unlawfully, the province should be stepping in,” Martisius said, adding officers still have a responsibility to maintain public safety while enforcing injunctions. “Police don’t have carte blanche to do whatever they want. Their power is limited when it comes to respecting civil liberties and human rights, otherwise we’d be living in a police state.” The RFS alleges police are using excessive and increasing force when making arrests, as well as operating heavy equipment and chainsaws dangerously close to protesters to extract them from the obstacles designed to frustrate arrests. One 35-year-old protester was flown by helicopter to hospital in Victoria on Saturday with neck injuries after a forceful arrest, while others have suffered a sprained ankle, a broken rib, or cuts and bruises during arrests, said RFS in a statement. The protests and protection of old-growth is cropping up as a hot-button issue in the federal election, with the Liberals pledging to do more to protect ancient forests, and members of the federal NDP calling for an investigation into police actions at Fairy Creek. NDP MP Jack Harris, with the backing of Vancouver Island incumbent candidates Alistair MacGregor and Laurel Collins, called on Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to launch a full and independent investigation into RCMP actions at Fairy Creek. The violent actions of RCMP at Fairy Creek are unacceptable and only escalate the situation, wrote MacGregor, who is running for re-election in the Cowichan-Malahat-Langford riding, on social media. “We have written to Minister Blair calling for full federal review of the situation and police actions, and we are committed to more robust and independent civilian oversight of the RCMP,” he tweeted. On Monday, hundreds of people gathered outside RCMP detachments in Victoria and other municipalities to call for the RCMP to stand down at Fairy Creek. RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Chris Manseau said protesters failed to follow officers’ directions during Saturday’s confrontation, which he said left one officer with a concussion after he was knocked over in the scuffle. “We really need to remember that it’s the actions of the protesters that dictate the actions of the police,” Manseau said. “When crowds are failing to follow police direction, one thing does lead to another. “In order to gain compliance from that large crowd of people … it took the use of pepper spray, and then the crowd followed police direction after that.” A lot of the video snippets online do not illustrate the full context of the situation, Manseau said. “There's lots of examples of peaceful, lawful, and safe protests that are occurring, even after the incident on the weekend,” he said. The RCMP cannot speak to the number of complaints made to CRCC, as it is an independent body that investigates the federal police force, Manseau said, adding he advises anyone who felt they were wronged or injured to reach out to the commission. Regardless of any potential public inquiry, RCMP will likely do an internal review of enforcement measures at Fairy Creek, Manseau said. “With enforcement actions like this, especially one that’s so large, I’m sure there will be a review,” he said. “And there are things to learn from it, and to have better practices in the future. We absolutely support that.” Police immediately need to respect the limits of their powers and act within the confines of the law when arresting people, said Martisius, but RCMP in the videos are taking heavy-handed measures against non-combative protesters. “Of course, there are folks who are engaged in civil disobedience, but that doesn't give the right to the RCMP to act violently towards those people,” she said, adding a recent court decision made it clear officers must safely arrest and remove people. “They still have a duty to protect the public.” Rochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer ​ Subject: Civil disobedience; Public inquiries; Investigations; Arrests; Court decisions; Public safety; Enforcement; Civil liberties"

"2021-08-28","Full text: (ANNews) – Calgary’s Bear Clan Patrol and the G4 First Nations co-hosted an outdoor vaccination clinic at Shaw Millenium Park on August 21 for the city’s Indigenous population and anyone else to come get their shot and enjoy some lunch. The G4 is composed of Bearspaw First Nation, Chiniki First Nation, Tsuut’ina Nation and Wesley First Nation. “Indigenous people have gone through smallpox, we’ve gone through colonization, we’ve gone through residential schools, we’ve gone through all these different things that have been meant to kill us,” says Yvonne Henderson, a co-founder of the Bear Clan Patrol, which does outreach work to assist people in distress. Henderson said Bear Clan Patrol asked for assistance from other Treaty 7 First Nations’ leadership, because only one — Siksika — has assisted them on their weekly patrol on Fridays. Tsuut’ina helps with Bear Clan’s food bank, but Henderson says they were looking for further assistance. “We’re super thankful for them, but we wanted to see more,” she said. The event was initially conceived as an outdoor lunch for the unhoused population, which was planned prior to COVID, so it ultimately came to fruition as a lunch and vaccination clinic. “Regardless of the pandemic, Indigenous people are still displaced in their traditional territory,” said Henderson. “That’s why we can’t stop.” The location wasn’t Bear Clan’s decision — unhoused people are reluctant to attend an event at Shaw Millenium Park, since they’re often kicked out of it — so after the event the Bear Clan took food to other parts of town, such as Forest Lawn, Westbrook and Marlborough, to feed the unhoused population. Joel Fischer, a nurse who works on Tsuu’tina Nation, was at the event with a mobile vaccination clinic. He said they’ve been highly successful getting people vaccinated on reserve, so they decided to help out the urban Indigenous and unhoused populations, which often overlap. Like any population, there’s some degree of vaccine hesitancy among Indigenous peoples, a distrust that is exacerbated by the legacy of colonial institutions, including the healthcare system, which Fischer says underscores the importance of actively doing outreach. “We want to make it as easy as possible, so it’s just coming downtown, trying to meet people where they’re at, having conversations with them if they’re not sure, and do whatever we can to support people in getting those vaccines,” said Fischer. “It’s a friendly and positive place for people to come and see what we’re doing.” Also in attendance was Sabrina Grover, the Liberal candidate for Calgary Centre in the upcoming federal election. “To me, reconciliation is a personal commitment that you make to working with First Nations and Indigenous (peoples) to make sure everyone has an equal chance at living sustainability,” said Grover. She said it’s important for her as a candidate to familiarize herself with groups who work closely with Indigenous communities so she can collaborate with them effectively if she’s elected. “In Calgary Centre, we know we have a large urban Indigenous population, a population which is underserved and oftentimes held down by the system, so it’s important to me to understand the work organizations like Bear Clan and G4 do, understand how to support them, and how we can lift up urban Indigenous populations,” Grover said.

He says they would establish the Canada Recovery Dividend so the institutions contribute more over the next four years of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau also renewed a 2019 promise of help for urban Indigenous housing providers, who had hoped funding would be included in the spring budget. He says Ottawa had been trying throughout the pandemic to co-develop a plan with Indigenous Peoples but it's taken longer than expected.

Blane Meek of Wilder Creek Ranching has leased the land for 30 years from B-C Hydro and wrote a letter to the regional district in July, saying the high-quality soil should be used in the future to cultivate specialty crops. The district's directors agreed, voting earlier this month to write to provincial officials expressing their opposition to B-C Hydro's plan for the land. The provincial Crown corporation is required to create 550 hectares of wetlands to replace what will be flooded by the Site C dam reservoir.

"2021-08-28","Full text: Last Canadian plane to leave Kabul on Thursday The Canadian military will end its mission at Kabul airport on Thursday, as Liberal cabinet minister Maryam Monsef sparked controversy by using the term ""brothers"" to challenge the Taliban to protect those left behind. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said because the U.S. is leading the mission and providing security, its 6,000-strong contingent must be the last to leave the airport on Aug. 31, the American deadline for departure. That means Canada's special forces and aircrews must begin their departure preparations in advance. Canada is using two C-17 transport planes to airlift Afghans to safety and is one of 13 countries taking part in the airlift. It also has special forces operatives on the ground who are working outside the airport's confines to spirit fleeing Afghans to waiting flights. ""Drawing down a mission takes a considerable amount of time. It is not done overnight, and it comes with considerable risk,"" Sajjan said. Senior government sources, who spoke anonymously citing the need to maintain operational safety, said the last C-17 would depart Kabul sometime on Thursday, but it was not clear when given the chaotic situation on the ground. Nor was it known if all Canadian military personnel would be on the plane because Canada and its allies are also helping each other by evacuating their personnel on their various flights. In the coming days, the U.S. military will have to extract its own soldiers and equipment, but will prioritize human life and helping its partners, said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. ""We are now and have been working with our allies and partners to help them withdraw their people. And we'll help them withdraw their forces as well."" The pace of Canada's evacuation efforts has ramped up noticeably in the past three days with a record 535 on a Tuesday flight, part of the frantic effort to fully evacuate all foreign nationals and vulnerable Afghans who helped Canada and its allies before the country's recent fall to the Taliban. In addition to the Aug. 31 deadline, which Taliban leaders have insisted is non-negotiable, American and Canadian military planners fear the risk of an attack on the airport and the massive throngs of would-be evacuees outside by a breakaway faction of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a group the Pentagon refers to as ISIS-K. The two most senior U.S. commanders on the ground in Kabul, Rear Admiral Peter Vasely and Maj.-Gen. Chris Donahue, are directly involved in the effort to ensure eligible evacuees are able to get into the airport, Kirby said. ""I fully recognize that not every step of this process is in our firm control, and that there are going to be instances where it doesn't work as advertised."" Monsef, the minister for women and gender equality, used a government briefing to make an impassioned appeal directly to the Taliban to allow Afghans to flee the country and respect the rights of others who are left behind. ""I want to take this opportunity to speak to our brothers, the Taliban,"" she said in a remark that caught attention on social media and on the campaign trail as the federal party leaders were vying for votes ahead of the Sept. 20 election. ""We call on you to ensure the safe and secure passage of any individual in Afghanistan out of the country. We call on you to immediately stop the violence, the genocide, the femicide, the destruction of infrastructure, including heritage buildings."" Referring to Monsef's use of the phrase ""our brothers,"" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole said, ""the language used by the Trudeau government is completely unacceptable."" Dan Albas, a Conservative running for re-election in British Columbia, said on Twitter that he strongly disagreed with Monsef's use of the term, but added: ""I also believe it is important we disagree on policy. Disagreement and debate should never be used as a catalyst for personal attacks."""
"2021-08-28","Full text: Party leaders talk affordability in B.C., Ontario OTTAWA - Canada's main political parties say they are putting your pocketbook at the top of their agendas, with varying promises to help make everything from housing to food to mobile phone bills less costly. Affordability was already a concern for many Canadians before the pandemic hit, but COVID-19 lockdowns and supply-chain constraints exacerbated many of the existing problems. That is particularly the case for a housing market made ever hotter by the pandemic that drove more Canadians to want bigger homes and bigger yards. For younger Canadians, and those with lower incomes the pre-pandemic pipe dream of home ownership was pushed even further out of reach. Inflation in July hit 3.7 per cent, the highest annual increase in more than a decade, thanks, in part, to hikes in the prices of gas and food. Those costs are being driven largely by reopening of economies driving up demand, and ongoing supply-chain constraints, both pandemic and climate related. But Statistics Canada's housing replacement cost index, which is tied to the cost of building a new home, was one of the biggest drivers. It rose almost 14 per cent, the highest increase since 1987. The Canadian Real Estate Association said the average price of buying a house jumped almost 26 per cent between June 2020 and June 2021. ""There is a cost-of-living crisis in Canada right now,"" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole said in an ad he posted Tuesday to Twitter. Experts across Canada point to supply constraints as the main driver of housing costs, and it's a problem that is years in the making. ""My take is that there has been less-than-adequate housing construction over the past five decades,"" said Murtaza Haider, a professor of real estate management at Ryerson University in Toronto. All three main national parties have now pushed out promises to help ease the cost of housing, including some form of restriction to limit foreign buyers from purchasing housing in Canada. The NDP plan is a 20 per cent tax on housing purchases by non-Canadians or permanent residents, while both the Liberals and Conservatives plan some type of ban on new foreign ownership for two years. To build more housing the NDP promised 500,000 new ""affordable"" homes built in 10 years, the Conservatives say they'll get one million new homes built in just three years, while the Liberals said they will ""build, preserve, or repair"" 1.4 million homes in four years. The parties provided few specifics on how they intend to do it, and Haider is skeptical there can be a rush to massively increase new home builds in the next year or two. He said building material shortages will continue, there are not enough trained tradespeople available to do the work, and there is no sign that demand will let up. Haider said he is intrigued by the Conservative promise to allow developers who sell existing rentals to defer capital gains taxes if they reinvest the profits to build new rentals. Construction of rental units is a particular problem in Canada's housing affordability issue, he said. The parties aren't just going after housing costs though. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is touting his pledge from last spring's budget to spend $30 billion over five years to bring child care costs down to an average of $10 a day. The Liberals signed eight provinces up to the program before the election call. Trudeau was in Surrey, B.C., Wednesday where he continued his housing theme, pledging to increase corporate income taxes on banks and insurance companies with big profits, using the revenues to help fund his promises to make housing more affordable. Trudeau noted banks and insurance companies did very well during the pandemic. ""As we rebuild, we're going to ask big financial institutions to pay a little back to pay a little more, so that we can do more for you, and in particular, so that we can help you own your home,"" he said. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, campaigning Wednesday in Windsor, Ont., said he would help ease affordability anxiety by forcing mobile phone companies to cut consumer rates. Singh didn't say how that could happen indicating only it can be done if a government is courageous enough to ""stand up to"" telecom giants. Singh said Trudeau promised to cut cellphone bills by 25 per cent in the 2019 election, instead prices have gone up. The Liberals say they're making progress on it and point to a Statistics Canada report that says consumer prices for cellular services dropped by 21.5 per cent between June 2020 and June 2021. O'Toole campaigned in southwestern Ontario Wednesday, promising some of the $60 billion in new federal health transfers to provinces that he previously pledged would be used to help at least one million more Canadians access mental health treatment each year.

"2021-08-27","Full text: RBC sees economic growth despite headwinds TORONTO - RBC chief executive David McKay says that while the COVID-19 Delta variant could slow the economic recovery, it shouldn't be enough to halt the current momentum. Speaking on an earnings call Wednesday, he said that given Canadian vaccination rates, the bank isn't anticipating the kind of economic shutdown the country saw last year and into early 2021, and instead expects only a slowing of the return to work and full reopening. ""What's going to happen with the Delta variant, it may pause things for a month or two as we have to work through and make sure we don't overwhelm the health system. It's a little concerning to see the numbers,"" he said. ""But that will not, I think, upend the majority of the momentum we have. So still very positive about the continued progress on reopening the economy through the next 12 to 24 months."" Along with the impacts of COVID-19 variants, he said the bank is watching other challenges to global growth including the inconsistent global vaccine rollout, supply chain disruptions, rising geopolitical risk and continued global travel restrictions. The bank, however, is encouraged by economic indicators such as rising credit card spending and business investments, draws on operating working capital lines and the growth of term asset lending. ""You're seeing all the signs of economic confidence,"" said McKay. The bank has also seen significant mortgage growth, up $37 billion year over year including over $9 billion in the third quarter, a growth trend that McKay said he expects to continue, though at a slower rate than what's happened over the ""exceptional"" last year. Rising mortgage loans have coincided with a big spike in home prices, but McKay said the bank isn't worried about the quality of its credit book so much as the long-term macroeconomic issues. ""Where I do worry,"" he said, ""is the more cash flow that consumers are putting in to housing stock, the less is available to drive the economy. So I think all policy-makers are worried partly as well about long-term economic drag from that much cash flow going into servicing housing."" He stopped short of commenting on any specific housing policy proposals put out in the election, which have covered everything from banning blind bidding and foreign homebuyers to rental subsidies and supply commitments, saying that policies are required that balance the needs, prosperity, and happiness of Canadians. For now, mortgage loans helped boost RBC earnings, though the bank saw much bigger gains from the further winding down of its provisions for credit loss. Earnings came in at $4.3 billion, or $2.97 per diluted share in the quarter, up from $3.2 billion or $2.20 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. The bank reported a $540 million reversal on its provisions for credit losses in the quarter ending July 30, compared with the $675 million it set aside for losses last year. Revenue totalled $12.8 billion, down from $12.9 billion last year. Adjusted earnings per share totalled $3 per diluted share for the quarter compared with an adjusted profit of $2.23 per diluted share a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.71 per share, according to financial market data firm Refinitiv. The credit loss provisions were a key driver of the analyst beat, said John Aiken, the head of research in Canada forBarclays, in a note. ""Provisions were significantly below expectations on both a performing and impaired basis, which we estimate added roughly $0.30 per share to earnings. Impaired loan balances were down across all geographies with a significant drop off in new formations."" While the earnings were roughly in line with expectations outside the boost from provisions, Aiken said he was encouraged that the bank showed strength in higher-multiple businesses like retail banking and wealth management. RBC said its personal and commercial banking business earned $2.11 billion, up from $1.37 billion a year ago, helped by a reversal in its provisions for credit losses. Wealth management reported a profit of $738 million compared with $562 million in the same quarter last year, while RBC's insurance business earned $234 million, up from $216 million a year ago. RBC's capital markets arm earned $1.13 billion, up from $949 million in the same quarter last year, helped by the reversal in its provisions for credit losses and record corporate and investment banking revenue. Investor and treasury services saw net income of $88 million, up from $76 million a year ago. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 25, 2021. Companies in this story: (TSX:RY)"

Joining remotely to present the annual operations of the SouthGrow Regional Initiative at town council’s regular meeting held on Aug. 16 was their Executive Director Peter Casurella. Casurella stated that from spring of 2020 to summer 2021 was a weird year and the association had to do a lot of pivoting to do in order to deliver on their promised and mandated projects. “Despite everything it was a very encouraging year because we struck up a very useful partnership with Economic Development Lethbridge in order to deliver services to the region during the height of the pandemic. That was a result of the relationships that we and you built,” stated Casurella. “Highway 3 and out involvement with the Twinning Association continues to be a success story that we are proud of.” Casurella also revealed the association has a zero emissions vehicle infrastructure program rolling out. “SouthGrow is one of two in Alberta that got funding from Natural Resources Canada — 50 per cent funding to fund the installation of electric vehicle chargers. It is a way to contribute to infrastructure development and future proof out communities. It was supposed to start in September but the election call threw a wrench into those plans so it’ll start a little later.” The association has been pushing for broadband in southern Alberta for a long time, and had found one that worked well. Grants for a pilot project in Milk River were applied for and they got the money. The Rural Development Network of Canada was very interested in helping support the project. “So we now have two big projects waiting grant approval to finish and then we’ll connect all of SouthGrow. We will hopefully have good network all across southern Alberta, south of Calgary. I am proud to say we will have helped make southern Alberta one of the most connected regions in the entire country.” To end the presentation, Casurella wanted to emphasize the opportunity for energy in Alberta. “I want to talk to councils and start to advocate and talk to the government about the economic opportunity that exists in alternative and fuel energy for Alberta just in the way we talked about the importance of broadband.” Town council accepted this presentation as information.

A new study finds warming waters caused by climate change are pushing sea stars close to extinction along parts of the North American coast. The research published by the Royal Society says sea stars in the waters off British Columbia that died off in the billions about a decade ago are not recovering as expected. Sara Hamilton, the study's lead author and a Ph-D student at Oregon State University, says parts of British Columbia still have some populations of sea stars but it's unclear if they'll survive. She says the starfish develop a wasting disease that can kill them within 48 hours and may be caused by a virus or bacteria that thrives in warm waters. Sea stars are important in ocean habitat because they keep sea urchins in check, which can decimate kelp forests that are important habitat for marine wildlife. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... KABUL, Afghanistan — U.S. President Joe Biden is sticking to his Aug. 31 deadline for finishing a U.S.-led evacuation of Americans, at-risk Afghans and others, saying the longer troops remain at Kabul's airport, the greater the risk of attacks by terror groups. The decision opens him up to criticism for caving to the Taliban, who say they will not permit the evacuation to go on longer, and to the prospect that some people who want to leave will be left behind. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, said Tuesday that the major industrialized nations will not recognize a Taliban government unless it guarantees people can leave the country. Biden's decision defies allied leaders who want to give the evacuation more time and opens him to criticism that he caved to Taliban deadline demands. “Every day we’re on the ground is another day that we know ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport and attack both us and allied forces and innocent civilians,” Biden said at the White House, referring to the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate, which is known for staging suicide attacks on civilians. He said the Taliban are co-operating and security is holding despite a number of violent incidents. “But it’s a tenuous situation,” he said, adding, “We run a serious risk of it breaking down as time goes on.” The United States in recent days has ramped up its airlift amid new reports of rights abuses that fuel concern about the fate of thousands of people who fear retribution from the Taliban and are trying to flee the country. The Pentagon said 21,600 people had been evacuated in the 24 hours that ended Tuesday morning, and Biden said an additional 12,000 had been flown out in the 12 hours that followed. Those include flights operated by the U.S. military as well as other charter flights. In Kabul, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference the U.S. must stick to its self-imposed deadline, saying “after that we won’t let Afghans be taken out” on evacuation flights. He also said the Taliban would bar Afghans from accessing roads to the airport, while allowing foreigners to pass in order to prevent large crowds from massing. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... LES CAYES, Haiti — More than a week after Haiti's devastating 7.2-magnitude earthquake, a dilemma has emerged for the region’s limited health care services: how to turn over hospital beds when discharged patients have no place to go."
"2021-08-27","Full text: Today in History - Aug. 25 Today in History for Aug. 25: In 1530, Ivan the Terrible, Czar of Muscovy, was born. He ascended to the Russian throne at the age of three and eventually became the first czar. Ivan laid the foundations for the Russian empire but in 1560 embarked on a rampage of murder and destruction, even murdering his son and only heir. In 1560, Protestantism was formally adopted at the First General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament had earlier voted to accept a Calvinist confession of faith, declaring that the Roman Catholic pope no longer had jurisdiction over Scotland. In 1760, Fort Levis near Prescott, Ont., above the St. Lawrence rapids, was taken by British Gen. Jeffrey Amherst in France's last stand in North America. In 1818, the Bank of Canada commenced operations in Montreal. In 1819, Scottish engineer and inventor James Watt died. Watt, who coined the term ""horsepower"" and is considered by some to be the father of the industrial revolution, devised the first efficient steam engine and was the first to use such an engine to turn a wheel. In 1825, Uruguay proclaimed its independence from Brazil. In 1860, the Prince of Wales drove the last rivet of the Victoria Bridge in Montreal. In 1867, Michael Faraday, the English scientist who discovered electromagnetic induction, died. In 1875, Capt. Matthew Webb became the first person to swim the 34-km English Channel without a life-jacket. In 1878, the ""Saskatchewan Herald,"" the province's first newspaper, put out its first issue in Battleford. Because the paper predated any railway in Saskatchewan, then the Northwest Territories, founder Patrick Gammie Laurie transported his first printing press by ox cart on a 72-day trek from Fort Garry. In 1900, German philosopher and poet Friedrich Nietzsche died after prolonged insanity. In 1906, King Edward VII granted Saskatchewan its coat of arms. In 1919, the first international air service began with Air Transport and Travel's flight from London to Paris. Only one passenger made the trip on a converted biplane bomber. The trip took two-and-a-half hours and cost 21 pounds. In 1934, Prime Minister R. B. Bennett unveiled the St. Malo Cross at Gaspe, Que., to mark explorer Jacques Cartier's first landing. In 1937, Toronto announced school openings would be delayed because of a polio epidemic sweeping southern Ontario. In 1939, Britain and Poland signed a treaty of mutual support, days after the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was announced. The Second World War broke out Sept. 1st when Germany invaded Poland. In 1939, the film ""The Wizard of Oz,"" opened across the U.S. In 1940, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were incorporated into the Soviet Union. On the same day, British planes dropped their first bombs on Berlin during the Second World War. In 1942, the Duke of Kent was killed in a plane crash in Scotland. In 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first U.S. president to visit Ottawa. Roosevelt and prime ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King of Canada and Winston Churchill of Britain had earlier attended the Quebec Conference in Quebec City. In 1944, Allied forces liberated Paris, ending four years of German occupation during the Second World War. The German commander, Maj. Gen. Dietrich von Choltitz, had defied Adolf Hitler's order to level the French capital rather than give it up. The surrender set off wild celebrations in the streets. In 1953, Dmitri Stepanovich Chuvakhin was named Soviet ambassador to Canada. It was the first time the post had been filled since 1945 when Igor Gouzenko, a Soviet Embassy cipher clerk, disclosed a Russian spy ring in Canada. In 1981, the McDonald Commission on RCMP wrongdoing issued its final report. Its recommendations included setting up a new spy agency separate from the Mounties. The Trudeau government responded by establishing CSIS, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. In 1984, author Truman Capote was found dead in a Los Angeles mansion. He was 59. An autopsy revealed he overdosed on valium, codeine and barbiturates. In 1984, Tory leader Brian Mulroney slammed Liberal Prime Minister John Turner in a televised election debate. Mulroney charged Turner had a choice when presented with a list of patronage appointments from former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. The Conservatives went on to a landslide election victory. In 1986, wheelchair athlete Rick Hansen began the cross-Canada portion of his round-the-world journey. Only $172,000 had been donated for spinal cord research when he reached Canada's most eastern point, Cape Spear, Nfld. But an outpouring of support from Canadians allowed him to reach his goal of $10 million by the time he returned home to Williams Lake, B.C., on April 2, 1987. Hansen, a world-class competitor in wheelchair sports, was inspired by his friend Terry Fox, an amputee whose run across Canada for cancer research was stopped after he developed cancer again. Hansen left Vancouver on March 21, 1985. He travelled through 34 countries, including the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union and Australia. His journey lasted 792 days, 467 of which were spent on the road. In 1987, the Canadian Medical Association approved an amendment to their code of ethics on patient confidentiality, allowing for the ""discreet disclosure"" of blood test results of people infected with the AIDS virus. In 1989, the ""Voyager 2"" spacecraft flew past the planet Neptune and its moon, Triton. It sent back photos of swampy areas, frozen lakes and craters. In 1990, Morley Callaghan, the renowned Canadian author and broadcaster, died in Toronto at age 87. He wrote more than 20 novels and about 100 short stories. He won the Governor General’s award in 1952 for his novel ""The Loved and The Lost."" Callaghan, who had been nominated for a Nobel Prize in literature, often believed he was taken for granted in Canada despite his fame outside the country.

The deal ceded control of 39,000 square kilometres of lake, river and tundra between the Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes, an area larger than Belgium. The area is also home to both of Canada’s diamond mines. In 2003, at least 51 people were killed in Mumbai, India, when bombs in two taxis exploded minutes apart in a crowded jewelry market in the financial district and in front of the tourist attraction, Gateway of India. In 2004, the Bank of Canada unveiled a new $20 bill with updated anti-counterfeiting features. (In May 2012, a new $20 polymer bill was introduced). In 2009, U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the last brother of the Kennedy political dynasty, died at his home in Hyannis Port, Mass., after battling a brain tumour. He was 77. Known as the liberal lion of the Senate, Kennedy was the third-longest serving senator in American history, serving almost 47 years. He was a steadfast champion of the working class and the poor and known as a powerful voice on health care, civil rights, war and peace. In 2011, Zetas cartel gunmen entered Casino Royale in Monterrey, Mexico, spread gasoline and set the building on fire, killing 52 people. In 2012, Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, died at age 82 following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures. He commanded the Apollo 11 spacecraft that landed on the moon July 20, 1969. His first words after setting foot on the surface are etched in history books and the memories of those who heard them in a live broadcast - ""That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."" In 2017, Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane off the coast of mainland Texas near Corpus Christi. It lingered off the coast for four days, dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm - with record flooding (1.2 metres) in parts of Houston - killing at least 65 people, destroying thousands of cars and leaving hundreds of thousands of families with flood-damaged homes. In 2018, Arizona Senator John McCain died of brain cancer one day after announcing he would not be seeking further treatment. He was 81. In more than three decades in Congress, McCain became known as a political maverick willing to stick to his convictions rather than go along with party leaders. The bitter rival of U.S. President Donald Trump famously cast the deciding no vote that stopped the Republican push to repeal Obamacare. In 2019, top-ranked Jin Young Ko won the CP Women's Open. The South Korean closed with a 64 for a 26-under-par 262 total, five shots better than Denmark's Nicole Broch Larsen.

"2021-08-27","Full text: GUYSBOROUGH – “It’s time to start living more with COVID,” Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, said at a news conference announcing the back-to-school plan on Monday, August 23. Two weeks before students and staff return to classrooms on Sept. 7, they learned that school will be a return to more familiar routine. While in the first week of school masks will be required inside a school building or bus, when the province enters Phase 5 of its reopening plan, scheduled for Sept. 15, masks will become optional. Entry into Phase 5 is dependent on the rate of vaccination within the province; 75 per cent of the population must be fully vaccinated (have two doses of vaccine) before Phase 5 protocols can be implemented. ""Our schools are as safe as our communities and thanks to safe and effective vaccines, and Nova Scotians rolling up their sleeves, our schools have an additional layer of protection this year that will allow students to have a much more normal year,"" said Strang adding, “We continue to have core public health measures in place to protect everyone in our schools, including wearing masks, frequent hand washing, staying home if you're sick and sanitizing high-touch surfaces."" Although Nova Scotia has navigated the pandemic well, concerns and reluctance to reduce public health restrictions may remain for some, especially for parents of children who are not eligible for vaccination; those under 12 years of age. The Journal asked Strang, during the news conference, what options were available for parents and guardians who don’t want to send their children to school when masks are no longer mandatory in Phase 5. Strang replied that in such cases, the parents would have to consult with the principal and school administration, “and as appropriate, virtual learning or take-home learning arrangements can be made with that student.” Since movement into Phase 5 has been framed as contingent upon a 75 per cent rate of full vaccination within the province, The Journal asked Strang if case numbers, which have been creeping up this past week, would affect the decision to move into Phase 5, which includes the removal of the mandatory masking requirement in schools. Strang answered, “No, I’ve always said the decisions are based on the epidemiology not on a case number. It is always the trend that we are seeing, and the average number of cases that we are seeing over time, the context of the cases. Right now, we’re still very comfortable with what we’re seeing. There’s no sign of community spread; it’s travel or close contact, and the number of contacts per case. So, there are a number of things that we look at some of them number driven, some of them contextual … it’s more than just a single number that would drive any sort of decision around epidemiology.” In a news release issued shortly after the back-to-school announcement, the Nova Scotia Teacher’s Union (NSTU) stated it was “pleased that a back-to-school plan has been released, which families, teachers and students have been anxiously anticipating for weeks.” NSTU President Paul Wozney said, “Premier Designate Houston said during his first press conference following the election that releasing the back-to-school plan was his top priority and he’s certainly fulfilled that commitment … I’ve already had one discussion with Mr. Houston since the election and I’m very optimistic about his proactive approach to engaging with Nova Scotia’s teachers and education specialists.” The Strait Regional Centre for Education’s Regional Executive Director of Education, Paul Landry, sent an email to the school community after the announcement stating, “I am excited to welcome you all back into our buildings for the start of another year. This school year, our educational routine will look more familiar, with a full return to music, band, field trips, and clubs. All school sports will resume. Gyms will be open to community groups in the evenings and on weekends. Students and staff will once again be able to use cafeterias and participate in food programs as they have in previous years. Parents and guardians who follow public health measures will be allowed to visit schools, including on the first day of school for our youngest learners.” As of Sept. 7 students, families and staff can expect the following when they return to school: · full in-class learning with the associated academic, social and emotional supports · continued use of outdoor learning, small-group instruction, and enhanced use of technology · full resumption of music classes, band, sports, use of cafeterias, lockers and cubbies, extra-curricular activities and community use of gyms, following core public health measures · ongoing inspections and maintenance of school ventilation systems · school counsellors, SchoolsPlus staff, and others will continue to provide timely and appropriate mental health supports to students · schools will create supportive environments for those who choose to wear a mask once the province enters Phase 5 · non-essential visitors will be permitted (following all safety protocols), although virtual meetings and visits are still encouraged · parents and guardians of pre-primary and Primary students will be able to visit schools on their child's first day Subject: Press conferences; Parents & parenting; Public health; Students; Schools; Epidemiology; Immunization; Learning; Education"
"2021-08-27","Full text: Biden firm, for now, on Aug. 31 Kabul deadline OTTAWA - While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered Tuesday to keep Canadian military personnel in Afghanistan after Aug. 31, his fellow G7 leaders were not able to persuade President Joe Biden to extend the American deadline for withdrawal. Trudeau, emerging from a virtual summit with his G7 counterparts, said Canada would keep special forces operatives and aircrews at the airport in Kabul past the end of the month. The leaders met to discuss the crisis and the re-emergence of the Taliban as the country's rulers. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hosted the summit, and France's Emmanuel Macron were among those calling for an extension in order to more fully evacuate all foreign nationals and vulnerable Afghans who helped the Americans and the NATO allies before the country's recent fall to the Taliban. A readout from the White House made clear they had failed to persuade Biden — at least for now — to open the door to staying longer. ""During a meeting this morning with the G7 leaders, the president conveyed that our mission in Kabul will end based on the achievement of our objectives. He confirmed we are currently on pace to finish by Aug. 31,"" the statement said. ""The completion of the mission by Aug. 31 depends on continued co-ordination with the Taliban, including continued access for evacuees to the airport,"" it continued. ""In addition, the president has asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans to adjust the timeline should that become necessary."" During a media briefing Tuesday that had been delayed for several hours, White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to say explicitly whether Biden was open to extending the deadline, but pointed repeatedly to the conditions noted in the statement. ""He asked for contingency plans,"" Psaki said, ""but believes we continue to be on track to accomplish our mission."" The president himself emerged later Tuesday, five hours behind schedule, to drive home the point that the U.S., the G7, NATO, the European Union and the United Nations had all agreed to continue pulling in the same direction. ""We will stand united in our approach to the Taliban,"" Biden said. ""We agreed the legitimacy of any future government depends on the approach it now takes to uphold international obligations, including to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a base for terrorism. And we agreed that none of us are going to take the Taliban's word for it. We will judge them by their actions."" Biden also told his fellow leaders that each day on ground added to the risk from troops posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant — Khorasan Province, the terrorist organization active in Central Asia. The Taliban has also said that the deadline is firm and hinted at consequences if it is not met. Johnson called the ""urgent"" summit of G7 leaders to discuss the evacuation crisis and plot longer-term engagement with Afghanistan's new Taliban leaders, as well as deal with the humanitarian crisis for refugees. The leaders' communique did not address the issue of an extension. But they called on the Taliban to respect human rights, especially those of women and minorities, and allow unfettered humanitarian access. ""Afghanistan must never again become a safe haven for terrorism, nor a source of terrorist attacks,"" it said. After the meeting, Trudeau said Canada would be prepared to stay longer, if that were possible, beyond Aug. 31. ""The commitment by our fellow G7 nations is clear: we're all going to work together to save as many people as possible,"" Trudeau said as he was about to board a federal election campaign bus in Hamilton."

"2021-08-27","Full text: This is Randy Hoback’s fifth election run, and not only is he planning to keep his seat, he has full confidence it will be as part of a Conservative majority in Ottawa. Hoback was one of 14 Conservative candidates elected as the party swept Saskatchewan in 2019. Now, he’s confident they can extend that success to the rest of the country in 2021 “If you would have asked me three weeks ago, I would have said this is tough,” he said on August 23. Hoback argued his party set the conversation for the campaign by releasing a platform right away. He said that’s helped them make headway with voters faced with uncertainty. “Talking about securing Canada’s future, jobs, health care, dealing with the addictions crisis and mental health,” Hoback said. “Basically, everything is around the word securing.” Hoback said the federal government’s debt load and coping with the re-opening of the economy are common issues that keep popping up when he talks to people in the riding. “They are really concerned about getting back to work and finding employees,” Hoback stated. “They’re having a shortage of employees. They want to see those people come back into the work force that are sitting on CERB payments right now.” Asked what have been some accomplishments during his term as Member of Parliament, which started in 2008, Hoback points to the Canada/US trade agreement. “Basically it was us, myself and the trade committee who were opening up the Rolodexes in Washington to make sure that we had something that at least secured what we had for a trade agreement,” he said. “It was something that took a lot of time and took a lot of effort but I think we achieved as good a result as possible, considering the leadership we had on the Canadian side.” He is running again because there are still some things he wants to accomplish, especially when it comes to international trade. “There’s still work to do on the international stage. There’s still a lot of rebuilding that needs to happen,” he said. Rebuilding connections can help bring Canada back up to its former glory, he said. On the local stage, he said there is a lot of work to do at the area recovers from COVID-19. “There are addictions issues, there are people that are needing assistance and help and that’s a part of the job people aren’t talking about,” he said. Hoback argued his team in Prince Albert and Nipawin are good at assisting local residents with problems, like helping people having trouble with their Old Age Security pensions. “Those are the victories that we don’t talk about a lot, but actually mean a lot to people and actually give me a lot of benefit in the job,” he said.

"2021-08-27","Full text: Public officials in one of Canada's busiest border cities say it’s disappointing the U.S. remains closed to Canadians crossing over on land, especially for those who can’t afford to travel by air. Sarnia Mayor Mike Bradley, whose area sits on the Canadian side of the Blue Water Bridge border crossing, said he’s frustrated with the ongoing delay – noting Canadians have been waiting nearly 18 months to cross but have few options to do so. “You can fly into the U.S., but you cannot cross by car,” Bradley said, citing one example of a helicopter service offering 15-minute charter flights from Windsor to Detroit for people looking to cross the U.S. border. He added that prices are high, ranging from $750 (U.S.) a seat to more than $2,000 for a group booking. “There's a lot of marriages, there's a lot of relationships and families on both sides,” Bradley said. “It just makes it tougher for them if you say you need to fly and spend all that money to get into the U.S.” Fully vaccinated Americans have been able to enter Canada for non-essential purposes since Aug. 9. But Canadians looking to enter the U.S. by land will have to wait at least another month, the U.S. government announced last week. Bradley believes the U.S. decision to extend the border closing boils down to two main reasons: a spike in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the government “treating the Canadian border the same as the Mexican border,” he said."

"2021-08-26","Full text: While Midland was very grateful for the way the pie tasted and appreciated getting their slice, they couldn’t help but ask if there was a reason why their slice was so small in comparison to others at the table. Two delegation requests were granted for CAO David Denault and Mayor Stewart Strathearn at the recent virtual Association of Municipalities Ontario (AMO) conference, with the local representatives talking to the province about Midland’s financial requirements and the disparity of funding the town receives annually. In a conversation with MidlandToday, CAO Denault related how speaking with Vincent Ke, parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, and with Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma were quite similar in topic and scope. “It went quite well,” said Denault. “We were trying to make sure people understand Midland and all the benefits and exciting things going on, but also understand our circumstances and how they can help us. That was the backdrop for both the ministries.” The reason for the delegations was to secure funding from the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund (OMPF) for Midland, which is the main general assistance grant of $500 million to 389 municipalities across the province. “In Midland’s circumstances, we showed them statistics that said, ‘We don’t participate in that funding as much as we think we should,'” said Denault. Denault provided statistics during the delegations which gave the ministers a look at Midland’s unique circumstances in regards to the three questioned components of calculating OMPF distribution: Is the municipality rural, is the municipality northern, and what’s the municipality’s average property assessment relative to the province. Midland doesn’t qualify for the first two, but does for the third."

"2021-08-26","Full text: Chatham-Kent–Leamington MPP Rick Nicholls told The Chatham Voice he has “no regrets” about refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The decision cost him his job as deputy speaker of the Ontario Legislature and saw Premier Doug Ford him toss him from the Progressive Conservative caucus. Nicholls, who will now represent C-K-L as an Independent, said Sunday he has received tremendous support for taking a stand against what he calls “an experimental drug, not a vaccine. “The outpouring of support has been incredible,” Nicholls said. “Not just locally, but from across the country.” While he acknowledged there are plenty of people who disagree, Nicholls said he made his decision “based on principle. “It’s all about choice,” the veteran politician explained, adding it comes down to the fact people should be free to choose what they put into their bodies. Nicholls said the decision by Ford Friday to oust him from caucus is purely political. He said the premier’s office was under pressure from Toronto media nosing around about the number of MPPs who were vaccinated. Pressure was created by the opposition as well, he added. Nicholls said he received a “demanding ultimatum type phone call” from one of Ford’s top aides Aug. 16, advising him he had 72 hours to get the shot. The politician called it a “bullying” tactic, and one hour before the 5 p.m. deadline Aug. 19, he called a press conference announcing his decision. “I fully knew what the consequences would be,” Nicholls said. “I was prepared to put my political career in jeopardy. I know a lot of people are disappointed in it, but this is my choice.” Scarborough MPP Christina Mitas, is the only other MPP who has not taken the vaccine to remain in the PC caucus. She has been provided a medical exemption from her doctor. Nicholls, who has served three terms in office, said he took Ford “at his word” when he said the government would not mandate vaccines for the people of Ontario. He doesn’t believe the vaccine should be mandated in any form and does not support municipalities forcing the employees or the general public to get the shot. Ultimately, Nicholls said, it came down to his belief that not enough clinical research has been done to support the COVID-19 vaccine and determine its long-term effects. Nicholls, who was invited to tell his story at a People’s Party of Canada fundraising dinner held by Chatham-Kent-Leamington federal candidate Liz Vallee on the weekend, said he’s not joining the PPC. “I will remain apolitical on this,” he said. “I am not switching parties. “My party is the independent party.” By the time Nicholls finishes his current term, he will have served Chatham-Kent-Leamington for 10.5 years. No names have been put forward by the PCs to fill his spot, but the MPP said there are plenty of good people ready to fill the seat. “I’ve worked hard to keep this riding blue and I would want it to stay blue,” Nicholls said, adding he won’t run in the next election. Nicholls said he holds no animosity towards the premier or his colleagues at Queen’s Park. Subject: COVID-19 vaccines; Coronaviruses"

"2021-08-26","Full text: Clive village council set the date for a town hall type meeting to offer information to the public about the municipality's membership in a major water commission. The decision was made at the Aug. 16 regular meeting of council. Village Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Carla Kenney presented councillors with a memo requesting they pick a date for the public information session for the Hwy. #12/21 Water Commission town hall meeting. The meeting will offer information to the public on the village’s membership in this organization and how belonging to it will affect Clive residents. Mayor Lucy Henry suggested the first week of November to avoid Christmas events closer to the end of that month. Coun. Jeremy Whelan suggested a week night to avoid conflict with weekend events. Councillors discussed the suggestion and directed Kenney to narrow down the dates to a day between Nov. 1 and 4. Urban hens The ubiquitous urban chicken was discussed by Clive councillors after a local resident requested the Land Use Bylaw (LUB) be tweaked to allow an applicant up to six hens in village limits, up from the current four. Kenney stated Clive currently has six persons permitted to have urban hens. Coun. Susan Russell stated she wasn’t sure increasing the number of allowable hens was the best move at this time as only one person was requesting the increase. Coun. Tracy Hallman stated she didn’t have a problem with increasing the number allowed to each applicant as they don’t necessarily have to have six and boosting the number by two hens was fairly small. Coun. Norma Penny stated she didn’t have a problem with the request either as long as they were hens and not roosters. While councillors discussed the issue Kenney noted the bylaw still limits the total number of urban chickens in Clive to 40. When asked if predator problems have been linked to urban chickens in Clive, the CAO reported she has never heard any complaints about that. Councillors instructed Kenney to bring a tweaked bylaw granting this request back to a future council meeting. Accessible council meetings Councillors discussed moving their public meetings into the room in the village office basement permanently. Mayor Henry noted the basement meeting room may not be physically accessible to everyone in the community but suggested using Zoom online video service would solve that problem. Henry also suggested the village improve the public gallery in the downstairs room. Kenney stated the downstairs room is better suited to council meetings and noted the public could watch the meetings online through Zoom either at home or at the village office on a tablet. Delegations could also present to council virtually through Zoom. Councillors unanimously approved the change. Police report Councillors examined a number of documents forwarded by the village’s RCMP detachment based in Blackfalds, including the quarterly report for the first part of 2021. Mayor Henry noted it appears numbers are dropping for the majority of offences. The mayor stated it appears the task force approach is working. Coun. Russell stated that there has been a decrease in the number of break and enters and wondered if it’s because, during the pandemic, many people spent more time at home. “I think it has to do with COVID,” said Russell. However, Henry also noted some categories are increasing in numbers, including crimes against persons. Coun. Whelan mentioned a recent incident near Red Deer where a suspect trespassed on private property and, after the third incident, was shot by the property owner. Body worn cameras Mayor Henry noted a report sent to council on efforts to outfit bodily-worn cameras for RCMP officers in Alberta. Henry predicted the cost of those cameras would be downloaded onto local municipalities. CAO report Kenney reported two nomination papers have been accepted from local residents interested in running for village council. The municipal election will be held in October. Coun. Hallman suggested the nominees be publicly posted, for example, on social media every two weeks. The CAO reported property taxes are being paid on a steady basis. Cat traps Councillors discussed cat traps and how they’re handled in Clive. Kenney stated two cat traps are available at the village office for local residents and require the user to register to book them out. The CAO stated there are also guidelines for their use, for example, only during pleasant weather so any cat trapped in one doesn’t suffer in very hot, cold or wet weather. Those who’ve trapped a cat can choose to take the animal to the kennel but if they instead want the animal control contractor to pick up the cat, they must make their own arrangements before the trap is returned. While the village has two traps, the contractor also has traps but a cash deposit is required to book them out. Subject: Meetings; Cameras; Councils; Towns"

"2021-08-26","Full text: N.S. brings back some border rules with N.B. HALIFAX - New Brunswickers who aren't fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be treated like travellers from outside the Atlantic region and must isolate upon entering Nova Scotia, premier-designate Tim Houston told reporters Monday. Houston made the announcement alongside chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang in the premier-designate's first COVID-19 briefing since his Progressive Conservatives won a majority mandate in last week's election. ""We expect this to impact a very small number of people,"" Houston said of the border measure, which begins Wednesday. ""The reality is being cautious has kept this province safe and we will continue to be cautious."" Houston cited rising cases in New Brunswick as the reason people coming from that province with just one dose of vaccine will have to isolate for a week and produce a negative test. Unvaccinated travellers, meanwhile, will face two weeks of isolation upon entering the province. The policy is the same as the one already in place for travellers coming from provinces and territories outside Atlantic Canada. ""New Brunswick has seen a recent rise in cases and some of our cases in the last week are directly linked to that province,"" Strang said. ""This is about a small percentage of people who are travelling for recreation or leisure and are not yet vaccinated."" Health officials in New Brunswick on Monday said they had identified 58 new cases of COVID-19 since Saturday, and 85 per cent of them involved people who weren't fully vaccinated. The province has reported 340 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since July 1. On Monday, health officials in Nova Scotia reported 17 new cases of COVID-19 since the last update on Friday. Houston and Strang said New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs and that province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Jennifer Russell, had been advised of the new border requirement. Officials also announced that the final phase of Nova Scotia's five-step reopening plan is set to go into effect Sept. 15. as long as 75 per cent of the province's population is fully vaccinated. Houston said the province is on track to have about 72 per cent of its population fully vaccinated by the end of August, although he said about 100,000 people still haven't had a first dose. ""If we hit the (75 per cent) target sooner, we will work with public health to change the (September) date accordingly,"" Houston said. The final phase of the reopening will mean restrictions such as masking, physical distancing and gathering limits will no longer be necessary, Strang said. ""It's time to start living more with COVID even if we see rising case numbers that would have previously meant provincewide restrictions,"" he said. ""Our vaccine coverage means we can carry on with only border restrictions and maybe if necessary, targeted local restrictions."" With public schools scheduled to reopen Sept. 7, officials also released the province's back-to-school-plan. It will initially require masks to be worn inside school buildings or buses at all times except when eating, drinking, participating in physical activity and for breaks where people are physically distanced. As the province enters Phase 5 of its reopening plan, schools will be allowed to transition to optional mask use. Schools are asked to create ""supportive environments"" for those who choose to continue wearing masks once Phase 5 begins. Non-essential visitors will be allowed in schools, although virtual meetings and visits will still be encouraged, and if restrictions are required, students will move to at-home learning, although the government didn't set specific infection levels that would trigger schools to close. In a news release, the Nova Scotia Teachers' Union said it supported the mask order for students across all grades and would consult its members about other aspects of the province's plan over the coming days. ""The NSTU has always felt that until this pandemic is over, every student that can, should be required to wear a mask in school to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" union president Paul Wozney said.

"2021-08-26","Full text: Canadian special forces outside Kabul airport OTTAWA - On the eve of a special G7 leaders' meeting, Canadian officials disclosed Monday the military's special forces are operating outside the closed confines of Kabul's chaotic airport to get people on flights out of Afghanistan. The officials would not provide more details, citing the sensitivity of the security situation, but they said they are having success in getting more Afghans to safety. They said a Canadian C-17 Globemaster carried 436 people out of Kabul airport on Sunday night, including Canadian citizens and family members, as well as Afghan nationals accepted for resettlement by Canada and its allies — up from the 121 airlifted a day earlier. ""We are having success getting folks into HKIA in significant numbers, which has been a significant improvement over the last few days,"" said one official, using the acronym for Hamid Karzai International Airport. ""We made the decision to disclose that Canada's special operations forces have been and continue to work outside the confines of HKIA."" The official said the special forces personnel ""are working relentlessly"" to bring as many Canadian citizens and eligible Afghans through security gates to waiting aircraft. The disclosure came during a briefing for journalists on Monday that was given by three senior federal officials, on the condition they not be named as per the agreements for such background briefings. Desperate Afghans who previously worked as interpreters for Western military forces and news agencies, among others, are in hiding, fearing for the safety of themselves and their families after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban last week and exposed them to violent reprisals. ""Our forces on the ground have all the necessary authorizations to do what they feel is necessary to save as many people as quickly as possible,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in Halifax during a federal election campaign appearance. The crisis in Afghanistan has featured prominently during the first week of the federal campaign. Trudeau said he will also be taking part in a virtual G7 meeting Tuesday that will be looking at ways to address the crisis. ""When we have our G7 leaders meeting shortly, we will certainly be talking about what more we can do and must do,"" Trudeau said. That includes looking at what else can be done to help other vulnerable Afghans, including women and children, as well as human-rights activists, politicians, journalists and others who are now in the Taliban's crosshairs for their democracy-building efforts of the last two decades. Trudeau said that while the government's focus is on helping Canadian citizens and Afghans and their families with direct connections to Canada — a group that includes interpreters and other workers — he is interested in looking at ways to cast a wider net. “We are also very interested in activists and human rights leaders, journalists and people who over the past many years have fought and delivered improvements for people in Afghanistan. We know those people need to be brought to safety. And we, alongside our allies, will be doing everything we can for all the categories,” Trudeau said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is convening the meeting of G7 leaders, saying urgent talks are necessary. There is widespread speculation that U.S. President Joe Biden will face calls from his allies to extend the Aug. 31 deadline he has set to withdraw U.S. troops from Kabul airport. British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has called that deadline, set by the U.S. in a deal with the Taliban, a mistake and has urged the Americans to extend the mission for several days. The Taliban has warned that any extension would be viewed as crossing a ""red line"" and would provoke a reaction. A senior British official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the record, said the G7 talks would encompass ""immediate co-operation on the evacuation effort from Kabul and longer-term planning on future engagement in Afghanistan, as well as the humanitarian response and support for refugees."" The official said Johnson would be looking for commitments from his fellow leaders on ways to protect the rights of women and minorities, and to work toward Afghanistan not becoming a terrorist haven once more. Canadian officials did not immediately have a breakdown of the number of women and children who have been brought out of Afghanistan, including on the latest flight. The head of the Canadian branch of the organization Save The Children called Monday on world leaders to do more to streamline their processes for evacuating young people from Afghanistan. ""Though Canada has already announced a resettlement program, it is important that evacuation efforts are not hampered due to bureaucratic red tape as the situation demands urgent action,"" said Danny Glenwright, the organization's president. Canadian officials said that about 300 Afghans have finished their quarantine and will eventually be resettled in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. In all, officials said Canada has evacuated about 1,700 people on 13 flights, which includes four that resumed as of this past Thursday after Canada and its allies managed to secure the Kabul airport after the Taliban took power the previous weekend. That also includes dozens of personnel from the 12 other countries participating in the American-led air bridge.

"2021-08-26","Full text: Pallister leaving future of bills to new premier BRANDON, Man. - Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister says he is prepared to be replaced within a matter of weeks and is leaving the fate of major education reforms and other proposed legislation in the hands of his successor. ""I'm working on the assumption that the (Progressive Conservative) executive council will make a decision to have a leadership vote at some point in the next few weeks,"" Pallister said Monday in his first comments to the media since he announced Aug. 10 that he would not seek re-election. The party executive was to meet Monday night to start laying out the rules and a date for a leadership convention. The only declared candidate so far, former health minister Heather Stefanson, has said she wants to scrap an education bill that would eliminate elected English-language school boards. The proposed legislation, which would also centralize governance of schools, has been widely criticized in Winnipeg and rural areas. There are other proposed laws that have yet to come to a final vote in the legislature, which is to reconvene Oct. 6. One aims to crack down on blockades of roads, rail lines and other infrastructure. Another would temporarily halt public regulatory hearings on electricity rates and allow the government to set rates unilaterally. A third would remove the automatic right to binding arbitration in labour disputes. Pallister said since he has declared his intention to resign, the fate of those bills is in the hands of the next premier. ""My successor will have the opportunity to take various changes to heart, as will the cabinet and caucus, as they always do."" The Manitoba School Boards Association said the uncertainty over education changes is creating anxiety. ""The longer this is dragged out in what has become a partisan political drama, the more damage it's doing to ... the mental state of everyone who is waiting to see what the future of public education is in this province,"" association president Alan Campbell said. Pallister had been hinting at retirement since last fall. He faced steep declines in opinion polls this year as Manitoba was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and some intensive care patients had to be shipped to other provinces. He created more controversy in July with comments about Canadian history. His Indigenous relations minister resigned two days later. Some of his caucus members distanced themselves from the premier's remarks — a noticeable break in normally tight Tory communications. Pallister was in a reflective mood Monday as he announced health care capital projects in Brandon, where he attended university, and Portage la Prairie, the city close to the farm where he grew up. Outside a hospital that is being replaced in Portage la Prairie, Pallister reminisced about his wife giving birth in the facility and about another relative who died there. He also looked back on his almost three decades in provincial and federal politics and said it was time to move on. ""I'm 67. I lost my sister last year — younger than me. You reflect,"" Pallister said. ""I know that there's a time for renewal and that time, in respect of my role, is upon us."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 23, 2021.

"2021-08-25","Full text: Green Party Leader Annamie Paul stressed the importance of Canada quickly reaching net-zero emissions at a press conference Friday, but critics say they want to see more details from the climate-focused party. The plan Paul outlined Friday afternoon includes protecting the natural environment, increasing renewables and electrification, tackling industrial emissions, and investing in innovation, but she did not offer specific targets or measures on the plan to curb emissions quickly. “We're focused this week on outlining the larger ideas, and we will be releasing more details about all of those elements, and more, later on,” Paul told Canada’s National Observer. Paul added the party is “not doing a complete detour” from positions outlined in the past, like advocating for 60 per cent greenhouse gas emission reductions below 2005 levels by 2030, cancelling all new pipeline projects (including TMX), ending all oil exploration projects, and investing in building retrofits and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. “We've never waited for an election to propose innovative ideas,” she said. Climate advocacy group 350.org’s Cam Fenton says the Greens are missing an opportunity to move the needle on climate change debates by not putting forward more “specific, bold policy ideas.” “So far, it seems like they're maybe not owning this moment in a way they could that would both help their party, and I think broadly be more of an effective conversation-mover on climate,” he said. Fenton said that with the Conservative Party’s platform including a price on carbon, climate advocates should be using the moment to strike while the iron’s hot. “We're no longer stuck in this climate debate about do we need a carbon tax or not … now we've got an opportunity to have a conversation about what are the 51 other things to close the gap on where we are on climate and where we need to be,” he said. “Part of the Greens’ reason for existing as a party is to force that conversation to happen, and I didn't get that impression from the press conference today that they're taking that kind of responsibility as seriously as I would hope.” Fenton also said the Green Party has a unique opportunity to push the climate file forward because the NDP has “internal conflicts it’s constantly battling.” The two major challenges, Fenton says, are that some of the party’s base comes from private sector unions who can be opposed to “keep it in the ground” climate messages, and the fossil fuel-friendly policies of two of the leading provincial NDP figures, B.C. Premier John Horgan and Alberta Opposition Leader Rachel Notley. “Jagmeet Singh is always playing a bit of a dance with not being completely offside with leading provincial figures in the party,” Fenton said. “The Greens don't have that, so they have the opportunity to be out front and unapologetically push the window. “But it does appear, and Annamie Paul has said this, (she) is trying to make the Green Party about more than just the environment and climate.” Paul defends the decision, saying that in a pandemic, it wouldn’t be possible to only talk about climate change. Moreover, it’s important for Canadians to know the Green Party is responsive to other issues, she says. “(Canadians) need to know we're a party that also has a plan on how to end the 17 deaths on average that are caused every day by drug poisoning; they need to know we have a plan for what happens after emergency benefits wrap up in terms of making sure that people don't fall through the cracks; they need to know we have a plan for affordable housing in this country,” said Paul.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Ministers defend Afghanistan evacuation efforts OTTAWA - Canada airlifted another 121 people from strife-ridden Afghanistan on Saturday, including Canadian citizens and family members as well as Afghan nationals accepted for resettlement by Ottawa and its allies, officials said Sunday. Canada will work tirelessly to evacuate people from Afghanistan ""for as long as it is safe to do so,"" Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told a news conference on the frantic effort. Sajjan said the challenging security conditions in Kabul are changing rapidly, even by the hour, but Canadian personnel are doing everything in their power to get people to safety. The crowding and violence around the Kabul airport continue to pose a ""major challenge"" for personnel, he added. On the election campaign trail Sunday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh criticized the Liberals for what he described as a sluggish effort to bring residents who previously supported Canada's diplomatic and military efforts to safety. Pressed on whether Canada was doing enough to get people through the airport gates and on to planes, Sajjan said he had to be circumspect about operational details for security reasons, adding various plans are under consideration. ""We're not discounting anything on what we need to do,"" he said. ""The security situation is extremely dire right now."" Sajjan was joined by Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino, Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau and Women and Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef. ""The stories coming out of Kabul are heartbreaking. People are scared. They fear for their lives, and they're taking significant risks to try to get to safety,"" Garneau said. ""The panic we see in emails and hear during phone calls really drives home the gravity of the situation. We are walking this difficult road with them, helping them step by step to get to safety."" Mendocino said Canadian personnel ""have the full operational discretion to take whatever actions are necessary to get as many people into the airport and onto those flights as quickly as possible."" ""I've instructed that processing be accelerated, resources be added and that all red tape be cut without compromising security."" He also offered assurances that Canada is in ""constant contact"" with everybody that has applied under its programs, providing direction on how to stay as safe as possible. Government officials confirmed on Saturday that Canadians had evacuated 106 Afghans from the Kabul airport on Friday and brought them to a safe third country. Friday's flight was Canada's second out of Kabul since Afghanistan fell to the Taliban last weekend. The first left Thursday, with 175 fleeing Afghans and 13 foreign nationals on board. Officials said the Afghans on Thursday's flight are bound for other countries, while the 106 on Friday's are destined for settlement in Canada. All of the Afghan evacuees on the first two flights were interpreters and other workers who supported Canada's military and diplomatic efforts in the country, they said. Monsef, the first Afghan-Canadian elected to Parliament, said the chaos in Kabul had stirred up difficult memories. She promised to work with colleagues in Canada and around the world to create space for the voices of Afghan women and girls and minorities. ""Their voices must be heard, they must shape Canada's response and the global response,"" she said. ""The Taliban are the same Taliban of 20 years ago.""

"2021-08-24","Full text: Today in History - Aug. 22 Today in History for Aug. 22: In 1485, King Richard III of England was killed at the ""Battle of Bosworth,"" ending the Wars of the Roses. Henry Tudor succeeded Richard to become King Henry VII. In 1711, thick fog thwarted an assault by British Admiral Walker on Quebec. Eight of 15 warships were wrecked and almost 900 men drowned. In 1776, Britain landed 10,000 men on Long Island in a bid to quash the American Revolution. In 1800, Edward Pusey, English biblical scholar and Tractarian spokesman, was born. He worked to establish religious orders in Anglicanism, founding in 1845 the first Anglican sisterhood. In 1827, industrialist Ezra Butler Eddy, who became known as the matchmaker of the world, was born in Vermont. E.B. Eddy moved his small friction-match factory from Burlington, Vt., to Hull, Que., in 1851. He expanded, modernized and diversified to produce a variety of wood and paper products. Eddy was also elected mayor of Hull six times and was a member of the Quebec legislature for six years. In 1846, the United States annexed New Mexico. In 1851, the schooner ""America"" outraced the ""Aurora"" off the English coast to win a silver trophy that came to be known as the America's Cup. In 1864, the International Red Cross was established in Geneva. The organization for the relief of suffering owes its founding to the Swiss banker Jean Henri Dunant. Moved and upset by the suffering he had witnessed at the battle of Solferino in 1859, Dunant urged the formation of a voluntary aid society and initiated planning of the Red Cross. In 1884, the Calgary Agricultural Society, forerunner of the Calgary Stampede, was organized. Billed as ""The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth,"" the first exhibition took place in 1886 and the world-famous Stampede rodeo began in 1912, instigated by Guy Weadick, an American trick roper. In 1910, Japan annexed Korea, which remained under Japanese colonial rule until 1945. In 1914, Canada's War Measures Act received royal assent. In 1922, Irish revolutionary Michael Collins was shot to death, apparently by Irish Republican Army members who were opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty that Collins had co-signed. In 1933, the Liberals under Angus Lewis Macdonald gained power in a Nova Scotia election. In 1935, the Social Credit swept into power in Alberta, led by William Aberhart. The founder of the Prophetic Bible Institute in Calgary gained a wide audience through his weekly religious broadcasts on a province-wide radio network. He espoused the economic theories of Scottish engineer Clifford Douglas, who believed that conventional capitalism would founder because private control of credit would cut mass purchasing power. Aberhart died in office in 1943, but his party retained power in Alberta until 1971, when it lost to the Progressive Conservatives under Peter Lougheed. In 1943, the Communist Party of Canada, banned under the War Measures Act, became the Labour-Progressive Party. In 1950, the first Canada-wide railway strike involving 17 unions paralyzed rail and telegraph service. About 125,000 railroad and telegraph workers walked off their jobs, causing one of the most serious transportation crises in Canadian history. The strike ended Aug. 30, when Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent's government passed back-to-work legislation. In 1950, Althea Gibson became the first black tennis player to be accepted in competition for the U.S. national championship. In 1968, Pope Paul VI arrived in Bogota, Colombia, on the first-ever papal visit to Latin America. In 1978, a record-setting 97 misprints appeared in five-and-a-half column inches of ""The London Times"" article on Pope Paul VI. In 1979, former prime minister John Diefenbaker was buried on the University of Saskatchewan campus in Saskatoon. In 1985, 55 people died when fire broke out aboard a British Airtours charter jet on a runway at Manchester Airport in England. In 1989, Black Panthers co-founder Huey P. Newton was shot to death in Oakland, Calif. Gunman Tyrone Robinson was later sentenced to 32 years to life in prison. In 1991, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the rape shield law, which said the previous sexual conduct of a rape victim could not be used in court. In 2001, tests on a dead crow found near Windsor, Ont., confirmed the first case of a bird carrying the West Nile virus in Canada. In 2003, more than 24,000 residents of Kelowna, B.C., nearly one-third of the population, were driven from their homes by a forest fire that was started by lightning. It eventually destroyed 248 homes in outlying neighbourhoods. In 2003, a rocket exploded on its launch pad while undergoing pre-launch tests, killing 16 people, mostly civilian technicians, at the Alcantara space base in northeastern Brazil. In 2008, Ontario health officials announced an outbreak of dangerous listeriois after a positive connection was made between confirmed cases across Canada and a recall of deli meats produced at a Maple Leaf Foods plant in Toronto. The outbreak claimed 22 lives across Canada. In 2008, Usain Bolt helped Jamaica win the men's 4x100-metre relay final in 37.10 seconds for his third gold medal and third world record of the Beijing Olympics. (In 2017, the Jamaican team was stripped of the medal over a doping case involving teammate Nesta Carter.) (In 2012 at the London Olympics, Jamaica, anchored by Bolt, won the gold and set a new world record at 36.84 seconds.) In 2009, legendary Nova Scotia peace activist Muriel Duckworth, best known as one of the founding members of the national peace group Voice of Women, died in Magog, Que., at age 100. Duckworth co-founded a variety of social action groups and played crucial roles in several humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam Canada, where she served on the board of directors in the 1970s. In 2009, Cpl. Darby Morin, 25, from Big River First Nation in northern Saskatchewan, a soldier serving with the U.S. army, was killed when his vehicle rolled over while he was serving in Afghanistan. In 2011, federal NDP Leader Jack Layton died after a battle with cancer, just months after leading his party to an unprecedented 103 seats in the May 2 federal election. He was 61. His death came a month after he appeared at a news conference, looking frail and gaunt, to announce he was suffering from a new, unspecified cancer and would temporarily step down as head of the official Opposition. Layton's death touched off an extraordinary outpouring of national grief. People set up makeshift memorials at his Toronto home and constituency office and thousands filed by to pay their respects after Layton's flag-draped coffin was carried into Parliament on Aug. 24 and lay in state for two days. A state funeral was held in Toronto on Aug. 27. In 2015, 11 people were killed when a vintage jet fighter slammed onto a highway after it failed to pull out of a loop manoeuvre during the Shoreham Airshow in southern England, plowing through cars on the road and exploding in a huge fireball. In 2018, Ohio State suspended superstar football coach Urban Meyer for three games for mishandling repeated professional and behavioural problems of an assistant coach. Investigators found Meyer protected his protege for years through domestic violence allegations, a drug problem and poor job performance before the coach was fired the previous month. In 2020, the global death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 800,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Telegraph service; West Nile virus; Prime ministers; Rape"

"2021-08-23","Full text: Manitoba premier facing retirement 'under siege' WINNIPEG - Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister's decades-long career in politics is not ending quietly. Low opinion polls and opposition within his own caucus as he heads toward retirement have raised doubts about how graceful an exit he will make and whether some of his promised changes will be enacted. ""The premier's under siege,"" says Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba. ""There's also the fact that more and more ministers are looking at their prospects to become the next leader and premier, and so that dynamic is at work."" Pallister announced Aug. 10 that he would not seek re-election and asked the Progressive Conservative party to start moving toward a leadership convention. Pallister did not say when he plans to step down and has not answered media questions since. The party is to set a date soon for picking a new leader, as well as outline rules and entry fees for the race. At that point, Pallister is expected to decide whether to stay on until his replacement is chosen or leave sooner. The first candidate, veteran Tory caucus member Heather Stefanson, promised this week to kill a bill now before the legislature that would eliminate elected school boards and centralize education decision-making. Her campaign has the backing of roughly two-thirds of the caucus, and her promise to stop the education reforms was applauded by many standing around her, including Education Minister Cliff Cullen who put forward the bill. ""That's created a real political mess for the governing party, and there's no easy way for them to extract themselves,"" Thomas said. While the education bill has attracted the most attention — there are lawn signs across the province in protest and hundreds of people have signed up to speak against it before a legislature committee — there are other proposed laws that have yet to come to a final vote in the legislature. One would make it easier for police to remove blockades of roads, rail lines and other infrastructure. Another would temporarily halt public regulatory hearings on electricity rates and allow the government to set rates unilaterally. A third would remove the automatic right to binding arbitration in labour disputes. The Tories have a few options going forward, Thomas said. Pallister could leave soon, have an interim leader appointed and have that person determine whether to go forward with the current agenda. Pallister could also voluntarily withdraw some of the bills if he stays on longer, or try to push them through if he is willing to test caucus support. He could also seek to prorogue the legislature to end the current session that is set to resume Oct. 6. That would kill all bills that have not yet been passed and allow a new leader to start with a fresh slate. The problem with the third scenario is that the government has yet to pass its omnibus budget bill that is required to enact some changes announced in the fiscal plan last spring. They include removing the provincial sales tax from haircuts and salon services. In the more immediate future, Cullen — and possibly other cabinet ministers — may decide to quit if they are truly opposed to the education bill, Thomas said. ""Ministers who can't go along with major government policy should probably resign."" Pallister has already lost some of his inner circle. Stefanson resigned as health minister so she could begin her leadership campaign. And Eileen Clarke resigned from the Indigenous relations portfolio last month over comments Pallister made about Canadian history that were widely condemned by Indigenous leaders.

"2021-08-23","Full text: The University of Sudbury is anxiously waiting on a commitment from the provincial government to gain access to federal funds that would allow the school to become an independent Francophone institution. The federal minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, Mélanie Joly, announced a $121.3 million investment over three years to support post-secondary minority-language education last week. This historic announcement acknowledges the importance of providing government funding to Francophone universities that would not otherwise be able to survive in the current economic and social climate, said a University of Sudbury release. But to gain access to these funds, the university needs the provincial government to agree to spend “a small sum” to administer the funds. “We want part of that money to flow through the community,” said University of Sudbury president Serge Miville. “If we don’t act on this, Sudbury is going to miss out on millions of dollars that would be put towards Francophone post-secondary education.” Laurentian University sought protection under the federal Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) in February 2020. As part of the insolvency proceedings, a total of 100 professors were dismissed and over 60 programs were cut. Laurentian also cut ties and shared funding with the University of Sudbury, Huntington University and Thorneloe University. The University of Sudbury said these cuts have disproportionately affected French-language courses. As a result, the school announced its intention to become an independent institution run “by and for” the Franco-Ontarian community. The university developed a 53-page business plan that details what a comprehensive, publicly assisted French-language university institution would look like in Sudbury with the intention of welcoming students this fall. But its funding pipeline, which ran through Laurentian University, was cut off during the insolvency proceedings. The university has written two letters to the provincial Ministry of Colleges and Universities to discuss its options moving forward, but both of them have so far gone unanswered. Miville said it’s “curious and worrying” that the province isn’t jumping on this opportunity because inaction will be really devastating to the Francophone community in northern Ontario. “Normally, when the federal government earmarks money like this, the provincial government needs to match up to 50 per cent,” he said. “This is different. We’re talking about administrative fees over a period of three years which are trivial at best. That’s a few hundred thousand dollars which would allow us to have access to vital federal funds.” This is almost a risk-free opportunity for the province, he added. “If Minister Jill Dunlop does not get into contact with the federal government to sign this agreement before Oct. 14, then these earmarked funds for French-language postsecondary education will not flow to Sudbury,” he said. “We need to find a way to reassure parents, students, stakeholders, the community and Sudbury at large that we’re still an important destination for post-secondary education and that funding would really help send that message.” Miville said the University of Sudbury remains optimistic because it has a credible plan going forward, and its talks with civil servants have so far been productive. “Whenever I speak to civil servants, they are incredibly enthusiastic but there’s a silence from the minister’s side,” he said. “But we do have a really good plan, and our heart is in the right spot. Now, there’s this huge influx of money that could come in which wouldn’t require a massive investment from the province, so all the boxes are being checked right now.” The University of Sudbury still hopes to welcome students in the future, but it is the technical details standing in the way. “Every university program needs to be accredited. We had our accreditations, and part of our letter was sort of asking do we still have our accreditation now that we’re an independent French-language university?” said Miville. “We are waiting on that answer. We sent that question a few weeks ago now, so the more time that passes where we don’t have a concrete answer, the less we can offer students.” Students have been asking to transfer to the university, but unless the ministry recognizes the programs that have already been accredited, Miville doesn’t want to risk students’ futures by giving them the go-ahead. “Fortunately, though, we are not starting from nowhere. Once we get the green light from the ministry, we will be able to hit the ground running,” he said. “We are also looking to expand the university’s offering. We want to have something to recognize the really important issues in our community.” Part of this will be programming that attracts students back to Sudbury. “We’re estimating that each student that’s leaving, it’s around $30,000 a year that leaves the city. If you start counting, that really adds up,” he said. “I am worried about the economy of our region, and we want to make sure we have a value-added service to make sure we can train a bilingual workforce.” Miville said that the University of Sudbury plans to make its status an issue in the Sept. 20 federal election. “I am very happy to say that I am going to be meeting every single candidate of the major parties, and I want them to know what our perspective is for the future of the community,” he said. “This is not a partisan issue. This is a Sudbury issue. This is a Northern Ontario issue. We keep saying that our communities are shrinking. I really want to be a force to turn that around. This is a local issue that has a national impact.” The Local Journalism Initiative is made possible through funding from the federal government. sud.editorial@sunmedia.ca Twitter: @SudburyStar"

Singh set the tone on Friday by making the campaign's first stop at a First Nation. Singh visited the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan, where leaders recently announced preliminary findings of 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school. Singh's emotional response at the site forced the other two leaders to defend their own parties' record on Indigenous issues. Both Trudeau and O'Toole had been making their own announcements -- Trudeau with a promise for 10 sick days for federally regulated employees and O'Toole with a plan to encourage employers to rehire workers idled by the pandemic. Trudeau met with three Manitoba chiefs on Friday after his government last week committed $321 million in new funding for programs to help Indigenous communities search burial sites at former residential schools and support survivors. Grand Chief Arlen Dumas of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said it was a ""good gesture,"" but more resources would be needed to address the problem. Dumas said in an interview that he had a good, but brief, conversation with Trudeau about the First Nations-led response to COVID-19 in Manitoba and the continued work needed on water and housing issues on reserves.

"2021-08-23","Full text: A Resort Village of Candle Lake resident is wondering why he saw a large increase in his property taxes this year. Borden Wasyluk, who previously served as mayor of Candle Lake, claims that he saw a a 38 per cent tax increase on his two properties which led his actual bill go up by around $900. According to documents at the Village of Candle Lake website, the Mill Rate stayed the same in 2021 as it did in 2020 at three mills. The mill rate factor residential decreased from 1.12 in 2020 to 1 in 2021, the commercial factor increases from 1.44 to 2.12, the base tax residential increases from $325 to $650 and the base tax commercial increased from $425 to $845. This will result in an increase in Tax Levy Revenue from $2,251,092.00 in 2020 to $2,714,124.00 in 2021. The early payment discount rate was set at five per cent, which was a decrease from 20 per cent the previous year. Wasyluk's complaint was about the increase in the base tax, but he also didn’t like how frontage was not taken into account in calculations. “The thing about the base tax is it's very very unfair,” he said. “You get into the industrial area where the sizes of the property vary and there is probably people with 1,000 frontage feet and those with 50, 60 frontage feet and the base tax went up $850 on the lot, So the amount of frontage feet you have has not been taken into account and I just don't understand how everybody can be treated the same that way. “Nine hundred and some dollars, in my case, it's for two separate properties, but that's ludicrous. The fact is that the base tax is not properly placed. Why should a guy with the 50 foot lot frontage pay the same as somebody with 1,000? Let's get it by frontage foot. Let's be fair about this.” Current Mayor Terry Kostyna rejected the idea that the process was unfair. He said it was about providing the same basic service to everyone. “We are a large geographic area—being some 30 kilometres from one end to the other and physically the size of Prince Albert. Along with the number of properties that factors into all of the challenges, we felt that we needed to provide that level of service to everybody and it's a basic thing.” In the budget speech posted on the Village's website, it was noted that the prior five years reduction in taxes created a shortfall in revenue necessary for daily operations and municipal infrastructure maintenance. This was the rationale for moving back to the 2016 tax rates. In documents, the Village stated that there has been a significant reduction in taxes resulting in a shortfall in revenue required for necessary daily operations and repairs to municipal infrastructure. ”We needed to get to a balanced budget and it was determined the base tax component was necessary to get to that balanced budget,” Kostyma explained. “We simply felt that the simplest easiest way was just to go back to 2016 (tax levels).” Wasyluk said that for the majority of his term, council lowered taxes and decreased the base tax rate. “I think the base tax initially was not fair and if they were going to increase it, which they did, then treat it fairly go frontage foot or something like that. We're not all the same. We don't come out of the same mould,” Wasyluk said. In their budget documents, council noted that tax reductions compounded by uncommon and unrealistic discounts over the last four and previous years have resulted in too many things just simply left undone or not planned for. Frontage was not addressed by council because it wasn't available to communities. “There are a limited number of tools provided by the municipalities act and frontage isn't one of them,” Kostyma said. They said that decision were not made by previous councils served to kick the can down the road and created a problem that needed to be dealt with. The community also adjusted the early payment discount rate and lowered it to five per cent which they say lines up with other communities in the province. “It's a retirement community, basically, but a lot of the new homes built built are either for future retirement homes or they are retirement homes. Candle Lake is a retirement community basically,” Wasyluk said. Wasyluk also wondered what the tax increase would be used for. Before the COVID-19 pandemic the community held subdivision meetings. He wants to see subdivision by subdivision meetings, or two or three , meetings at a time depending, on the size of the subdivision. Kosyma explained that council is still working on a new ways to better communicate with residents. In the meantime, they’ve introcuded a new newsletter, and a new Facebook page. “The uptake on those has been great and positive,” Kosyma said. “We are working on the plan for further engagement with the community, and all of those things will be considered.” Kosyma added that COVID was one of the reason there was no subdivision meetings this year out of caution. “We have to be careful when we look around the rest of the world,” he said. Wasyluk was unphased, and said it’s time for elected officials to listen to the community. “If you want consultants, your taxpayers should be your consultants,” Wasyluk said, Wasyluk said previous councils worked hard to decrease taxes four years in a row. He said the community was well off and he could not foresee any imminent plans. “But we're not broke. We're not a pauper community,” Wasyluk said. Kostyma wondered why Wasyluk had reached out to the media as opposed to calling him personally as his phone number is available on the resort village's website. Kostyma also observed that generally the 2021 budget received positive reviews, even when it was hotly debated on social media. The Village of Candle Lake is also implementing a 5-year capital and asset management plan according to Kosyma. “We are creating a five year capital and operations plan, which to my knowledge hadn't happened previously. We feel that's really important to be planning and thinking ahead,” Kosyma said. Wasyluk was defeated by Kosyma in the most recent election in 2020.

"2021-08-22","Full text: --- (FedElxn-Liberals) (Audio:P10) Justin Trudeau says if the Liberals are re-elected, they would introduce 10 days of paid sick leave for federally regulated workers. At a campaign event in Winnipeg this morning, the Liberal leader said he also wants to work with lower levels of government so everyone qualifies for paid sick leave. The Liberals had previously introduced three days of paid personal leave for federally regulated workers. (10) --- (FedElxn-Conservatives) (Audio:P11) Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole was in Winnipeg today, highlighting a promised hiring incentive in his party's platform. O'Toole says the Tories are the only party with a plan to recover the millions of jobs lost over the course of the pandemic. The Conservative leader also said he believes doctors must refer patients seeking services like abortion or medical assistance in dying to another provider if they object to performing these procedures themselves. O'Toole had faced questions about his position on conscience rights for health professionals after a promise to uphold them appeared in his party's election platform. (10) --- (Cda-Afghanistan) (Audio:P08) Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino says his department will accelerate the processing of the families of interpreters and those who supported Canada's mission in Afghanistan to quickly evacuate as many approved people as possible. Mendicino says the government is not requiring passports or negative COVID-19 tests from Afghan evacuees, and is deferring biometric screening to a third country. At a campaign stop in Winnipeg this morning, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau sought to assure that the government is doing everything it can to get people to safety. (10) --- (Wildfires-BC) A cooler, showery weekend is forecast for most of British Columbia, potentially offering reprieve to exhausted crews battling more than 250 active wildfires in all corners of the province. Those include the first significant fire of the season on Vancouver Island, where the Cowichan Valley Regional District has declared a state of local emergency covering an area west of Ladysmith after a fire was sparked yesterday. No homes are threatened by the estimated 20-hectare blaze, but an evacuation order has been posted for some natural gas infrastructure operated by Fortis-B-C in a rural area northwest of the town. (10) --- (COVID-Border) The United States has extended its restrictions on non-essential travel at land and ferry border crossings until September 21st. It's the first such extension since Canada welcomed vaccinated Americans back into the country earlier in the month. Canada currently allows U-S citizens and permanent residents into the country, provided they've been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The U-S does allow Canadians to fly across the border for non-essential purposes. (10) --- (Film-Sweet-Girl) Jason Momoa doesn't get to play many ordinary guys, which he says is part of the reason he wanted to be in ``Sweet Girl'' -- a new action drama that's now available on Netflix. In the film he's an ordinary Pittsburgh father named Ray Cooper who vows to get revenge against a pharmaceutical company he blames for his wife's death. As a father himself, Momoa says it was a natural fit, and he got to hand-pick the actress who'd play his daughter: ``Instant Family's'' Isabela Merced. (10)"

"2021-09-22","Full text: --- (FedElxn-Campaign) New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh will make the federal election's first stop in an Indigenous community when he visits Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan today. The community made a preliminary finding of 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school in June. Meanwhile, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and his Conservative counterpart Erin O'Toole converge in Winnipeg today. On Thursday, the leaders battled over the right prescription to help the country's health-care systems and how much more funding provinces require to meet their needs during and after the pandemic. (6) --- (FedElxn-Indigenous) (Audio:P05) Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B-C Indian Chiefs says the Trudeau Liberals garnered his community's support when elected in 2015 -- but this year could be different. Phillip says Indigenous people's fundamental priorities include addressing the climate crisis, ending boil-water advisories and implementing calls to action from both the Truth and Reconciliation commission and the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls inquiry. He says the lack of progress on many of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action is a clear example of how the Liberals didn't deliver on their promises to Indigenous Peoples. (6) --- (COVID-Poll) (Audio:P02) The latest survey conducted by Leger suggests a majority of Canadians would support a proof of vaccination system to access some non-essential services. Seventy-six per cent of respondents to the poll say they would strongly or somewhat support a vaccine passport like the one Quebec is implementing. Quebecers are even more supportive of the measure, with 81 per cent saying they're in favour of the plan, despite a weekend protest that drew thousands to the streets of downtown Montreal. They were calling for Premier Francois Legault to reverse his decision and hold a debate on the matter. (6) --- (Wildfires-BC) The B-C Wildfire Service has expressed concern over fatigue among personnel battling the blazes. Operations manager Todd Nessman says they are seeing more slips, trips, falls and other serious incidents, and the situation is being monitored to make sure firefighters are safe.

Terrified that the new de facto rulers would commit such abuses, thousands have raced to Kabul's airport. Others have taken to the streets to protest the takeover, and Taliban fighters have violently suppressed those demonstrations.

"2021-0 8-22","Full text: Muslim charity wants court to freeze suspension OTTAWA - A Muslim charity is asking a court to freeze a federal suspension, which prohibits it from issuing tax receipts, while a challenge of the penalty plays out. Ottawa-based Human Concern International says the one-year suspension levied last month will cause ""irreparable harm"" to the organization and thousands of beneficiaries. The Canada Revenue Agency penalized HCI following an audit by the agency's charities directorate that flagged concerns about six initiatives. The agency accused the charity of improperly issuing donation receipts totalling more than US$307,000 on behalf of organizations administering the six projects — a practice known as third-party receipting. The initiatives included three education and health projects in India, education and skills development of orphans in Bangladesh, orphan support in Somalia and an education project in Kenya. HCI says Canadian charities often work with individuals and groups connected to the communities where the projects are taking place. The charity insists it has always been committed to maintaining direction and control of its overseas projects and to ensuring that all such projects conducted through third-party intermediaries constitute HCI's own charitable activities. In a July 7 letter to HCI, the revenue agency disagreed with the charity's interpretation, saying it was unable to accept the assertion that the six unregistered organizations were third-party fundraisers acting on behalf of, and for the benefit of, HCI. The resulting one-year suspension is in effect until July 13, 2022. HCI has objected to the penalty through the revenue agency's internal administrative appeal process. At the same time, it applied to the federal Tax Court to delay the application of the suspension until the objection was dealt with. Early this month a federal Tax Court judge ruled against providing a stay of the suspension. HCI is now challenging the refusal in the Federal Court of Appeal, arguing in a submission this week the judge failed to observe a principle of natural justice and procedural fairness in not giving HCI the right to a trial before punishment. HCI, which is responding to the recent earthquake in Haiti, wants to ensure donors' charitable dollars will continue to help, said Mahmuda Khan, the charity's executive director. ""Whether it is a bakery in Yemen that serves vulnerable families in a war zone, supporting orphans or offering education to young girls, the suspension significantly risks this important work."" HCI's charitable work continues, notwithstanding the court's decision, but the reality is the charity ""will have to scale back some of its programs,"" Khan added. Almost 100 Muslim organizations and civil society groups sent a letter last month to Justin Trudeau calling on him to reform the revenue agency's auditing practices, alleging they unfairly target Muslim charities. The groups also asked the Liberal government, which has since triggered an election campaign, to overturn the agency's decision to suspend HCI. Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier agreed during a national summit on Islamophobia last month to ask the taxpayers' ombudsperson, François Boileau, for a systemic review of the concerns. Boileau said he is committed to examining the issues and will provide the government with an update on his investigation by Jan. 1.

"2021-09-21","Full text: Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B-C Indian Chiefs says the Trudeau Liberals enjoyed enormous Indigenous support when they were first elected in 2015. But Phillip says things could different this time around. He says Justin Trudeau made all the right promises about improving the lives of Indigenous people back in 2015, but the government didn't follow through. As Phillip put it -- Trudeau was ""long on sizzle and short on substance."" He says Indigenous people have certain fundamental priorities that must be addressed during the current election campaign. They include the climate crisis, implementing the Truth and Reconciliation and the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls committees' calls to action, and also ending drinking water advisories. The lack of progress on many of the T-R-C's calls to action was highlighted in May after what are believed to be the graves of 215 children were found at the site of a residential school in Kamloops, B-C.

"2021-08-22","Full text: TORONTO - Ontario Premier Doug Ford says elected officials must lead by example when it comes to COVID-19 vaccinations. Late yesterday afternoon, Ford removed Chatham-Kent-Leamington M-P-P Rick Nicholls from the governing Progressive Conservative caucus. Nicholls also won't be allowed to seek re-election as a Tory candidate after the premier said he failed to provide a legitimate reason for not getting vaccinated. Nicholls and Scarborough Centre M-P-P Christina Mitas (MY'-tahs) were both given a deadline of 5 p.m. yesterday to show proof of vaccination or a medical exemption. Mitas provided a doctor's letter. Nicholls told a news conference earlier yesterday that he made a personal choice not to get vaccinated, telling reporters that no Ontarian should be forced or coerced to do something against their will. The province also announced yesterday that Ontario Public Service employees would need to be regularly tested if they aren't fully vaccinated. Identifier / keyword: National"

"2021-08-22","Full text: Today in Music History - Aug. 20 Today in Music History for Aug. 20: In 1920, the first commercial radio station in the United States, 8-MK in Detroit, began daily broadcasting. The station later became WWJ. In 1924, Jim Reeves, billed as the country singer with the velvet touch, was born in Galloway, Texas. He was responsible as much as anybody for the marrying of country and pop music in the late 1950s. Although his first hit, ""Mexican Joe"" in 1952, was a country novelty record, Reeves' later successes were country only in the lyrics -- the backing was strictly pop. Hits such as ""Four Walls,"" ""He'll Have to Go"" and ""Am I Losing You"" were in the forefront of the Nashville Sound, which blended his mellow voice with lush orchestrations and vocal choruses. RCA Victor continued to release new Jim Reeves recordings months - and even years - after his death in a plane crash on July 31, 1964. In 1930, pianist Mario Bernardi, the first conductor of The National Arts Centre Orchestra, was born in Kirkland Lake, Ont. Bernardi became conductor of the newly formed orchestra in 1968. He was named music director of the National Arts Centre three years later. In 1942, Isaac Hayes was born in Covington, Tenn., near Memphis. He played with R&B legends Booker T and Otis Redding while collaborating with songwriter David Porter on over 200 songs including Sam and Dave's ""Soul Man."" His 1969 album ""Hot Buttered Soul"" including the single ""Walk On By"" stayed on pop charts for over 80 weeks. Hayes' career-defining moment came with his theme song to the 1971 film ""Shaft"" which won him an Academy Award for Best Musical Score. Since 1990, Hayes appeared in various movies, although his most memorable character was ""Chef"" on the raunchy TV show ""South Park."" Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. He died Aug. 10, 2008. In 1948, Robert Plant, lead singer for heavy-metal pioneers ""Led Zeppelin,"" was born in Bromwich, England. Plant and drummer John Bonham had played together in a band called ""Bundle of Joy,"" and were invited in 1968 by guitarist Jimmy Page to join ""The New Yardbirds,"" which became ""Led Zeppelin"" the following year. The band's debut album, recorded in less than two days, made the top-10. Their second LP did even better, topping the charts, and every ""Led Zeppelin"" album that followed sold at least one million copies. By 1975, ""Led Zeppelin"" was the most popular rock band in the world. Their hits, such as ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""Stairway to Heaven,"" are still played regularly on rock radio stations. Plant's 1988 solo album, ""Now and Zen,"" was a big success. ""Raising Sand,"" his collaboration with bluegrass-country singer Alison Krauss, won Album of the Year at the 2009 Grammys. In 1960, Connie Francis began work on her first movie, ""Where the Boys Are."" She also starred in the sequel, ""When the Boys Meet the Girls."" In 1967, the New York Times reported on a new noise-reduction system for album and tape recording developed by R. and D-W Dolby. First used by a subsidiary of Elektra Records, the Dolby noise reduction system became the industry standard. In 1969, Frank Zappa disbanded ""The Mothers of Invention"" following an eight-day Canadian tour during which he said people clapped ""for all the wrong reasons."" Zappa reformed ""The Mothers of Invention"" a year later. In 1976, Gordon Lightfoot's ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,"" about an ore carrier that sank on Lake Superior, was released as a single. The song, from the album ""Summertime Dream,"" made it to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1981, Bruce Springsteen, Pat Benatar and other top rock stars performed at a benefit for Vietnam War veterans at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. In 1988, two people were crushed to death and two others seriously injured during ""The Monsters of Rock"" heavy metal festival at Donington Park Race Track in central England. About 80,000 fans had turned up for the event, headlined by ""Iron Maiden."" In 1988, steel guitarist Leon McAuliffe, who composed ""Steel Guitar Rag"" and co-wrote the classic ""San Antonio Rose,"" died in Tulsa, Okla., following a lengthy illness. He was 71. McAuliffe played with ""Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys"" from 1935-42, then formed his own western swing band after the Second World War. In 1989, about 20,000 people ended a week-long 20th anniversary celebration of the Woodstock Festival at the festival's original site near Bethel, NY. They left behind a mountain of mud and empty beer cans. The unsanctioned gathering had only one serious incident - a stabbing. Folksinger Melanie was the only Woodstock veteran to show up. She performed from a makeshift stage. In 1991, Freedom Williams of the dance music act ""C & C Music Factory"" fell face down in front of 2,500 fans at a show in Tucson, Ariz. His tape-recorded voice continued rapping and the crowd cheered, thinking the fall was part of the act. Williams spent a couple of days in hospital recovering from dehydration and exhaustion. In 1992, Sting and his longtime girlfriend, actress and TV producer Trudie Styler, were married in a civil ceremony in London. The couple already had three children, ages eight, seven and two. In 1994, police in Birmingham, Ala., arrested rapper Luther Campbell and eight dancers as they ran from a nightclub after a performance that included simulated sex acts. Campbell was charged with inciting to riot. The dancers, four women and four men, were charged with obscene, lewd and indecent conduct. In 1996, the ""Sex Pistols"" faced a hostile crowd in Toronto when they played a club gig sponsored by a beer company. Disappointed concert-goers threw beer and flicked cigarettes on stage, prompting lead singer John Lydon to threaten one offender - ""You're as dead as Jerry Garcia."" In 1999, bassist Bobby Sheehan of ""Blues Traveler"" was found dead of a drug overdose in his apartment in New Orleans. He was 31. In 1999, musician Fatboy Slim married British TV personality Zoe Ball in London. They separated in 2003 but later reconciled. In 2000, ""Bon Jovi"" was the last musical act to play at London's Wembley Stadium before it closed. In 2001, Celine Dion and her husband Rene Angelil sued Quebec weekly ""Allo-Vedettes"" and a reporter for publishing a gossip column that said she likes to sunbathe topless. In 2009, Larry Knechtel, a Grammy award-winning keyboard artist who accompanied leading musicians and combos from Elvis Presley and Ray Charles to Elvis Costello and the ""Dixie Chicks,"" died at age 69. He earned a Grammy award for his arrangement of ""Simon and Garfunkel's"" ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" and played keyboard on the ""Dixie Chicks'"" Grammy award-winning album ""Taking the Long Way."" In 2010, Charles Haddon, lead singer of the British pop trio ""Ou Est Le Swimming Pool,"" climbed a telecommunications mast behind the main stage after performing at the Pukkelpop festival in Hasselt, Belgium, and leaped to his death in the parking lot below. In 2010, singer Wyclef Jean's high-profile bid for Haiti's presidency ended after election officials on the earthquake-ravaged Caribbean nation disqualified his candidacy, possibly because he had not lived in Haiti for the past five years as required. In 2011, Ross Barbour, the last original member of ""The Four Freshmen,"" died of lung cancer at his home outside Los Angeles. He was 82. He died just three months after another founding member, his cousin Bob Flanigan. Brian Wilson cited the vocal group as a major influence on the harmonies of ""The Beach Boys.""

"2021-08-22","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Aug. 20 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 20 ... What we are watching in Canada ... TORONTO — A majority of Canadians support a system that would require proof of vaccination to access some non-essential services, a new poll suggests as the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic takes hold. Seventy-six per cent of respondents to the survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies said they would strongly or somewhat support a vaccine passport like the one Quebec is implementing. Quebecers are even more supportive of the measure, with 81 per cent saying they are in favour of the plan, which will apply in places like bars, concerts and festivals where there are lots of people in a confined space. That's despite a weekend rally that drew thousands of protesters to the streets of downtown Montreal, calling for Premier Francois Legault to reverse his decision and hold a debate on the matter. The questions around vaccine passports come as the poll suggests optimism over the pandemic is waning, said Andrew Enns, executive vice-president of Leger. ""I look at these numbers, and I get the feeling Canadians are starting to feel a little bit uncertain in terms of where the pandemic is heading,"" he said, pointing to tracking the Leger has done of people who believe the worst of the pandemic is over. ""That number has been dropping now for the better part of a month."" In the latest round of data, 44 per cent of people said they felt the worst of the pandemic had already past. That's down from a high of roughly 70 per cent in late June. Enns attributed that to the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19, which is fuelling the fourth wave of the pandemic. --- Also this ... The federal election campaign will converge in Winnipeg today, where leaders of the two largest parties will be holding events. Both Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and his Conservative counterpart Erin O'Toole will appear in the Manitoba capital for public events and to take questions from reporters. New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh will make the campaign's first stop at an Indigenous community when he visits the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan — a community which made a preliminary finding of 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school. Singh plans to visit the gravesites. On Thursday, the leaders battled over the right prescription to help the country's health-care systems and how much more funding provinces require to meet their needs during and after the pandemic. O'Toole said he would boost federal funding for provincially run health-care systems by six per cent annually. Speaking in French at a stop in Ottawa, O'Toole left the door open to offering more money if the national economy grows faster than expected, which would give federal coffers extra cash to potentially splash around. Speaking in Victoria, B.C., where he outlined plans to improve wages and conditions in long-term care facilities, Trudeau said the country needs to invest more in health care and that his government would be there to increase provincial transfers, although he did not detail when or by how much. Singh took aim at Trudeau over the Liberal government's track record on health-care spending during a campaign stop in Edmonton where he highlighted his party's pledge for a $250 million fund to help train and hire 2,000 nurses. --- And this ... VANCOUVER — The B-C Wildfire Service is getting concerned about fatigue setting in on the fire lines. Operations manager Todd Nessman says they are seeing more slips, trips, falls and other serious incidents and the situation is being monitored to make sure firefighters are safe. There are currently about 3,800 firefighters from B-C and more than 500 others from out of province on the fire lines. But some will be returning to school shortly, so that number will drop. More than 8,500 square kilometres of land has burned since the fire season started on April 1st. Crews are currently battling about 290 fires and there are more than 70 evacuation orders in effect along with some 120 evacuation alerts. The B-C government earmarked 136-million-dollars for this year's wildfire season, down from the nearly 650-million it spent in 2017. But Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth insists the province will spend what it has to on fighting the wildfires, adding ""Money is not the issue.'' --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... WASHINGTON — U.S. officials are struggling to speed the pace of evacuations of Americans and Afghans at the Kabul airport. In a hopeful sign, the State Department said it expected a major increase in the number to be airlifted soon. But obstacles remain, including Taliban checkpoints and paperwork problems. With an Aug. 31 deadline looming, tens of thousands remain to be airlifted to safety. As of Thursday, about 7,000 people had been evacuated in the U.S. airlift, including about 2,000 on each of the past two days. The State Department said it expects another 6,000 to be flown out soon. --- Also this ... LOS ANGELES — California’s wildfires have already made plenty of news this summer and the worst may be yet to come. Some of the state’s most devastating fires have started in the fall when powerful, dry winds blow out of the desert. More land has burned this year than at the same point last year, which set the record for most acreage charred. The largest fire currently burning is the second-largest in state history. Most of the large fires have been in the northern half of the state. But the biggest fires in Southern California have usually been sparked in September or later in the year. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... TULUM, Mexico — Hurricane Grace has been temporarily knocked back to tropical storm force, but it's expected to regain hurricane strength Friday as it heads for a second landfall in Mexico. This time it's taking aim at the mainland’s Gulf coast after crashing through the country’s main tourist strip. The storm lost punch as it zipped across the Yucatan Peninsula, but it is regaining energy over the Gulf of Mexico. The forecast would take it toward a coastal region of small fishing towns and beach resorts tonight or early Saturday. Then it would head over over a mountain range toward the heart of the country. --- On this day in 1992 ... The federal government, provinces, territories and the four major aboriginal groups in Canada reached unanimous agreement on native self-government at constitutional talks in Ottawa.--- In entertainment ... LONDON — Sandra Oh has been dancing with death on “Killing Eve” since 2018, so she could do with a laugh. That’s one of the reasons the Canadian-American actor took on the role of Ji-Yoon Kim in the Netflix comedy drama series, “The Chair.” Oh plays the new head of a struggling college’s English department. As rewarding as she finds “Killing Eve,” Oh says its darker elements made her want to live in a “comedy space” for a change. The six-episode “The Chair” blends humor with the serious challenges that Ji-Yoon faces at home and at the school facing financial woes and generational clashes. The series debuts today on Netflix. --- ICYMI ... OTTAWA — Defence Department spokeswoman Jessica Lamirande says the C-17 military transport planes flying into Afghanistan have been reconfigured to maximize the number of passengers they can carry. She says the planes are already flying in and out of Kabul and that troops will be given a list of vetted and vulnerable Afghans and will be helping them board the flights. Lamirande says the flights will carry foreign and Afghan nationals who have been accepted under the immigration programs of other nations. And she adds that other nations have, and will continue to, extract Canadian citizens or Afghans who are destined for or eligible for immigration to Canada. The effort to get former Afghan interpreters and their families out of Afghanistan is gathering momentum in the face of complaints about roadblocks in Kabul and bureaucratic hurdles in Ottawa. Yesterday, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau revealed the Canadian military had arrived back in Afghanistan to help with evacuation efforts. At the same time, he admitted Canada would probably not be able to get everyone out of Afghanistan that it wants to. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 20, 2021 Subject: COVID-19 vaccines; Pandemics; Forest & brush fires; Coronaviruses; Immigration"

"2021-08-22","Full text: Experts praise Montreal's single-use plastic plan MONTREAL - Environmental experts are praising Montreal's decision to ban some kinds of single-use plastics, but they say Canada is still a long way from being plastic-free despite government promises. Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante announced on Wednesday that the city would ban retailers and restaurants from distributing plastic bags in the city by end of August 2022. Six months later, a number of other single-use items will be banned, she said, including takeout food containers, cups, lids, utensils and stir sticks made from unrecyclable or hard-to-recycle plastics. Plante described her city's plan as the most ambitious in North America, and she said what sets it apart is the focus on reducing plastic at the source. ""For some cities, recycling is priority No. 1,"" she said. ""For us, it’s reducing, reducing, reducing."" The mayor added that the urgency was heightened by the fact the city's only landfill is expected to be full by 2029. Ashley Wallis, a plastics pollution expert with environmental charity Oceana Canada, described Montreal's initiative as a ""great step,"" and she had particular praise for the decision to include drink cups on the list of banned items — something other governments, including Ottawa, have stopped short of doing. ""We do know that 47 per cent of Canada's plastic waste is from single-use plastics and plastics packaging, so I think there is a huge opportunity by focusing on things like these single-use takeaway items,"" she said in a phone interview Wednesday. However, Wallis said that despite cities' best efforts, Canada is still far away from a plastic-free future. In 2019, the federal government announced it intended to ban several single-use plastic items, including plastic bags, straws, stir sticks, six-pack rings, cutlery and hard-to-recycle takeout containers — a list Wallis described as ""too narrowly scoped."" Ottawa has also promised to impose recycled-content requirements. As well, the federal government has discussed making some companies responsible for collecting their products made of plastic when they aren't useful anymore, as part of a goal to achieve zero plastic waste by 2030. But those regulations, which were promised by end of 2021, have yet to be unveiled and could be derailed by the upcoming federal election, Wallis said. Federal legislation on plastic ought to include takeout cups, she said, as well as all forms of polystyrene and oxo-degradable plastics, which break down quickly. Longer term, she said, what's needed is a comprehensive, sector-by-sector plan to reduce and reuse plastic, with manufacturers being given the main responsibility for collection and recycling. Even Montreal's plan contains some omissions. It doesn't include cardboard takeout containers with plastic coating and excludes non-profits that distribute food, for example. More importantly, it can't affect anything outside the city's jurisdiction, which includes grocery store items because they're packaged outside city limits. Plante said she was hoping the city's action would ""influence in a very positive and proactive way the other levels of government."" Karen Wirsig, the plastics program manager for advocacy group Environmental Defence, says more federal and provincial action is needed to push back against a plastics industry that is reluctant to change. The most effective way to do that, she said, is to ""make the people who produce those things responsible for them at end of life,"" and make sure they can't just bury or burn them. While that's largely a provincial and federal effort, she said cities, too, have a role to play in plastic reduction. In addition to banning plastic items, as Montreal has done, she said cities can create more local infrastructure to help businesses and restaurants offer reusable containers. ""Nationwide standards are important. But for things like infrastructure, those really need to be local,"" she said in a phone interview Wednesday. Wirsig acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic has represented a setback for plastic reduction efforts, but she said it was also an opportunity for creative thinking. On one hand, takeout and online ordering have skyrocketed, creating more waste. Originally, the pandemic led to fears — now largely debunked, she said — that the disease could be spread on containers. On the other hand, she said the pandemic has also led many people to question their relationship to their local environments and they may be ready for positive change. ""There's no question that the pandemic put us back, but I think it's also been a moment where people are rethinking their relationship with their surroundings, their relationship with their local environment, and it may be a great moment to change some of those old ways we had,"" she said.

"2021-08-22","Full text: The size of Powassan town council will remain at five members and not increase to seven as Coun. Randy Hall wanted. Several reasons were cited for maintaining the status quo, including identifying enough qualified candidates to seek public office in future elections and continuing to save money. However, Hall believes the municipality is going to experience rapid growth in the next few years and said that warrants a larger council. He cites the 50-unit seniors complex currently being built in Powassan and the 96-bed nursing home announced for Trout Creek as two examples that will automatically increase the population of the municipality, as well as the jobs the nursing home will bring. Hall also said an area of Powassan has been identified for more residential growth, although he didn’t get into specifics. Hall hopes all this growth will also attract more businesses. Hall isn't worried about the volume of work the next two years will bring for council members but believes that work will increase in the next three to five years. He says with council facing additional work, the next municipal election should be run with seven elected positions, which is what the municipality had before it amalgamated with Trout Creek. Councillors Dave Britton and Debbie Piekarski were members of council when it had seven members and Piekarski said while there is nothing wrong with more opinions being heard at the council table, under the previous format, there were instances when it was difficult to attract council candidates. “I don't know if many people are interested in doing what we do,” she said. Piekarski said she could go either way, which is also how Britton felt but he added “in terms of cohesion, five works better.” Coun. Marcus Wand repeated Piekarski's concern about attracting people to run for council if the municipality increased the number of elected officials by two. Wand also raised the issue of the added expenses as a reason to maintain the status quo. He said in the past, there were discussions to raise the council remuneration, which translates into higher expenses. Wand said even if the council salary remained the same, costs would still go up if two more members were added. “I don't think it would fly with the community,” he said. “To me there's more of a negative impact of going to a seven-member council as opposed to staying at five.” Mayor Peter McIsaac told his colleagues he favoured staying at five members. McIsaac said there were times under the seven-member scenario that council had difficulties getting a quorum but that hasn't happened since moving to a five-member elected body. McIsaac said the municipality reduced the number of councillors as a cost-saving device. In the past, council had two councillors sit on committees, but when the size of council was reduced to five, the committee representation was cut to one. “And the same amount of work is getting done,” he said. “I don't see how (municipal) growth means more work for council,” McIsaac said. “It means more work for staff but the council meetings will be the same.” Rocco Frangione is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the North Bay Nugget.

"2021-08-22","Full text: Member out of Ontario Tory caucus over vax refusal TORONTO - An Ontario legislator who refused to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was removed from the governing Progressive Conservative caucus on Thursday. Premier Doug Ford defended the party's decision to oust Rick Nicholls, saying elected officials must ""lead by example"" on vaccination. Ford said Nicholls, who represents Chatham-Kent-Leamington, also won't be permitted to seek re-election as a Tory candidate after he ""failed to provide a legitimate reason"" for not getting vaccinated. ""It is my expectation that every PC caucus member and candidate not only support the role vaccines play in the fight against COVID-19, but also be vaccinated to protect themselves and the people in their community,"" Ford said in a statement. He wrote that elected officials ""must rightfully be held to a higher standard,"" adding their work puts them in regular interaction with the public and those vulnerable to the virus. Nicholls and Scarborough Center representative Christina Mitas were both given a deadline of 5 p.m. on Thursday to show proof of vaccination or a medical exemption. Ford said Mitas provided a medical exemption statement from a physician and will stay in caucus, taking ""additional precautions"" while carrying out her duties. His office did not provide details on what medical exemptions to vaccination were considered acceptable for caucus members. Nicholls told a news conference earlier on Thursday that he made the ""personal choice"" not to get vaccinated and wouldn't be immunized against the virus. ""Under no circumstances will I, nor should any Ontarian, be forced or coerced to do something against their will,"" he said. Nicholls left the news conference after taking one question from the media and did not elaborate on his personal reason for not taking the vaccine. Ford, who is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and has urged all Ontario residents to get immunized, has previously said he wouldn't make the vaccine mandatory, because he considers it a constitutional right not to take the shots. Nicholls said he ""took the premier at his word that vaccination is a choice and that all Ontarians have a constitutional right to make such a choice."" He said he raised his concerns about the policy with Ford. The directive applying to Tory caucus members was stricter than measures announced by Ford's government this week affecting workers in education, health care other high-risk settings. Those policies would see unvaccinated workers subject to regular COVID-19 tests before coming to work. The province also announced on Thursday that Ontario Public Service employees would need to be regularly tested if not vaccinated against the virus.

The party says in a statement this morning that the correspondence was sent to a ""limited group of supporters"" by a vendor. The Tories say they didn't intend to mislead people and that they regret the correspondence. It's the first time the party has acknowledged that it was responsible for the letters, images of which began circulating on social media earlier this week. Opposition parties have called for investigations, including a police probe, into the letters, which the Liberals argue could constitute a scam. The Liberals have also called for the Progressive Conservative party to return any funds it received from people through the mailouts.

To cut down on followups that take valuable time away from actual emergencies, the force says it will start sending automated text messages to those making disconnected 9-1-1 calls.

"2021-09-22","Full text: B.C.’s Office of the Human Rights Commissioner will examine the rise of hate during the pandemic as the topic of its first public inquiry, says Commissioner Kasari Govender. “Our intent is to examine hate in all its forms,” Govender said at an online press conference this morning. “Not only racism and racial hate, but hate directed at a wide range of people and groups in our society who are protected under B.C.’s Human Rights Code and under international human rights law. For example, hate that is perpetuated against a person or a group on the basis of their religion, their gender identity, their Indigeneity, their sexual orientation or whether they live in poverty or without a home.” Govender started her five-year term as B.C.’s first independent Human Rights Commissioner in September 2019. The Office of the Human Rights Commissioner has a mandate to “address the root causes of inequality, discrimination and injustice in B.C. by shifting laws, policies, practices and cultures … through education, research, advocacy, inquiry and monitoring.” For its first inquiry, the office is focusing on hate “because of a significant increase in hate-related incidents, including online incidents, in B.C. since the start of the pandemic in early 2020,” says Govender. “Many of us are uncomfortable acknowledging hate because we want to think of our country as a peaceful, respectful place, but the truth is that hate is here and from all accounts, it is growing.” She refers specifically to the rise of hate crimes against Asian and Indigenous Peoples. “Since the onset of the pandemic, there have been more than 1,500 incidents of anti-Asian racism reported to elimin8hate.org and covidracism.ca, and B.C. continues to report the most incidents per capita in North America,” she says. “In 2020, police-reported hate crimes in Canada targeting Indigenous Peoples increased 152 per cent compared to 2019.” As wildfires rage throughout the province and the world struggles to contain the pandemic and navigate humanitarian crises, Govender says tackling hate should be a top priority. “Hate often stems from a fear of losing power, a fear that is aggravated during times of great uncertainty. “While COVID-19 has inflamed the problems of hate and white supremacy in B.C., it did not create them … It is precisely when our societies, homes and families are most under threat that human rights are most precarious and require the most support.” Through this inquiry, the commissioner will look into the “kinds of hate individuals and communities in B.C. experienced during the pandemic,” and the impacts of those incidents. Govender says she wants to know how we can “address, eliminate or prevent hate incidents during times of crisis and beyond.” She’s asking: “How effectively have public and private institutions responded to hate during the pandemic, and how effective is our public policy and law in addressing hate?”"

"2021-09-21","Full text: General who led vaccine campaign charged OTTAWA - The military officer who led Canada's COVID-19 vaccine distribution campaign has been charged with one count of sexual assault. Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin presented himself to police in Gatineau, Que., Wednesday after a warrant for his arrest was issued Monday. He later told reporters that he does not know the details of the allegation against him, despite repeated requests from his legal team. ""For the past three months, my family and I have been living this nightmare of not knowing the nature of the allegation, not knowing the status of the investigation, not knowing whether or not I'd be charged,"" Fortin said. ""My legal team has repeatedly — repeatedly — contacted prosecutors to seek any information with no success. So I've been forced to read much about me in media, with no ability to defend my name."" Fortin's lawyers have said the only information provided to them is that the charge relates to an alleged incident from 1988. The senior military officer, who has previously served in Afghanistan and Iraq, described the past three months as the most challenging period of his 36 years in uniform. ""This fight against an invisible foe has been the hardest of my career,"" he said. ""I look forward to continuing to serve Canadians, to serve my country, as soon as this legal issue is resolved."" Fortin was abruptly removed from his post at the Public Health Agency of Canada on May 14 after leading the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across the country. The Canadian Forces National Investigation Service later referred an allegation of sexual misconduct against him to the Quebec prosecution service to determine whether charges should be laid. Fortin has asked the Federal Court to review his removal, alleging in a sworn affidavit political interference by the Liberal government. He is asking for reinstatement to his position at PHAC, or a similar post. Defence Department spokeswoman Jessica Lamirande said Wednesday that Fortin was given to a temporary position on Aug. 12. ""Maj.-Gen. Fortin was assigned temporarily to a supernumerary position as senior adviser to commander of Canadian Joint Operations Command in Ottawa,"" Lamirande said in an email. ""A determination on next steps will be made in due course. We will not provide further details at this time due to privacy considerations and that the matter is currently before the courts."" Fortin said he is paying his own legal costs for the criminal and Federal Court actions. His next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 20, the same day that voters go to the polls. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau declined to comment on Fortin’s case during a campaign stop in Vancouver on Wednesday. “But I will repeat how incredibly important it is that everyone who serves in the Canadian Armed Forces has an environment that is safe and supportive,” the prime minister said. “We need to make sure that anyone who comes forward with allegations or with concerns is receiving the proper support, the proper resources. But at the same time that we work to transform the culture of our Canadian Armed Forces.” One of Fortin's lawyers has raised questions about the timing of the decision to charge her client, which comes days after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau launched an election. The Liberals have been criticized for months for not doing more to address sexual misconduct in the Canadian military. Fortin’s lawyers have argued in Federal Court that the decision to remove their client was unreasonable, lacked procedural fairness and involved improper political interference in the military chain of command by Trudeau, Health Minister Patty Hajdu, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and clerk of the Privy Council. The government is required to respond to those allegations on Sept. 17, three days before election day. “The timing of the charge raises questions,” Fortin's lawyer, Natalia Rodriguez, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday. “We’ll be looking at answering those questions and making sure this is not politically motivated and that it is above board. As Maj.-Gen. Fortin’s lawyers, we have a duty to ensure that there’s been no improper political interference in this case.” In response, Sajjan's spokesman Daniel Minden on Wednesday said: ""In Canada, decisions to lay criminal charges are made by independent prosecutors. We have no further comment as this matter is before the courts.”"

"2021-09-21","Full text: $4.15B tunnel to replace Metro Vancouver relic RICHMOND, B.C. - An eight-lane tunnel under the Fraser River will replace an obsolete crossing that has frustrated Metro Vancouver drivers for decades. The B.C. government announced the new tunnel connecting the cities of Delta and Richmond on Highway 99 will cost $4.15 billion, with an estimated completion date of 2030. Construction of the replacement for the George Massey Tunnel is set to start in 2025,Transportation Minister Rob Fleming told a news conference Wednesday. The new tunnel will improve traffic flow, save travel time and make travel easier for those taking transit, cycling or walking, he said, adding it will not be tolled. Two of the eight lanes, one in each direction, will be dedicated to rapid bus transit and there will be separated pathways for cyclists and pedestrians. ""We're developing a tunnel that will not only significantly improve travel along (the) Highway 99 corridor but will also give people real options to leave their cars at home in favour of efficient public transit or active transportation,"" Fleming said. Asked whether the planned tunnel will really reduce travel time for commuters during rush hour given two lanes will be reserved for buses, Fleming said the current four-lane tunnel uses a counter-flow system that leads to congestion. ""When it's in a counter-flow peak period, it goes down to one lane in one direction, so you get congestion throughout the (tunnel)"" wherever you're heading, he said. The tunnel option was chosen instead of an eight-lane bridge because it was endorsed by the regional district, causes the least harm to the surrounding area, including the river, and allows for work to start right away, the province said. Former premier Christy Clark promised a 10-lane bridge during the 2013 election, but the work was put on hold when the NDP took power in 2017. The bridge project had a completion date set for 2022 and in defence of the delay, Fleming pointed to ""strenuous objections"" to that plan from local governments. The BC Liberals responded to the announcement of the new tunnel, saying commuters are being forced to wait in gridlock for another 10 years. ""Construction on the new tunnel will not begin for five years, leaving people trying to get to work, a doctor's appointment or their kid's practice to pay the price,"" Liberal transportation critic Michael Lee said in a statement. The estimated cost of the project is $1.55 billion higher than the bridge proposed by the former Liberal government, the statement said. An environmental assessment certificate had been issued for the previously planned bridge and Fleming said the province will move ahead immediately with improvements to the surrounding infrastructure while it works through the procurement and environmental assessment processes for the new tunnel. ""We're going to have a robust environmental assessment on this project, we're going to continue to work with Indigenous rights holders,"" he said. The province is hoping to receive ""significant federal contribution"" to help cover the cost of the project, Fleming said. ""The discussions we've had with the federal government have been very productive in this regard,"" he said, adding that to his knowledge, the major parties campaigning in the federal election set for Sept. 20 are also supportive of the project. ""We've made the case that this is a nationally significant trade corridor."" Asked how long the new crossing is expected to keep up with population growth and development in the region, Fleming said congestion modelling and growth projections will be part of a business case that should soon be publicly available. — by Brenna Owen in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 18, 2021.

"2021-08-21","Full text: Health minister announces Tory leadership bid WINNIPEG - The race to become the next leader of Manitoba's Progressive Conservatives is revving up with the province's former health minister the first to throw her hat in the ring. Heather Stefanson, 51, said she has submitted her resignation from her cabinet position and intends to run for the leadership. ""We will work with Manitobans to move forward — to strengthen our health-care system, create jobs, improve education and advance reconciliation and economic opportunity for Indigenous people,"" Stefanson said Wednesday. Audrey Gordon has been appointed the new minister of health, on top of her portfolio as minister of mental health, wellness and recovery. Premier Brian Pallister announced last week he would not be leading the Tories in the next election, which is scheduled for 2023. He has not said how long he will stay on as premier or as a member of the legislature, and dates for a leadership contest have not been announced. Stefanson announced her intentions with the support of 24 of the 36 Progressive Conservative legislative members. ""This kind of support is impressive,"" said Royce Koop, who teaches political studies at the University of Manitoba. Her one significant liability is that she was a minister in Pallister's government, Koop added, so she will need to create some distance between herself and the premier. In her bid for the Tories top spot, Stefanson committed to abandoning controversial education legislation that was significant to Pallister's legacy. ""Bill 64 is done,"" Stefanson said about the plan to reform the education system. ""Instead, a Progressive Conservative government under my leadership will listen to parents and make sure we have an education system that prepares our children to succeed in everything they do."" Experts have said there are no present front-runners but Stefanson, as well as Families Minister Rochelle Squires and Conservative member of Parliament Candice Bergen, have been touted as possible candidates. Finance Minister Scott Fielding has also said he is seriously considering a run for the job. Stefanson has been the legislature member for the south Winnipeg riding of Tuxedo since 2000. Previously, she served as the minister of justice and families. She was also deputy premier before she took over the health file earlier this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Opposition New Democrats called for any new Tory leader to require all members of caucus to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It follows a directive from Ontario's Progressive Conservative government this week that all of its members be vaccinated or face ejection from caucus. ""Manitobans expect their elected officials to lead by example,"" said NDP house leader Nahanni Fontaine. The PC party's executive council has said it will be meeting to determine leadership contest rules. Its constitution states the next leader is to be chosen by all party members on a one-member, one-vote basis. Pallister ran unopposed for leader in 2012 and guided the Tories to the largest majority government in a century four years later. He had been hinting about retirement for more than a year. His popularity dropped sharply as Manitoba dealt with the pandemic and pressure for his exit increased after he came under fire for comments he made about Canadian history. Pallister later apologized for saying that people who came to Canada before and after it became a country did not come to destroy but to build.

"2021-08-21","Full text: Election focus shifts to high inflation OTTAWA - Justin Trudeau's political opponents took aim at him on the campaign trail Wednesday over the cost of living, facing broadsides from Conservatives for the decade-high pace of price growth and the NDP for high housing prices. The country's headline inflation barometer clocked in at 3.7 per cent in July, which Statistics Canada said was the highest year-over-year increase since May 2011 as price growth accelerated from June. Speaking to reporters in Quebec City, O'Toole said the Liberal government's approach to the economy fuelled the increase, but also pinned blame on NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh as well, saying the Liberals and New Democrats ""are the reason why there's inflation."" O'Toole said the inflation numbers should worry Canadians, many of whom have come to him complaining about the price of groceries and homes, adding that families on the margins are being priced out of their way of life. Pressed for details on how a Conservative government would respond, O'Toole spoke about his party's promise to waive the GST on purchases made this December. ""It's not restructuring our entire financial system. It's recognizing we need to let families get ahead and at the same time support brick-and-mortar retail stores that are falling behind,"" O'Toole said at an event outlining his party's plans to increase accountability in government. ""We are thinking outside the box to give people a little bit more of their own money. That's never going to happen with Justin Trudeau or Mr. Singh. They want to increase taxes. They are the reason why there is inflation."" Conservatives have blamed the Liberal government for ""out-of-control"" inflation and accused the Bank of Canada of being in cahoots to enable the Liberals to finance their massive pandemic relief spending. Speaking in Vancouver, where he promised extra aid to fight wildfires and help for homeowners to fund climate-change retrofits, Trudeau said he respected the independence of the central bank to set its own policies to manage inflation He then turned his attention to O'Toole, charging that the Conservative leader couldn't be considered serious on cost-of-living questions with his child care tax credit that he argued wouldn't help women get into the workforce, and the economy overall, like the Liberal child-care system. ""The fact that Erin O'Toole doesn't get that is yet another example of the fact that the Conservatives are stuck in a Harper version of solutions to problems that simply don't work,"" Trudeau said. Statistics Canada said on Wednesday that part of the elevated inflation reading for July is because prices are being compared to the lows seen one year ago during the early months of the pandemic, particularly gasoline and food. BMO Economics noted Wednesday that prices increased by 1.9 per cent in July compared with the same month in 2019, prior to the pandemic. Another factor is current conditions: More parts of the economy opened in July as public health restrictions eased, and businesses have increased prices in the face of increased demand — aided along by federal pandemic supports — and to manage higher costs."

"2021-08-20","Full text: N.S. premier-designate says pandemic top priority NEW GLASGOW, N.S. - During his first news conference as premier-designate a day after his party's election win, Nova Scotia Tory Leader Tim Houston said Wednesday his first order of business is keeping citizens safe from COVID-19. The Progressive Conservatives surged to victory over the governing Liberals, winning a majority with 31 ridings in the province's newly expanded 55-seat legislature. Houston told reporters gathered in New Glasgow, N.S., that he will invite other parties to participate in meetings with public health officials, as he considers policies aimed at avoiding a fourth wave of the novel coronavirus. ""This is not something I think should be politicized,"" he said. ""I think it should be everyone pointed in the same direction and that direction is keeping Nova Scotians safe."" The 51-year-old leader said he intends to meet chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang later in the day to talk about issues such as how to reduce transmission when students return to school. ""There are Nova Scotians all across the province that are really, really anxious to go back to school. We want to make sure that they understand the plan."" Other key concerns, he said, include increasing the number of Nova Scotia residents vaccinated against COVID-19 and monitoring the fourth wave of the novel coronavirus in other parts of the country. ""We're going to listen to Public Health, we're going to work with Dr. Strang and his team, we're going to get all of the information to make some common sense decisions,"" he said. ""The public safety of Nova Scotians is my primary concern."" And as the newly minted premier-designate spoke to reporters, about 100 protesters gathered 150 kilometres away in Halifax, trying to prevent the removal of temporary shelters for the homeless. The City of Halifax started to remove the small, wooden shelters last month, and police suddenly arrived on bicycles early Wednesday to provide security as heavy machinery moved in. NDP Leader Gary Burrill arrived at the scene, located in a riding his party won in Tuesday’s election, and led a chant of “Homes not cops, homes not cops.” “Nobody has expressed a desire for this police action,"" Burrill said. ""We know we have a desperate housing crisis in Nova Scotia and if the government’s response is to send in a heavily armed police presence to evict people from tents and shelter where they’ve sought shelter, it’s a pretty darn poor response. “As soon as the premier-designate has heard this disgrace is taking place, he should immediately be here himself to see it doesn’t proceed.” Houston said he understands Nova Scotians are feeling the strain of housing shortages but he will not change his plan to lift rent control measures when the pandemic ends. ""Housing is in crisis,"" he said. ""We know the housing crisis is very real. It didn't develop overnight. It's been developing over eight years. We didn't have tent cities eight years ago. ""I understand the significance of the issue and we're going to work with people to make sure they can access housing."" Lisa Lachance, the newly elected NDP member of the legislature for Halifax-Citadel-Sable Island, said the problem of homelessness has been growing in her riding for the past decade. “Things have changed in this community and there are people one rent increase away from also needing shelter … there’s been no investment in housing, no rent control when it was needed, no support organizations to respond appropriately is what we’re seeing,” she said. Meanwhile, there were signs of a steady flow of new infections of COVID-19, with nine new cases being reported in the province, bringing the total active cases of COVID-19 to 25. Houston repeated his campaign promise that his party will improve the health system, including by increasing the number of doctors and shortening surgery wait times. The premier-designate said he'll begin implementing his health-care-focused platform by consulting with workers in the network.

The District of Logan Lake ordered the evacuation of the Highland Valley site on August 15th but that order has now been lifted. The nearly 640-square kilometre Tremont Creek wildfire threatened Logan Lake and Cherry Creek earlier this week but rain and cool conditions have calmed it and the wildfire service says mop-up is now underway in the Logan Lake area.

Conservation officers weren't immediately informed so couldn't track the animal but they are urging the public to stay out of the park because of the likelihood of being confronted by an aggressive coyote. Nearly three dozen interactions between humans and coyotes have been reported in the park since last December and four of the animals have been tracked and killed this summer after several incidents -- including two where young children were bitten.

The Canadian Press has obtained a letter issued by Government whip Lorne Coe saying every member of the Ontario government must get vaccinated unless they are medically unable to do so. The directive comes as Premier Doug Ford has refused to mandate vaccinations for front-line health and education workers despite mounting calls to do so. A senior government source tells The Canadian Press that the letter was sent to two Tory legislators who are not yet vaccinated against the virus -- but they were not identified.

Unions representing elementary, high school, Catholic and French teachers say the provincial policy requiring unvaccinated staff to get regular COVID-19 tests is not strict enough. The unions say a mandatory vaccination policy would provide greater protection against the spread of COVID-19 in schools and protect students -- especially those under 12 who aren't eligible for shots. They also note that details of the provincial plan are still being finalized with the new academic year starting in less than three weeks.

But other boards are reporting much lower numbers, including Limestone District School Board based out of Kingston, where only two per cent of students will learn remotely when school resumes.

"2021-08-20","Full text: As Ariana Yaftali watches the images coming out of Afghanistan of the Taliban quickly taking over the country and Afghans desperately trying to flee, she can’t help but feel heartbroken for her home country, and she knows the work she does to help Afghan women settle in Canada will be that much more important moving forward. “As a community we are shocked, we are devastated, and we are heartbroken,” Yaftali said. Yaftali, who is from Afghanistan, and who came to Winnipeg in 2001, is one of the founders of the Afghan-Canadian Women's Organizations, a not-for-profit that supports Afghan women and their families to settle in Canada. She said that for many years she and others with the organization have worked closely with Afghan women to make them comfortable in their new homes after leaving Afghanistan. “We offer settlement support as well as navigation, and we provide education about Canadian laws and the Canadian political and social system,” Yaftali said. “We are here to help build women’s capacity to become productive members of Canadian society.” And as the Taliban have quickly taken control of Afghanistan over the last few days, Yaftali is now worried about what that takeover will mean for the women and girls living in the country who will now likely live under Taliban rule. “They don’t believe in education for young girls and women, and they do not allow for women to participate in political, social, and economic areas in Afghanistan, so it is a very, very scary time for these women and girls,” she said. “I can’t help but feel heartbroken, and I can’t imagine the fear that so many women and girls are now feeling.” What has shocked Yaftali the most about the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan is the speed in which it all happened. “We were not surprised that they took over when the U.S. government and international community withdrew, we knew definitely these people would be back and it was just a matter of time, but we are completely shocked by how fast they took control.” Yaftali added she is very disappointed with the U.S. government and with the international community for what she said has been the “abandoning” of the Afghan people. “Now we feel very abandoned and we feel betrayed, because they just allowed the country back into the hands of the terrorists,” she said. “I don’t think a lot about politicians and leaders, but I care deeply about those poor people, and those women and children who are suffering.” In her role with the Afghan-Canadian Women's Organization, Yaftali said she is now focused on helping as many Afghan refugees as possible come to Canada, but she said she wants more answers and more information from the federal government about their recent announcement that they plan to resettle 20,000 vulnerable Afghans who are now threatened by the Taliban, and forced to flee Afghanistan. “It’s confusing and now on top of it we have the election called, but we really need to know the details of this 20,000 plan, and how we can help and work with the government,” Yaftali said. “We are ready to help these people, and we are ready to work with and collaborate with this government.” And as the situation continues to devolve in Afghanistan, Yaftali said she now worries she and others will only continue to see disturbing images coming out of the country in the coming days, months, and years. “Right now it is chaos, just pure chaos, with people even trying to grab onto the sides of airplanes you can see how desperate the situation really is, and how desperately people are trying to get out,” Yaftali said. “And it’s been like this for many years, it’s just a place now where all you see is destruction and misery.

The Examiner spoke with members of the all-Black Apex Invitational Golf Association Committee about last year's cancellation, the Apex youth scholarships that were still awarded last year despite the cancellation, the community aspect of the weekend, and how the annual event came to be. Here's what Shelley Borden, an Apex committee member and Apex women's division participant, said: This past August 1 was the first federally recognized Emancipation Day in Canada, commemorating the same day in 1834 when slavery was officially abolished in the British colonies, including what would eventually become Canada. Celebrations continued throughout the month of August, including this past weekend in downtown Halifax. The United African Canadian Women Association and the Office of African Nova Scotia Affairs held a parade on Saturday that started at the Halifax waterfront and ended up at Parade Square where there were a number of speeches. From there, participants and guests moved to The Commons for a picnic. Funmi Joseph, one of the co-founders of the United African Canadian Women's Association plans for the parade to become an annual event. Speaking with Alex Guye at CBC Joseph said: Global News reported that on August 7 a shooting had taken place in North Preston just after 2pm. As could be expected, hateful comments that got likes and laugh reactions were left in the social media comments: Sadly, days later it was reported that a second shooting was reported the following day in North Preston, followed by a third shooting the day after that in north-end Dartmouth near Jellybean Square to which one commenter replied: Last month, Halifax Regional Police Superintendent Dean Simmonds and his wife, Liberal MLA candidate Angela Simmonds accused Cole Harbour RCMP of racism when they were pulled over at gunpoint following a reported shooting in North Preston on July 4. There was a protest in downtown Halifax this past Saturday in opposition to vaccine passports. This follows Liberal leader Iain Rankin saying that, if re-elected, he would implement a mandatory vaccine passport system, dubbed ScotiaPass. A similar, albeit much larger, protest took place in Montreal as well on Saturday. Quebec has already said it will implement vaccine passports on September 1. The same day as Rankin's announcement, research was published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) and talked about how existing inequities among ""ethnoculrual communities"" in Canada were worsened by the pandemic.

"2021-09-22","Full text: All Canadian diplomats out of Afghanistan: Trudeau OTTAWA - A 10th planeload of Afghan refugees arrived Tuesday evening in Canada as Justin Trudeau's Liberal government faced fresh criticism and calls for action to save hundreds of former interpreters and their families still stuck in Afghanistan. A government official said 92 people were on board, including Afghan refugees and their families and Canadian citizens. They left Afghanistan a few days ago and arrived via a third country, said Alexander Cohen, spokesman for Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino. Liberals arranged for reporters travelling with Trudeau's campaign to view the passengers being processed in tents on the tarmac after getting off an Air Transat plane at Toronto's Pearson airport. Some were carrying small bags, others had small children in their arms. After processing, the passengers boarded two coach buses. As one of the two buses departed, some children on board could be seen waving. Until now, the government has been very secretive about the arrival of refugees in a bid to protect them and the security of the evacuation operation. That reporters were allowed to view their arrival Tuesday — under strict orders not to reveal identities or photograph faces — likely reflects the heat Trudeau is feeling for calling an election in the midst of the escalating crisis in Afghanistan. Earlier Tuesday, Trudeau revealed on the campaign trail that all Canadian diplomats have left Afghanistan. Speaking at a campaign event in Markham, Ont., the Liberal leader and prime minister said nine flights out of Afghanistan had arrived in Canada over the past few weeks. That included two chartered civilian flights that arrived in Toronto and Ottawa late Monday night. The Department of National Defence confirmed that the Toronto-bound aircraft that landed Monday was carrying Afghans admitted through a special immigration program for former interpreters and others, while the Ottawa-bound plane carried Canadian diplomats and special forces troops. “Over the last weeks, we have had nine flights out of Afghanistan, including having fully evacuated all of our diplomatic officials,” Trudeau said. “We're also working closely with the U.S. and looking at how we can remove more people in the coming days and weeks. And we're working with our allies on what Canada as part of the international community can do to stabilize the situation, protect civilians, and put an end to the violence.” The Conservatives said Tuesday that key cabinet ministers involved in the evacuation should suspend their re-election efforts to focus on the issue. ""These Afghans risked their lives to assist Canadian soldiers and diplomats — and now is their time of need,"" said a statement from Conservative incumbent candidates Alex Ruff and Michael Chong. They aimed their request at Mendicino, Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan. Trudeau did not say how many Afghans were on the flight to Toronto that landed Monday, when they left Afghanistan or who they are. He has said that more than 800 former interpreters, cultural advisers, drivers, cleaners and others, as well as their families, have arrived through a special immigration program established in July. That program followed months of pressure from Canadian veterans and others worried about former Afghan colleagues, with many of those veterans now criticizing the government for not having acted faster to save Afghans who are now at risk because they supported Canada. Andrew Rusk, the founder of a national advocacy campaign to bring interpreters and local staff to Canada, has said his group is aware of at least 2,000 individuals still in Afghanistan waiting to be evacuated. The evacuation of all Canadian diplomats from Afghanistan follows the Taliban’s stunning seizure of Kabul on Sunday, which followed a lightning-quick takeover of the country that caught Afghans and the world by surprise. The Taliban’s march into the capital prompted widespread panic and a rush for the country’s main airport, with some people clinging to the side of a U.S. military plane before takeoff in a video that captured the sense of desperation as the 20-year war came to a chaotic end. The Conservatives also demanded Tuesday that the Liberals deploy the military to Kabul to help spirit out those who worked with Canada. “The government must act now,” Conservative James Bezan said during a news conference. “Prime Minister Trudeau must give direction to the military to land those planes and rescue all our people before it's too late.” Trudeau, whose government also promised last week to resettle an additional 20,000 Afghan refugees who have already left the country, said Canada would continue to try to help the interpreters. That includes applying “every flexibility” when it comes to providing the necessary paperwork to immigration officials, he said, in reference to what veterans and others have blasted as the government’s unrealistic — and potentially dangerous — documentary requirements. “Obviously, the situation right now is extremely fluid,” Trudeau added. “The Taliban has taken control of approaches to the airport, which is making it extremely difficult for people to get to the airport in order to get out. And that is something that we continue to work on.” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby revealed Tuesday that the U.S. military is co-ordinating with the Taliban, who declared an ""amnesty,"" while accelerating the airlift of Americans and Afghan allies from the Kabul airport, and also bringing in additional U.S. troops in a scramble to complete the evacuation by Aug. 31. The disclosure that U.S. commanders are speaking with Taliban commanders is an indication that the new rulers of Afghanistan, who swept to power after 20 years of war against the U.S.-supported Kabul government, will not interfere with the evacuation. Kirby also said plans were being made to house up to 22,000 evacuated Afghans and their families at three military installations in the U.S. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance was working to facilitate the evacuation of Afghans as quickly as possible, even as he demanded the Taliban keep the airport, roads and border crossings open. Stoltenberg also appeared to lay down some markers for recognizing a Taliban government, saying: ""There must be a peaceful transfer of power to an inclusive government. With no revenge or retribution. A government that does not respect the fundamental rights of all Afghans and reinstates the reign of fear, risks international isolation."""

"2021-09-22","Full text: Drought-stricken agricultural producers struggling with relentless heat and dryness may see more relief on the way as Ottawa bumps AgriRecovery funding to $500 million. ""Our Government is doing everything it can to support farm families so they can get through these challenges today, and be better positioned for a sustainable future,"" said federal Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau. ""Today's commitment of up to half a billion dollars shows we stand ready to contribute our share toward AgriRecovery programs with the provinces. We are united in our goal of ensuring that farmers are fully supported through this crisis."" Earlier this month, Ottawa announced $100 million for the program, which will be included in this new total. AgriRecovery falls under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership and offers a 60-40 split with provinces that have signed on. The federal government is working with Saskatchewan and other affected provinces to complete joint assessments of the disaster and launch support programs. Direct assistance will go to affected livestock and other producers and will help them with the added costs of obtaining livestock feed, transportation and water. On Aug. 10, provincial Agriculture Minister David Marit announced $119 million for AgriRecovery. Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan (APAS) vice president Bill Prybylski said the money may offer some welcome relief to farmers suffering from drought — especially those in the livestock industry stressed by a lack of water and feed. The money can help operations retain breeding stock and keep the livestock industry viable, he said. Saskatchewan Cattlemen's Association (SCA) President Ryder Lee said he was pleased to see the funding announcement before the election writ dropped. Every operation has its own unique needs, but the money can mitigate some of the drought's impact on producers struggling with challenges like water or hay, he said. As farmers wait for those benefits, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture has also kicked off its Hay West initiative to send surplus hay from eastern farmers to their counterparts facing drought in Western Canada. Hay West was first organized in 2002 to assist Prairie farmers as they struggled through a similar drought. The arrangement reversed 10 years later, when Western farmers shipped hay east as those producers faced drought, a news release said. In a prepared statement, CFA President Mary Robinson said this year's program is in its early stages. CFA staff and a third party are working with railways and government to facilitate drought assistance. Lee of the SCA said he's appreciative of the effort, but unsure how much hay will make its way to Saskatchewan, given the scale of demand for it across Western Canada. While some wait for the hay, the demonstration of support may carry a ""psychological boost,"" Prybylski said. ""It's good to know that farmers (have) each other's backs."" — With files from Josh Aldrich, Postmedia News Subject: Livestock industry; Agriculture; Livestock"

"2021-09-22","Full text: What started off as talk for staging some exhibition contests between a pair of junior lacrosse teams has turned into a five-day tournament. The five-team Survivor’s Cup U-19 Showcase will begin tomorrow and continue until Aug. 22 in Akwesasne, Ont. Back in June, representatives from the Akwesasne Indians Junior B squad had discussions with officials of the Orangeville Northmen Junior A squad. The thinking was to have the Orangeville club come to Akwesasne as part of a cultural exchange. The two sides would compete in a couple of exhibition contests and the exchange would allow the visitors to have a better understanding of the cultural importance of lacrosse to Mohawk people. The Mohawk territory of Akwesasne is unique since its land is not only in Ontario but also spreads into the province of Quebec and the state of New York. All matches for the Survivor’s Cup will be held at the Anowara’kowa Arena, located in the Ontario portion of Akwesasne. When word got out about these possible games, other teams expressed interest in taking part. That’s how the event expanded to become a five-club affair. Also taking part will be an all-star entry called Tri-Nation, comprised of players from Kahnawake Mohawk Territory and the First Nations Lacrosse Association, as well as two more Junior B entrants, the Mimico Mountaineers and Nepean Knights. The tournament moniker of Survivor’s Cup is to honour those who attended residential schools in Canada. “It’s in recognition of the travesty of what has happened with Native people,” said Perry Blanchard, a co-chair of the tournament. Proceeds from the event will also go to worthwhile causes, including suicide prevention and mental health programs. “I think that is really important, especially with all that we have been through the last couple of years,” Blanchard said. Besides the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Blanchard believes people’s mental health has suffered because of news of Indigenous children’s remains being located in unmarked, undisclosed graves at various former residential school sites, as well as the racism against Black, Indigenous and other peopled of colour, including incidences highlighted by the Black Lives Matter movement, and of the ugliness associated with the 2020 U.S. presidential election. “It’s been a huge strain on mental health,” Blanchard said. “I think this is a good opportunity to give back to some charities.” Blanchard said tournament organizers have not established a goal of how much they are hoping they will be able to donate to charity. The plan, however, is to donate 75 per cent of the tournament proceeds. Due to pandemic restrictions, a maximum of 400 spectators will be allowed for all tournament games. Those wishing to attend the event must purchase a $100 pass since single-game tickets are not being sold. Those who wish to livestream some action can purchase games for $9.99 each. Links will be available through the tournament’s Facebook page and Twitter account at https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064502925944 and https://twitter.com/SurvivorsCup Spectators, however, will be able to buy a $10 ticket ($8 for Elders and students) for a special exhibition contest that will be staged in conjunction with the tourney. The Hickory Classic, scheduled for 4 p.m. on Aug. 21, will feature a pair of men’s teams from the First Nations Lacrosse Association, the Akwesasne Bucks and the Snake Island Muskies. All participants in this contest must use wooden sticks, which were the norm in lacrosse games of yesteryear, instead of plastic sticks which are commonly utilized today in the sport. “There were no plastic sticks in the ‘60s and ‘70s,” Blanchard said. “It was a totally different style of game. It’s like a work of art. You are able to do fakes easier with a wooden stick than you are with a plastic one. It’s pretty unique and it’s a lot of fun.” As for the junior entrants, they will play a round-robin format, squaring off against all of their opponents once, resulting in a guarantee of four games. The top four finishers will then battle in gold-medal and bronze-medal matches on Sunday. Blanchard is also thrilled to see some junior lacrosse players, who had both their 2020 and ’21 lacrosse seasons cancelled because of the pandemic, back on the floor for tournament action. “It’s good experience for the kids looking to go to U.S. schools,” Blanchard said, adding he anticipates some American collegiate talent seekers as well as some scouts from the professional National Lacrosse League to take in the tournament action.

"2021-09-21","Full text: Indigenous engagement for the development of a strategy for the storage of low and intermediate radioactive waste has been hampered by more pressing concerns, including the coronavirus pandemic and forest fires blazing in many regions of the country. “I think it's been a difficult time for the Indigenous communities,” said Karine Glenn, strategic project director for the Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO). “It’s just taking a little bit longer simply because of the other priorities they have in their communities.” However, Glenn stresses those voices are important as the NWMO holds virtual engagement sessions that will inform their recommendations to the Natural Resources minister on a long-term strategy for the handling and storage of low and intermediate radioactive waste. These consultations do not focus on used nuclear fuel, but instead on low-level waste, like mops, gloves, paper towels and other day-to-day tools of operations, and intermediate waste, such as the resins that filter the pool water. “The Nuclear Waste Management Organization believes that Indigenous people have a really integral and important role to play. These kinds of projects cannot proceed without having Indigenous support,” said Glenn. The NWMO has a reconciliation policy in which it recognizes the historical wrongs that have been perpetrated against Indigenous peoples in Canada and are “really committed to building a better future together with Indigenous communities,” said Glenn. NWMO respects Indigenous treaty rights and incorporates Indigenous traditional knowledge into their projects, she adds. Glenn points to a three-day NWMO-hosted Canadian radioactive waste summit in March, in which one-quarter of the 65 speakers, facilitators and panel members were Indigenous. Of the 500 registrants, 15 per cent self-identified as Indigenous. On Aug. 26, NWMO will host a virtual engagement session in Alberta on the development of a federal integrated strategy for radioactive waste. However, it won’t be the only opportunity for Indigenous communities or organizations to take part, says Glenn. NWMO is offering to work with any Indigenous community across the country who is interested in “having a dialogue” to set up forums or formats. The discussions in Alberta are particularly timely as this past April the province joined New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan in signing a Memorandum of Understanding that commits them to collaborate in advancing Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as a source of clean energy. SMRs are nuclear reactors that produce 300 MW of electricity or less and are seen as an alternative to diesel-generated power in isolated and northern communities. At this point, says Glenn, Alberta has no nuclear waste or nuclear generation. “Moving forward with nuclear energy, if that was the path that Alberta would wish to move forward with, doesn't necessarily mean that they would host a disposal facility, so that's not necessary. But I think it's important that if you agree to in the future to having nuclear energy as part of your energy policy in the province, you also get an opportunity to participate in a dialogue about the long-term management of its waste,” she said. There are numerous options for storing this level of radioactive waste: This kind of radioactive waste, says Glenn, does not require a deep geological repository as does used nuclear fuel. Instead, it can be stored “just below (the surface) tens of metres deep,” according to the international best practice. Regardless of the type of radioactive waste that is being stored, Glenn stresses that all facilities are designed to ensure public safety. There are economic benefits to a community that hosts the waste site, she adds, including jobs during the construction phase and for operating and monitoring the facilities. However, Glenn is quick to point out, this phase of the consultation does not involve the site of the repositories, and NWMO has not been tasked with recommending sites. “We’re at the step before that. We are looking to say what kind of facility we should build and how many of them should be build,” she said. Glenn does not anticipate the recently called federal election to delay the consultation process as NWMO’s work is funded by the waste owners and not the government. However, it will delay the final recommendations she had hoped to deliver to the minister by the end of 2021. The government needs to revise its radioactive waste policy framework and that was supposed to be completed in early fall. However, Canadians will be going to the polls Sept. 20. While the delivery of the recommendations will be delayed, Glenn is confident that the consultations will be valuable. “There could be some policy direction that might limit the number of options that are available to us, if the government legislated specific technical options for instance. But it wouldn’t necessarily change a lot of what we're asking people… Those concerns and those considerations will be the same regardless of the policy direction,” she said. To date, 10 community engagement sessions have taken place in New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. Saskatchewan will follow the Alberta consultation. The NWMO has met with the First Nations Power Authority, the Assembly of First Nations, the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan, and the Wolastoqey Nation of New Brunswick. A meeting is planned with the Pabineau First Nation, N.B., and workshops are being arranged with the Grand Treaty Council #3, the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians, Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, and Sagkeeng First Nation. Workshops in all nine regions of the Métis Nation of Ontario are underway, and meetings are planned with the Historical Saugeen Métis and the Métis Nation—Saskatchewan. Glenn says other Indigenous organizations have been contacted, as well as Treaty 6 chiefs, the Treaty 8 First Nations and the Métis Nation of Alberta. Glenn expects engagements to conclude by October or November. “When we’re talking about long-term management of waste we're talking into the hundreds and thousands of years. We want to make sure we get it right and we need to hear from as many people as possible,” said Glenn. The Indian Resource Council (IRC) has not been approached about the virtual consultations, says Larry Kaida, assistant to the president. IRC, headquartered in Tsuut’ina Nation, represents about 140 First Nations who have produced oil and gas in the past, are producing now or have the potential to produce. “The IRC is now looking at all forms of energy so long as there are benefits/opportunities for First Nations. We would, of course, be very cognizant of environmental issues and impacts. We are well placed to coordinate meetings, provide the right information, but leave it to First Nations to decide if interested,” said Kaida in an email to Windspeaker.com.

The announcement raises new questions about the government's promise to help hundreds of former interpreters and their families who are still stuck in the country. The prime minister revealed during an election campaign event in the Toronto area that a total of nine flights out of Afghanistan have arrived in Canada over the past few weeks.

"2021-08-19","Full text: Ontario open to Liberal child-care deal TORONTO - Ontario's education minister says his government is open to striking a deal on affordable child care with the federal Liberals if it accounts for what he described as the province's ""unique"" circumstances. Stephen Lecce told a conference on Monday that Ontario's Progressive Conservatives were in discussions about a potential child care plan ""into the last hours"" before the federal election was called on Sunday. The federal Liberals have promised to spend $30 billion over the next five years to cut child care costs to an average of $10 a day across the country. They had committed to bilateral agreements on that pledge with eight provinces and two territories before Parliament was dissolved. But Ontario -- Canada's largest province -- remained a noteworthy holdout, along with Alberta. Lecce said Monday that he wants a child-care agreement to reflect the specific characteristics of Ontario, including the fact that a large percentage of Canadian kids requiring child care live in the province. He said he'd also want Ontario's existing full-day kindergarten program, which incorporates early learning elements, reflected in any final deal. ""We're very committed to a good deal for Ontario, but it must respond to the unique advantages of this province,” Lecce said when asked whether Ontario would strike an agreement on child care with the federal Liberals. ""What I can confirm to you is we are open and actively interested in a program that achieves the imperative of affordability and accessibility, while also ensuring an element of flexibility."" He added that Ontario would work on more affordable child care with whatever federal government is elected in September. The federal Conservatives have said that if elected, they would scrap agreements inked with provinces in favour of a refundable tax credit. The party says their proposed credit would cover up to 75 per cent of child care costs for lower-income families. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 16, 2021.

"2021-08-18","Full text: Councillor Matt Connell has lived in Whitecourt since he was 13 years old. The community he first stepped into is a far cry from the one in which his grandson will now grow up. “My dad was in the oilfield, which meant we moved around a lot. Whitecourt had a great smalltown feel, and it opened up doors that might not have opened up in a bigger municipality,” explained Connell. “There was also a tremendous amount of freedom growing up in a small town. As I grew up, Whitecourt grew with me.” Connell said that he credited past councils for having a vision of what the community could become. “Past councils and past administrations helped make this community a place where industry wanted to come.” Watching it change from a more transient place to a blossoming family-oriented municipality is a view that helped form his own passions to run for town council one day. “We are always moving forward. You can raise a family here, but you can also grow old here and retire here. We are cut right out of the forest, and we have so much to do here recreationally. Look at Carson Pegasus. It’s the best campground; I love it. Why would I go anywhere else when that is 20 minutes out of town? I have all these things that are so amazing that it doesn’t leave me necessarily wanting more,” smiled Connell. As he wraps up a four-year term, Connell said that recognizing how great an administration Whitecourt has is one of several “eureka moments” he fondly looks back on. “There’s a reason why Whitecourt looks the way it does and why we are in the financial shape that we are in. It’s because of past councils making good long-term decisions for the future of Whitecourt, and Administration is constantly working hard to go after grants.” The 20-Year-Capital Plan was one of those big “eureka moments” for him. “We would be talking about things and would ask, do we have the money for that? And the answer would be yes because past councils decided 15 years ago to start putting away money for it.” Connell said sometimes he wonders if 15-20 years from now someone will look back and be thankful for the decisions council made while he was on it just as he looks back now. “We had a rec centre (AJMC) long before any town our size had one, and that was visionary. They knew we were going to need this in future, so, past councils thought, since they were good with their money, why not do it now since we can afford it? That’s how incredible Whitecourt is,” he explained. Connell said the proposed Municipal Centre, which encompasses a new library, better sized for the community, a performing arts auditorium, and a town office, could be the next big thing. “If there was ever a hole in Whitecourt, maybe it’s entertainment. The time might be right now where we could stay ahead of everyone and be a trailblazer. We’ve had successes with being a trailblazer already, so why not this? Imagine having a great convention in Whitecourt or a concert? I believe in it.” For those who haven’t heard, Connell is not seeking re-election this fall. He feels there are people just as passionate that could be great additions to the round table. “If you love your community, being a councillor is a great opportunity to show your love. For four years, I was part of shaping my community, and I am proud of that.” After looking into a bylaw issue and receiving help from then Councillor Darlene Chartrand, Connell said he wanted to be that councillor for someone else like she was for him. “I wanted to help people, and I did a lot of listening. Being approachable has always been part of my skill set, and I feel I accomplished that. I’m good at bringing people together and having understanding. That’s why I encouraged my brother, Adam, to run because we think alike, and he loves this community.” Connell said it’s crucial to get in, share your ideas and then get out so that new people can get in and share their ideas. “I think sometimes people are reluctant to run because they think they will fail against an incumbent or something. I worked hard, ran, got elected, and I think the last four years were successful. Now, I think it’s time to let someone else be successful.” Connell said that he sees things differently now, such as taxation or getting stuck at the train and that he has also helped others see it differently. “No matter where we live, we have to pay property taxes, and when I look at what Whitecourt does with them, I can be proud of that. When I’m sitting at the train, and yes, sometimes it’s 20-25 minutes, I think of why it’s there. They are picking up wood at Millar Western, who is a tremendous employer and taxpayer in our town.” Married for 24 years to his beautiful wife Sarah, the father of three looks to the future with excitement and is eager to see what the next council will do. “As a taxpayer and not as a councillor, I want to see a more robust conversation around regionalization. There is so much duplicity, and I would love to see bigger borders. There’s stuff that Whitecourt provides, and there’s stuff that Woodlands County provides.” As someone who lives in town and works in the county, Connell said regionalization could clean up inefficiencies and build strong partnerships between Whitecourt and Woodlands County. “Imagine there is no red tape between the municipalities. Businesses think about that, and they will want to come here. I want people to talk about it in the way of what’s best for the community.” Subject: Councils"

Houston told supporters in the Halifax-area that no one gave his party a chance at the start of the campaign. But he says his campaign hit on a winning message by almost exclusively focusing on the need to invest more money in health-care. Liberal leader Iain Rankin and N-D-P leader Gary Burrill are also on the campaign trail making their last pitches to voters for their support. (The Canadian Press) --- (NS-Indigenous-Lobster) Nova Scotia's Sipekne'katik (sah-BAY'-ghen-nah-gah-dee) First Nation says it will carry on with a self-regulated ""treaty"" fishery in St. Marys Bay. Chief Mike Sack says he expects Fisheries Department officers to pull some of his band's traps out of the water because they aren't licensed by Ottawa. He says he was taken to the D-F-O department this afternoon for questioning about his band's plans. The band also launched a self-regulated lobster fishery outside the federally regulated season last September, which led to violence and the burning of a lobster pound that stored Indigenous catch.

Five are in the Fredericton region, three are in the Miramichi area and 32 are in the Moncton zone -- which has been seeing an outbreak mainly among those who are unvaccinated or only partly vaccinated.

"2021-09-22","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Aug. 16 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 16 ... What we are watching in Canada ... OTTAWA — The first full day of the federal election campaign begins today with Justin Trudeau making an announcement in Quebec. The Liberal leader is set to leave Longueuil, Que., after a 10 a.m. news conference and make his way to Cobourg, Ont., with several stops along the way. Shortly after Trudeau's morning announcement, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will make one of his own in Toronto -- a Liberal stronghold he's hoping to turn orange. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole is sticking to Ottawa today, though he has ""virtual telephone town halls"" with communities in Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario planned for the evening. But he starts the day with what his team is billing as a ""major announcement."" Gov. Gen. Mary Simon dissolved parliament yesterday morning at Trudeau's request, and voters head to the polls Sept. 20. --- Also this ... VANCOUVER — Blustery winds are fanning several wildfires in British Columbia, forcing hundreds of people from their homes late Sunday. Some of the biggest and most dangerous fires are blazing in the southern Interior in the Kamloops fire centre. The BC Wildfire Service says there are at least a dozen fires in the district and that 29 evacuation orders have been issued affecting over 1,400 properties. The City of Kamloops issued an evacuation order for about 700 properties, hundreds of homes were also ordered evacuated in the Township of Spallumcheen and the Okanagan Indian Band told residents in 80 properties to leave. Wildfire Information Officer Erika Berg says strong winds kicked up mid-afternoon Sunday pushing flames past containment lines in several fires -- and those conditions are expected to continue today. The City of Armstrong with a population of about five thousand people has also been placed on evacuation alert as the massive White Rock Lake fire comes to within about 20 kilometers of the city. There are about 270 blazes burning in B-C -- more than 30 of them are wildfires of note, meaning they're either highly visible or considered a danger to the public. --- And this ... VANCOVER — Meng Wanzhou's legal team is expected to argue today there is no evidence showing the Huawei executive caused international bank HSBC to violate U.S. sanctions law. The B.C. Supreme Court is hearing formal arguments in the extradition case for the telecom executive that began last week amid rising diplomatic tensions. Meng, who is Huawei's chief financial officer and daughter of the company's founder, was arrested at Vancouver's airport in 2018 at the request of the United States in a move that fractured Canada's relationship with China. She says she is innocent of U.S. fraud charges that are based on allegations she misled HSBC in a 2013 presentation about Huawei's control of another company that did business in Iran. Lawyers for Canada's attorney general have said the alleged lies would clearly constitute fraud in Canada and Meng should be surrendered to face prosecution in the United States. The case is scheduled to continue through Friday, although lawyers have said they are on track to wrap up mid-week. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... WASHINGTON — U.S. officials say the evacuation of the American Embassy in Kabul has been completed. President Joe Biden and other top U.S. officials have been stunned by the Taliban’s nearly complete takeover of Afghanistan as the planned withdrawal of American forces urgently became a mission to ensure a safe evacuation from the country. The speed of the Afghan government’s collapse and the ensuing chaos posed the most serious test of Biden as commander in chief, and he has become the subject of withering criticism from Republicans who say that he has failed. Meanwhile, America’s top general says the United States could now face a rise in terrorist threats from a Taliban-run Afghanistan. That warning comes as intelligence agencies charged with anticipating those threats face new questions after the U.S.-backed Afghan military collapsed with shocking speed. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, told senators on a briefing call Sunday that U.S. officials are expected to alter their earlier assessments about the pace of terrorist groups reconstituting in Afghanistan. That's according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. --- Also this ... WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has approved a significant and permanent increase in the levels of food stamp assistance available to needy families — the largest single increase in the program’s history. Starting in October, average benefits for food stamps — officially known as the SNAP program — will rise more than 25 percent above pre-pandemic levels. The increased assistance will be available indefinitely to all 42 million SNAP beneficiaries. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... KABUL —The U.S. military has taken over Afghanistan’s airspace as it struggles to manage a chaotic evacuation after the Taliban rolled into the capital. The militants, meanwhile, have been trying to project calm amid widespread fears of looting and violence. The Taliban swept into the capital on Sunday after the Western-backed government collapsed and the president fled the country. Thousands of Afghans, fearing a return to the Taliban’s brutal rule, are trying to flee. Videos circulating on social media showed hundreds of people racing across the tarmac of the international airport as U.S. soldiers fired warning shots in the air. The U.S. Embassy has been evacuated and the American flag lowered. Canada has also closed its embassy in Kabul and suspended its diplomatic missing to Afghanistan. --- Also this ... LES CAYES, Haiti — Many of the Haitians injured during a powerful earthquake over the weekend are lying in the open, under burning heat, waiting for help as hospitals overflow with patients. Thousands more in the quake zone are sleeping outside for a second night, clutching small transistor radios tuned to the news. Officials have raised the death toll from Saturday's earthquake to at least 1,297. And the devastation could soon worsen. Tropical depression Grace is predicted to reach Haiti tonight, bringing the potential for heavy rain, flooding and landslides. The country's Civil Protection Agency says the magnitude 7.2 earthquake also left at least 5,700 people injured. --- ICYMI ... Scientists from the Washington State Department of Agriculture say they've found the first so-called live murder hornet for the year. In a news release Thursday, entomologists say the Asian giant hornet was seen about a kilometre from the U.S.-Canada border. They say the hornet was reported by a Whatcom County resident on Wednesday and confirmed the following day where a photograph showed it attacking a paper wasp nest, about three kilometres from where the department eradicated a nest last October. They say U.S. and B.C. officials will be setting up traps in the area to catch a live hornet, tag it and track it back to its nest. The five-centimetre-long invasive insects are the world's biggest hornets and prey on honey bees and other hornets -- a small group can kill an entire honey bee hive in a matter of hours. While they are not particularly aggressive toward humans, in rare cases a person stung repeatedly by murder hornets could die. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 16, 2021 Subject: Airports; Diplomatic & consular services; Earthquakes; Forest & brush fires; Military withdrawals"

"2021-08-16","Full text: Final weekend of N.S. election campaign underway HALIFAX - The last weekend of Nova Scotia's election campaign began with the three main party leaders trying to shore up votes in competitive ridings across the province ahead of Tuesday's vote. Liberal Leader Iain Rankin travelled to three electoral districts along the South Shore on Saturday where he again highlighted his party's plan to twin areas of the province's major highways. One of the stops was in the Chester-St. Margaret's riding, which is expected to produce a tight three-way race between the Liberals, Tories and NDP. Rankin said a re-elected Liberal government would apply to a federal program to twin Highway 103 from Hubbards to Bridgewater and Highway 104 from Antigonish to Port Hawkesbury, with the province's share of the cost for the two projects pegged at $237 million. ""These commitments are about ensuring Nova Scotians, especially those living in the rural parts of the province, can travel efficiently and safely on well-maintained and accessible roads,” Rankin said in a news release. In addition, he said the Liberals would expand the gravel road improvement program first announced in 2017 by 50 per cent to $30 million, and would also double the amount allotted to repairing rural roads to $22 million. Rankin was scheduled to campaign in two Halifax ridings later Saturday. NDP Leader Gary Burrill was in Cape Breton where he again stressed his health plan for the island during stops in three Sydney, N.S.,-area ridings. The New Democrats are expected to put up a stiff fight in the area and are looking to make inroads in other parts of Cape Breton and in their traditional stronghold of Halifax-Dartmouth. The NDP unveiled its health plan for Cape Breton earlier in the campaign, with promises to keep hospitals open in New Waterford, N.S., and North Sydney, N.S. that are currently slated for closure. He also pledged to create 400 more long-term care beds and to establish a mobile mental health crisis response team on the island. ""Time and again Iain Rankin and the Liberals have abandoned Cape Bretoners when it comes to health care,"" Burrill said in a news release. Meanwhile, Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Houston began the day in the western part of the province and the Annapolis Valley before moving on to campaign in several Halifax area ridings. Both areas include ridings where the Tories hope to make inroads. Houston has almost singularly focused on the need to fix the province's health system and is using the final days of the campaign to hammer away at what's seen as a vulnerability for the incumbent Liberals. He entered the weekend having won an endorsement for his party's health stance on Friday from Denise Peterson-Rafuse, who was a member of former NDP premier Darrell Dexter's cabinet. Houston's campaign issued a news release that talked about emergency room closures at the Roseway Hospital in Shelburne, N.S. Tory candidate Nolan Young noted the emergency room was closed for 30 per cent of 2020. ""We need a government with health care solutions so that our community can have the comfort of knowing that if they have a medical emergency, they can access care,” said Young.

The federal parks agency says the berries are an important food source for animals and insects in the area, and an untouched wild berry crop will only help these creatures survive. Signal Hill overlooks downtown St. John's and is home to a popular hiking trail that winds through wide, rocky areas carpeted in low-lying blueberry bushes.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Derek Fox is the new grand chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN), elected to replace Alvin Fiddler who has held the post for six years. Fox, of the Bearskin Lake First Nation, has served as a deputy grand chief from 2015 to 2021, holding the Education, Justice, Language and Youth portfolios. . Fox won the election 30 votes to 11 for Bruce Shisheesh, a former chief of Attawapiskat First Nation. Eligible voters were chiefs or their proxies from the 49 communities from across northern Ontario that belong to the NAN, which represents about 45,000 people. The election was held as part of the 39th annual Keewaywin Conference, taking place virtually this year from Aug. 10 to Aug. 12. Trained as a lawyer, Fox has practiced civil litigation with a focus on Aboriginal, corporate and commercial law, according to a news release from NAN. He previously had a successful career in major junior and semi-pro hockey, according to a biography on the NAN website. He earned a degree in Political Science and Economics from the University of Manitoba, and then completed his law degree there. Fox told the chiefs and viewers of the virtual event, held at the Fort William First Nation, adjacent to Thunder Bay, that one of his first priorities will be to “play a huge role” in helping with the search for unmarked graves at the sites of former residential schools. Describing himself as the child of two school survivors, Fox said he wants to “make sure those who never came home are found and that the families of those survivors find some comfort” in the search process. He also pledged to “keep a close eye on” the COVID pandemic and help students get back to school safely. “We are still in the time of COVID,” he reminded the assembly, and that “many students are struggling. They just want to go to school, they don’t want to be cooped up at home anymore.” Fox said another of his priorities will be to try and visit as many communities as possible to hear from their leadership and the people. “I want to hear your issues and your vision,” he said. Promoting the “Choose Life” program that provides services for youth at risk of suicide among member communities is also important to the new grand chief, Fox said. A nation can qualify for Choose Life if the communities have “a pressing need in respect to youth at serious risk of suicide” and a gap in supports, programs and services for those youth, according to the NAN website. The program provides one-on-one intervention, counselling, training of front-line staff and community members, youth-driven programming, and land-based cultural activities. Responding to questions held just before the vote, Fox said he has a vision of a possible territory-wide government one day that would implement self-government under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He also pledged to support the rights of individual First Nations to make their own health care arrangements with the federal government. Answering a question from Moose Cree First Nation Chief Marven Cheechoo, Fox said he wants to make sure the community’s hospital is not moved. Cheechoo said his nation has had a hospital for 70 years and fears a new health transformation plan will move it to the town of Moosonee. Three deputy grand chiefs were also elected who will form the 2021-2024 executive council— Anna Betty Achneepineskum of Marten Falls First Nation, Bobby Narcisse of Aroland First Nation and Victor H. Linklater of Taykwa Tagamou Nation. Leaving the grand chief’s post is Alvin Fiddler, who has held the job since 2015. He ran for the leadership of the Assembly of First Nations in July, pulling out after three ballots to support the eventual winner, RoseAnne Archibald, former head of the Chiefs of Ontario. Fox concluded his acceptance speech by promising to follow the lead of his people. “The people of NAN are the voice. It’s important their voices are heard. Over the next three years we are going to work extremely hard. I'm going to ensure I do this with honour and integrity and I acknowledge this is a very sacred role. We have a long line of grand chiefs for many years, and I will not take that for granted.” Windspeaker.com Subject: Native peoples; Community"

"2021-08-15","Full text: --- (BC-Wildfires) The B-C Wildfire Service says wildfires have burned six-thousand-600 square kilometres of land since the start of this year's fire season. The latest statistics from the wildfire service shows roughly 270 fires are currently burning, while nearly 15-hundred have been sparked since April 1st -- including 50 in the last week. Approximately 38-hundred people are on the fire lines, more than 400 of them from outside B-C. Evacuation orders currently affect 62-hundred properties while residents of more than 27-thousand properties are on evacuation alert and ready to leave on short notice. (The Canadian Press) --- --- (BC-Wildfires-Evacuations) Several expanded evacuation orders and alerts are in place across the southern Interior as bone-dry conditions, soaring temperatures and gusty winds complicate the battle against some of the nearly 270 wildfires burning in the province. About two-thousand residents of Logan Lake were ordered to leave the community southwest of Kamloops yesterday as the Tremont Creek wildfire chewed through its southern containment lines -- prompting an evacuation alert for properties to the east, including the community of Cherry Creek. Near Lillooet, an evacuation order has been expanded, affecting numerous properties along West Pavilion Road as officials say the six-week-old Mckay Creek wildfire showed ""extremely vigorous"" activity on its western flank yesterday. Further east, the 580-square kilometre White Rock Lake fire has prompted a renewed evacuation alert for some areas of Spallumcheen but the wildfire service says lines in the Paxton Valley near the fire-ravaged community of Monte Lake continue to hold. (The Canadian Press) --- --- (BC-Wildfires-Assistance) More help is on the way for beleaguered crews on the front lines of B-C's wildfires. Quebec has announced it is sending a 153-person team -- including 140 firefighters -- it's largest-ever contingent. The fresh crews are set to arrive Sunday in Abbotsford for a 14-day deployment. B-C has welcomed out-of-province firefighters from Quebec and New Brunswick -- and as far away as Mexico, since the fire season began. (The Canadian Press) --- --- (BC-Wildfires-Teck) Vancouver-based mining company Teck Resources is restarting the oxygen plant at its Trail production facility after a shutdown because of smoke from nearby wildfires. Oxygen is a necessary part of the lead smelting and zinc refining processes at the plant but a statement from Teck says poor air quality affected oxygen production, forcing the shutdown or reduction of work at its metallurgical facility. Teck says the facility is now ramping back up to full production. The company says it is actively monitoring regional air quality because there's still a risk of further smoke from wildfires and more shutdowns of the oxygen plant as long as the fire season continues. (The Canadian Press) --- --- (BC-Heat) Environment Canada says it will be Sunday before much of coastal and southern B-C sees any relief from a heat wave that has the potential to create life-threatening conditions for those unable to find cool shelter. The Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health authorities have issued an extreme heat alert, upgrading warnings issued for the region earlier this week. A statement from the health authorities says hot temperatures can be especially dangerous for the young, the elderly or ill, those working or exercising outside, people living alone or dealing with mental health issues, and the homeless or inadequately housed. Fifteen temperature records were set yesterday in B-C -- including highs in Victoria and Comox that shattered records set 101 years ago. (The Canadian Press) --- --- (Yukon-FedElxn-Conservatives) With a federal election call expected Sunday, Conservatives in Yukon are suddenly searching for a new candidate. Jonas Smith had won the nomination to run for the party and was preparing for the battle when a statement yesterday from the Conservative Party of Canada said he had been dropped. A release from Smith's campaign office says he was axed for his opposition to mandated workplace vaccinations and vaccine passport requirements -- and the decision will be ""devastating"" for the Conservative movement in Yukon. The party's website for the Yukon Conservative Association still shows Smith as the candidate and there is no indication when a new nomination meeting might be held.

Former provincial N-D-P community services minister Denise Peterson-Rafuse joined P-C leader Tim Houston on the campaign trail today. Peterson-Rafuse says she never thought she'd support the Tories -- but she likes their health care platform and the way Houston has distanced himself from his more right-leaning federal counterparts. She also says she feels the N-D-P is not ready to govern because it has many new members who would face a steep learning curve if they came to power.

The lawyer for Bombardier Chelsea Cogswell argued one cupcake wrapper that tested positive for T-H-C should not be allowed because it's not an indication of what may have been found on the others. The defence also argued those other wrappers were discarded because of negligence. But the judge has ruled that while military police could have done a better investigation, there's no indication of negligence. (The Canadian Press) --- (COVID-NL) Newfoundland and Labrador has announced four new cases of COVID-19. Three cases in the Eastern Health region are linked to international travel and another case in Labrador-Grenfell is related to travel within Canada. There have been two new recoveries, leaving the province with seven active cases of COVID-19. One person remains in hospital due to the virus -- a crewmember aboard a ship that had been anchored off the coast of Bay Bulls. (The Canadian Press) --- (COVID-NS) Nova Scotia is reporting two new cases of COVID-19 and no recoveries. One case in Northern Zone is related to travel and another in the Eastern Zone is under investigation. The number of active cases in the province has increased to 26, including one person in intensive care.

St. Stephen R-C-M-P say the crash last night in Rollingdam is believed to have occurred when the driver lost control and the vehicle rolled over. The man from Brockway was the only occupant of the vehicle and died at the scene. The investigation is ongoing but police say speed and alcohol are believed to be contributing factors in the crash.

"2021-08-15","Full text: O'Toole seeks intervener status in lab docs case OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole is seeking to intervene in a Federal Court case where the Liberal government is trying to shield documents related to the firing of two scientists from Canada's highest-security laboratory. O'Toole's lawyer has filed a letter with the court saying the leader of the official Opposition has a significant interest and distinct perspective on the underlying issues raised by the case. The Liberal government asked the court last month to affirm a prohibition on disclosure of records concerning the dismissal of Xiangguo Qiu and her husband, Keding Cheng, from Winnipeg's National Microbiology Laboratory. Speaker Anthony Rota has filed a motion to strike the court action, saying the House of Commons has the power to request the ""persons, papers and records"" it deems necessary for its functions. O'Toole says in a statement he is taking the ""necessary steps"" to challenge Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in court and end the ""coverup"" of the Winnipeg lab documents. Trudeau is expected to ask the Governor General to dissolve Parliament on Sunday, triggering an election campaign, and O'Toole says if he becomes prime minister he will release the documents in his first 100 days. “I will not stand by while Justin Trudeau’s corrupt Liberal government undermines the supremacy of Parliament, and the right of Canadians to know the extent to which the federal government was partnering with scientists associated with the Chinese military,"" he says. The federal government filed the court case in June shortly after Rota reprimanded Public Health Agency of Canada head Iain Stewart over his repeated refusal to provide the unredacted documents to MPs on the Canada-China relations committee. Stewart has advised the attorney general in a notice under the Canada Evidence Act that sensitive or potentially injurious information would be revealed should the documents be given to the committee. After considering the notice, the attorney general filed a court application requesting an order confirming the documents should remain under wraps. Opposition parties have joined forces to demand the documents in hope that they'll shed light on why scientists Qiu and Cheng were escorted out of the lab July 2019 and subsequently fired last January. They also seek documents related to the transfer, overseen by Qiu, of deadly Ebola and Henipah viruses to China's Wuhan Institute of Virology in March 2019. The letter from O'Toole's lawyer says if intervener status is granted, O'Toole will make submissions to the court on various issues including the unique scope of parliamentary privilege and its evolution in the courts. He will also speak to the role of Parliament in Canada's constitutional structure and its unfettered discretion to call on individuals and request documents ""to conduct the business of the nation,"" the letter says. It adds O'Toole's submissions will focus on ""the real and substantial risks to our democratic processes and to future Parliaments, governments, and opposition members if the scope of these privileges are abrogated, interfered with, or unduly constrained."" A hearing on Rota's motion to strike has been scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17. O'Toole's lawyer is requesting a case conference for the court to deal with his motion to intervene.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Ex-defence minister Paul Hellyer dies at 98 Paul Theodore Hellyer, the influential former federal defence minister, has died at the age of 98. Hellyer fell and struck his head on June 19, losing the ability to walk and temporarily losing the ability to speak. He convalesced at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto for about a month before returning home. He died there on Aug. 8. “The doctors were surprised he recovered as much as he did,” said Josh Hellyer. “My grandfather didn’t want to die in a hospital, he wanted to be at his home with his family. We celebrated his 98th birthday together just two days before he passed, and he made his goodbyes to everyone individually. His was a life well lived.” Born near Waterford, Ont., on Aug. 6, 1923, Hellyer took an interest in aviation at a young age, studying aeronautical engineering, earning a pilot’s licence and building training aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War. He also served as an artillery gunner in the Canadian Army late in the conflict. Hellyer was once the youngest member of the House of Commons, elected to Parliament in 1949 just shy of his 26th birthday, and in the same year he earned his bachelor’s degree. His interest in defence matters led to serving as parliamentary assistant to the defence minister and then associate minister of national defence in the government of Louis St. Laurent. Hellyer was briefly unseated after the 1957 election, but returned to the House of Commons after a byelection in 1958. Hellyer rose to prominence as a critic of the Diefenbaker administration and then as minister of national defence in Lester B. Pearson’s cabinet. Few defence ministers would be as consequential as Hellyer, who urged Canada to accept nuclear weapons after several years of acrimonious public debate on the matter in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Hellyer was also responsible for the controversial decision to unify and integrate the service branches of the Canadian military into a single organization, the Canadian Armed Forces. Despite the opposition to the idea at the time, the military remains a unified force to this day. Hellyer’s time in cabinet led to a brief friendship with U.S. president John F. Kennedy. His lifelong fascination with aircraft and cutting-edge technology led president Lyndon B. Johnson to invite Hellyer to fly in Air Force 1 for a demonstration of the aircraft’s state-of-the-art communications equipment. “He was always interested in technology, it kept him young,” said Josh Hellyer. In the late 1960s, Paul Hellyer spearheaded a federal task force on housing and urban development, one that ultimately recommended against the then-popular trend of wholesale demolition of older housing stock and its replacement by large housing projects. A dispute with Pierre Trudeau over the implementation of the plan resulted in Hellyer leaving cabinet and eventually sitting as an Independent before accepting an invitation to join Robert Stanfield’s Progressive Conservatives. Hellyer also holds the distinction of having challenged both Trudeau and Joe Clark for the leadership of the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties, in 1968 and 1976, respectively. He returned to the Liberal party in 1982. Hellyer also created two federal political parties during his life: Action Canada in 1971, and the Canadian Action Party in 1997. Hellyer advocated a unique blend of civic nationalism, antiglobalization and monetary reform policies, attracting supporters from across the Canadian political spectrum. He was also the longest-serving member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada at the time of his death."
"2021-08-15","Full text: The federal government has signed an agreement with the territorial government that will allow construction to start on a recovery centre in Iqaluit to help Nunavummiut dealing with substance abuse. Northern Affairs Minister Daniel Vandal held a public event at the Aqsarniit hotel Friday to announce the signing. The announcement follows a declaration the two governments signed in 2019, where the federal government agreed to pay $41.7 million — or 75 per cent — of the centre’s construction costs and $9.7 annually for operational costs. Friday’s agreement formalizes these contributions and “defines our respective roles and responsibilities for the construction and operation” of the centre, said Vandal. He did not provide detail about what those respective roles and responsibilities will be. The Nunavut government hasn’t confirmed where the recovery centre will be located, but Health Minister Lorne Kusugak said his department is still looking at a parcel of land close to the Arctic Winter Games Arena and north of Toonik Pond. That proposal was presented to Iqaluit city councillors in March. There is no timeline for construction to begin, Kusugak said, but he did say the government is aiming to start with the next shipping season when building materials can be brought to the territory. This project has been a long time coming, said Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. president Aluki Kotierk, adding the organization first asked for a recovery centre in 2010, then again in 2013. “Even prior to those resolutions, even prior to the creation of Nunavut, Inuit have wanted to have a residential treatment centre here in Nunavut,” she said. Vandal made another funding announcement at the same location Thursday that more than $500 million of $4.3 billion announced in April will be earmarked for infrastructure across Inuit Nunangat. The federal Liberal government had set aside the larger sum over three years for infrastructure in Indigenous communities, such as deepsea ports, energy projects, roads and housing. “[The funding] will work towards addressing the immediate needs of Inuit as prioritized by Inuit,” Vandal said. Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Natan Obed called the infrastructure funding a “good starting point,” but that it won’t fix all of Inuit Nunangat’s lacking infrastructure. “We [have] lived in an infrastructure deficit since the very beginning of the relationship between Inuit and the Government of Canada,” he said. “This long-standing inequity is a result of a mindset that does not see Inuit communities as important or as equal to other Canadian communities.” Duane Ningaqsiq Smith, CEO of Inuvialuit Regional Corporation in the Northwest Territories, also said the funding is a good start, but that he wants the federal government to commit to a long-term strategy to address the region’s larger needs. “I’m sure each of the leaders from around the table today could say that they can use this level of funds alone just within each of our regions, just to try to start to catch up,” he said. “This is a drop in the bucket.” In response to those critiques, Vandal said during the media’s question period that the money announced Thursday was the “most significant amount of money any government in recent memory has invested in Indigenous infrastructure.” “The issue is, we are battling generations and generations of underfunding,” he said. Both announcements came at the tail end of the minister’s trip to Nunavut, where he also visited Arviat, Pond Inlet and Rankin Inlet. Vandal is the latest of four Liberal cabinet ministers to visit Nunavut and announce investments in the North since late July — a riding in which the party does not have a candidate, despite speculation a federal election could be be called next week.

"2021-08-15","Full text: Money for the Moyie The Village of Kaslo will be throwing its support behind the Kootenay Lake Historical Society’s project to renovate and weatherproof the SS Moyie. Council approved the KLHS’s request for a $10,000 grant from the Community Development Fund. It’s a small fraction of the cost of the two-year, $618,000 project to protect the historic paddlewheeler for another generation. But it’s an important one, as it proves local support to other funding agencies. Pride approval The annual Kaslo Pride weekend is coming up August 28-29, and organizers have asked council for permission to refresh the downtown’s rainbow crosswalk, including a street closure and other support for the event. Staff said they were waiting to hear back on a request to change the road closure time to later in the day, and that local businesses have been made aware of the request, as set out in the bylaw. “The group had requested the 3 pm start time, but being a summer weekend, we know how busy traffic is downtown,” said CAO Ian Dunlop. “So we’re trying to see if they’ll settle for a later start time of 5-5:30, so we can close down the intersection and not have any disruption.” That had councillor Henry Van Mill wondering if it couldn’t be rescheduled. “So why can’t they do it during the week? When it’s not so busy?” he said. “Doesn’t it interfere quite a bit with tourism? Just a question.” Council made no further comment, receiving the request for the street closure and tabling the discussion to its August meeting. Flag flap Two letters to council raised the issue of why the Village had re-raised its flag at City Hall just before Canada Day. It was supposed to be kept at half-mast while the nation observes mourning for the hundreds of children found in unmarked graves at residential schools across the country. The mayor said any offence was unintentional, and steps were being taken to address its relationship with First Nations (see “Village staff apologize after flag raised to full mast”, page XX) Why don’t we do it to the road? While people living on the Kaslo Back Road rejected a plan to pave their road last month (citing concerns about traffic and speeding), some of them have asked council to look into hard-topping the Village’s part of the same street. “We live on or near the Back Road and would like that portion from J Ave. to Balfour Ave. to be paved,” wrote petitioner Phil Trotter, whose letter was signed by 10 other residents. “The dust from this portion of the road is quite bad even though it has been sprayed with calcium.” They sent a petition to council to show wide neighbourhood support for the move. Council deferred making any decision now, but asked staff to pencil the request into the 2022 capital budget wish list. CAO duties now down-loadable A bit of a refresh to the Village’s Municipal Officer Bylaw will make work a little more reasonable for the Village’s Chief Administrative Officer. Council has approved revisions to the bylaw to allow others in the municipal government to take on certain duties. That will allow CAO Ian Dunlop to delegate some of his corporate officer duties to other staff people as need warrants. “The Municipal Officer bylaw hasn’t been updated in nearly 20 years, since 2003,” Dunlop told council. “The legislation has changed quite a bit since then.” The Village’s old bylaw had only two municipal officers: the CAO and finance officer (Dunlop holds both positions). The revised bylaw not only creates the position of corporate officer, but it also allows the CAO to appoint an election officer, finance officer, chief of administration, and approving officer for subdivisions and planning."

He ascended to the Russian throne at the age of three and eventually became the first czar. Ivan laid the foundations for the Russian empire but in 1560 embarked on a rampage of murder and destruction, even murdering his son and only heir. In 1560, Protestantism was formally adopted at the First General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament had earlier voted to accept a Calvinist confession of faith, declaring that the Roman Catholic pope no longer had jurisdiction over Scotland. In 1760, Fort Levis near Prescott, Ont., above the St. Lawrence rapids, was taken by British Gen. Jeffrey Amherst in France's last stand in North America. In 1818, the Bank of Canada commenced operations in Montreal. In 1819, Scottish engineer and inventor James Watt died. Watt, who coined the term ""horsepower"" and is considered by some to be the father of the industrial revolution, devised the first efficient steam engine and was the first to use such an engine to turn a wheel. In 1825, Uruguay proclaimed its independence from Brazil. In 1860, the Prince of Wales drove the last rivet of the Victoria Bridge in Montreal. In 1867, Michael Faraday, the English scientist who discovered electromagnetic induction, died. In 1875, Capt. Matthew Webb became the first person to swim the 34-km English Channel without a life-jacket. In 1878, the ""Saskatchewan Herald,"" the province's first newspaper, put out its first issue in Battleford. Because the paper predated any railway in Saskatchewan, then the Northwest Territories, founder Patrick Gammie Laurie transported his first printing press by ox cart on a 72-day trek from Fort Garry. In 1900, German philosopher and poet Friedrich Nietzsche died after prolonged insanity. In 1906, King Edward VII granted Saskatchewan its coat of arms. In 1919, the first international air service began with Air Transport and Travel's flight from London to Paris. Only one passenger made the trip on a converted biplane bomber. The trip took two-and-a-half hours and cost 21 pounds. In 1934, Prime Minister R. B. Bennett unveiled the St. Malo Cross at Gaspe, Que., to mark explorer Jacques Cartier's first landing. In 1937, Toronto announced school openings would be delayed because of a polio epidemic sweeping southern Ontario. In 1939, Britain and Poland signed a treaty of mutual support, days after the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was announced. The Second World War broke out Sept. 1st when Germany invaded Poland. In 1939, the film ""The Wizard of Oz,"" opened across the U.S. In 1940, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were incorporated into the Soviet Union. On the same day, British planes dropped their first bombs on Berlin during the Second World War. In 1942, the Duke of Kent was killed in a plane crash in Scotland. In 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first U.S. president to visit Ottawa. Roosevelt and prime ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King of Canada and Winston Churchill of Britain had earlier attended the Quebec Conference in Quebec City. In 1944, Allied forces liberated Paris, ending four years of German occupation during the Second World War. The German commander, Maj. Gen. Dietrich von Choltitz, had defied Adolf Hitler's order to level the French capital rather than give it up. The surrender set off wild celebrations in the streets. In 1953, Dmitri Stepanovich Chuvakhin was named Soviet ambassador to Canada. It was the first time the post had been filled since 1945 when Igor Gouzenko, a Soviet Embassy cipher clerk, disclosed a Russian spy ring in Canada. In 1981, the McDonald Commission on RCMP wrongdoing issued its final report. Its recommendations included setting up a new spy agency separate from the Mounties. The Trudeau government responded by establishing CSIS, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. In 1984, author Truman Capote was found dead in a Los Angeles mansion. He was 59. An autopsy revealed he overdosed on valium, codeine and barbiturates. In 1984, Tory leader Brian Mulroney slammed Liberal Prime Minister John Turner in a televised election debate. Mulroney charged Turner had a choice when presented with a list of patronage appointments from former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. The Conservatives went on to a landslide election victory. In 1986, wheelchair athlete Rick Hansen began the cross-Canada portion of his round-the-world journey. Only $172,000 had been donated for spinal cord research when he reached Canada's most eastern point, Cape Spear, Nfld. But an outpouring of support from Canadians allowed him to reach his goal of $10 million by the time he returned home to Williams Lake, B.C., on April 2, 1987. Hansen, a world-class competitor in wheelchair sports, was inspired by his friend Terry Fox, an amputee whose run across Canada for cancer research was stopped after he developed cancer again. Hansen left Vancouver on March 21, 1985. He travelled through 34 countries, including the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union and Australia. His journey lasted 792 days, 467 of which were spent on the road. In 1987, the Canadian Medical Association approved an amendment to their code of ethics on patient confidentiality, allowing for the ""discreet disclosure"" of blood test results of people infected with the AIDS virus. In 1989, the ""Voyager 2"" spacecraft flew past the planet Neptune and its moon, Triton. It sent back photos of swampy areas, frozen lakes and craters. In 1990, Morley Callaghan, the renowned Canadian author and broadcaster, died in Toronto at age 87. He wrote more than 20 novels and about 100 short stories. He won the Governor General’s award in 1952 for his novel ""The Loved and The Lost."" Callaghan, who had been nominated for a Nobel Prize in literature, often believed he was taken for granted in Canada despite his fame outside the country. In 1991, the Soviet republic of Belarus declared full independence after the collapse of the attempt by Communist hardliners to overthrow President Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1999, Dan Miller was sworn in as premier of British Columbia. He was appointed interim leader of the NDP on Aug. 22nd, after Glen Clark resigned as premier. In 2003, Prime Minister Jean Chretien signed a historic northern land claim and self-government deal with the Dogrib or Tlicho First Nation in the Northwest Territories. The deal ceded control of 39,000 square kilometres of lake, river and tundra between the Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes, an area larger than Belgium. The area is also home to both of Canada’s diamond mines. In 2003, at least 51 people were killed in Mumbai, India, when bombs in two taxis exploded minutes apart in a crowded jewelry market in the financial district and in front of the tourist attraction, Gateway of India. In 2004, the Bank of Canada unveiled a new $20 bill with updated anti-counterfeiting features. (In May 2012, a new $20 polymer bill was introduced). In 2009, U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the last brother of the Kennedy political dynasty, died at his home in Hyannis Port, Mass., after battling a brain tumour. He was 77. Known as the liberal lion of the Senate, Kennedy was the third-longest serving senator in American history, serving almost 47 years. He was a steadfast champion of the working class and the poor and known as a powerful voice on health care, civil rights, war and peace. In 2011, Zetas cartel gunmen entered Casino Royale in Monterrey, Mexico, spread gasoline and set the building on fire, killing 52 people. In 2012, Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, died at age 82 following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures. He commanded the Apollo 11 spacecraft that landed on the moon July 20, 1969. His first words after setting foot on the surface are etched in history books and the memories of those who heard them in a live broadcast - ""That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."" In 2017, Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane off the coast of mainland Texas near Corpus Christi. It lingered off the coast for four days, dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm - with record flooding (1.2 metres) in parts of Houston - killing at least 65 people, destroying thousands of cars and leaving hundreds of thousands of families with flood-damaged homes. In 2018, Arizona Senator John McCain died of brain cancer one day after announcing he would not be seeking further treatment. He was 81. In more than three decades in Congress, McCain became known as a political maverick willing to stick to his convictions rather than go along with party leaders. The bitter rival of U.S. President Donald Trump famously cast the deciding no vote that stopped the Republican push to repeal Obamacare. In 2019, top-ranked Jin Young Ko won the CP Women's Open. The South Korean closed with a 64 for a 26-under-par 262 total, five shots better than Denmark's Nicole Broch Larsen. Canada's Brooke Henderson finished seven shots off the lead in a tie for third place with American Lizette Salas. Henderson, from Smiths Falls, Ont., won the tournament in 2018 in Regina. In 2019, Mitch Podolak, who co-founded the Winnipeg Folk Festival and who was also a prominent figure in the Canadian folk-music community, died at 71 after battling serious health issues for several years.

Henry Tudor succeeded Richard to become King Henry VII. In 1711, thick fog thwarted an assault by British Admiral Walker on Quebec. Eight of 15 warships were wrecked and almost 900 men drowned. In 1776, Britain landed 10,000 men on Long Island in a bid to quash the American Revolution. In 1800, Edward Pusey, English biblical scholar and Tractarian spokesman, was born. He worked to establish religious orders in Anglicanism, founding in 1845 the first Anglican sisterhood. In 1827, industrialist Ezra Butler Eddy, who became known as the matchmaker of the world, was born in Vermont. E.B. Eddy moved his small friction-match factory from Burlington, Vt., to Hull, Que., in 1851. He expanded, modernized and diversified to produce a variety of wood and paper products.

In 1851, the schooner ""America"" outraced the ""Aurora"" off the English coast to win a silver trophy that came to be known as the America's Cup. In 1864, the International Red Cross was established in Geneva. The organization for the relief of suffering owes its founding to the Swiss banker Jean Henri Dunant. Moved and upset by the suffering he had witnessed at the battle of Solferino in 1859, Dunant urged the formation of a voluntary aid society and initiated planning of the Red Cross. In 1884, the Calgary Agricultural Society, forerunner of the Calgary Stampede, was organized. Billed as ""The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth,"" the first exhibition took place in 1886 and the world-famous Stampede rodeo began in 1912, instigated by Guy Weadick, an American trick roper. In 1910, Japan annexed Korea, which remained under Japanese colonial rule until 1945. In 1914, Canada's War Measures Act received royal assent. In 1922, Irish revolutionary Michael Collins was shot to death, apparently by Irish Republican Army members who were opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty that Collins had co-signed. In 1933, the Liberals under Angus Lewis Macdonald gained power in a Nova Scotia election. In 1935, the Social Credit swept into power in Alberta, led by William Aberhart. The founder of the Prophetic Bible Institute in Calgary gained a wide audience through his weekly religious broadcasts on a province-wide radio network. He espoused the economic theories of Scottish engineer Clifford Douglas, who believed that conventional capitalism would founder because private control of credit would cut mass purchasing power. Aberhart died in office in 1943, but his party retained power in Alberta until 1971, when it lost to the Progressive Conservatives under Peter Lougheed. In 1943, the Communist Party of Canada, banned under the War Measures Act, became the Labour-Progressive Party. In 1950, the first Canada-wide railway strike involving 17 unions paralyzed rail and telegraph service. About 125,000 railroad and telegraph workers walked off their jobs, causing one of the most serious transportation crises in Canadian history. The strike ended Aug. 30, when Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent's government passed back-to-work legislation. In 1950, Althea Gibson became the first black tennis player to be accepted in competition for the U.S. national championship. In 1968, Pope Paul VI arrived in Bogota, Colombia, on the first-ever papal visit to Latin America. In 1978, a record-setting 97 misprints appeared in five-and-a-half column inches of ""The London Times"" article on Pope Paul VI. In 1979, former prime minister John Diefenbaker was buried on the University of Saskatchewan campus in Saskatoon. In 1985, 55 people died when fire broke out aboard a British Airtours charter jet on a runway at Manchester Airport in England. In 1989, Black Panthers co-founder Huey P. Newton was shot to death in Oakland, Calif. Gunman Tyrone Robinson was later sentenced to 32 years to life in prison. In 1991, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the rape shield law, which said the previous sexual conduct of a rape victim could not be used in court. In 2001, tests on a dead crow found near Windsor, Ont., confirmed the first case of a bird carrying the West Nile virus in Canada. In 2003, more than 24,000 residents of Kelowna, B.C., nearly one-third of the population, were driven from their homes by a forest fire that was started by lightning. It eventually destroyed 248 homes in outlying neighbourhoods. In 2003, a rocket exploded on its launch pad while undergoing pre-launch tests, killing 16 people, mostly civilian technicians, at the Alcantara space base in northeastern Brazil. In 2008, Ontario health officials announced an outbreak of dangerous listeriois after a positive connection was made between confirmed cases across Canada and a recall of deli meats produced at a Maple Leaf Foods plant in Toronto. The outbreak claimed 22 lives across Canada. In 2008, Usain Bolt helped Jamaica win the men's 4x100-metre relay final in 37.10 seconds for his third gold medal and third world record of the Beijing Olympics. (In 2017, the Jamaican team was stripped of the medal over a doping case involving teammate Nesta Carter.) (In 2012 at the London Olympics, Jamaica, anchored by Bolt, won the gold and set a new world record at 36.84 seconds.) In 2009, legendary Nova Scotia peace activist Muriel Duckworth, best known as one of the founding members of the national peace group Voice of Women, died in Magog, Que., at age 100. Duckworth co-founded a variety of social action groups and played crucial roles in several humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam Canada, where she served on the board of directors in the 1970s. In 2009, Cpl. Darby Morin, 25, from Big River First Nation in northern Saskatchewan, a soldier serving with the U.S. army, was killed when his vehicle rolled over while he was serving in Afghanistan. In 2011, federal NDP Leader Jack Layton died after a battle with cancer, just months after leading his party to an unprecedented 103 seats in the May 2 federal election. He was 61. His death came a month after he appeared at a news conference, looking frail and gaunt, to announce he was suffering from a new, unspecified cancer and would temporarily step down as head of the official Opposition. Layton's death touched off an extraordinary outpouring of national grief. People set up makeshift memorials at his Toronto home and constituency office and thousands filed by to pay their respects after Layton's flag-draped coffin was carried into Parliament on Aug. 24 and lay in state for two days. A state funeral was held in Toronto on Aug. 27. In 2015, 11 people were killed when a vintage jet fighter slammed onto a highway after it failed to pull out of a loop manoeuvre during the Shoreham Airshow in southern England, plowing through cars on the road and exploding in a huge fireball. In 2018, Ohio State suspended superstar football coach Urban Meyer for three games for mishandling repeated professional and behavioural problems of an assistant coach. Investigators found Meyer protected his protege for years through domestic violence allegations, a drug problem and poor job performance before the coach was fired the previous month. In 2020, the global death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 800,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Telegraph service; West Nile virus; Prime ministers; Rape"
"2021-08-15","Full text: Senior City of Brampton staffers and Mayor Patrick Brown have claimed a third-party investigation into allegations of widespread fraud and corruption would be handled transparently. That has not been the case. With City Hall’s highest ranking employee, CAO David Barrick, and Brown at the centre of disturbing accusations now being investigated by Deloitte, it’s no surprise to many that the probe has been shrouded in secrecy since the bombshell allegations were levelled publicly by a senior staffer. Gurdeep (Nikki) Kaur emailed her blistering accusations to hundreds of City staff, members of council, and media outlets during the early hours of April 22, resulting in a Council decision to hire Deloitte for the ongoing investigation. “I think it's important that we have the highest level of transparency on how we respond to complaints and have them investigated for their veracity,” Brown claimed at the June 2 City Council meeting. However, Brown and his supporters, Councillors Rowena Santos, Paul Vicente, Michael Palleschi, Harkirat Singh and Pat Fortini, have consistently tried to shut Brampton taxpayers out of the process. The other members of council have made clear through public comments that because those six Council members have the majority of the votes on an eleven-member legislative body, they have created a cloud of secrecy to control the investigation and lock the public out. Before Councillors Martin Medeiros, Jeff Bowman and Gurpreet Dhillon, with the support of colleagues Charmaine Williams and Doug Whillans, were finally able to force some transparency, almost all debate and decision making around the corruption investigation were handled behind closed doors during in camera meetings where the public is prevented from getting any information. The investigation lacked transparency since the very beginning, when Brown claimed it would be handled openly. Basic information, including the decision led by him and his five supporters to handicap the probe by setting an unreasonable investigation deadline of 30 days, was kept from the public. Dhillon, Bowman and Medeiros led an effort to pull the investigation out into the open, calling out their colleagues in public session and demanding matters related to the timing, scope and outcome of the probe be handled in front of Brampton taxpayers. A successful motion now ensures this. But it remains unclear if Brown and the others, aided by senior staff under the authority of Barrick, are still forcing much of the discussion around the investigation behind closed doors, away from the public. Some opponents on council publicly stated the others had forced the 30-day limit and Dhillon said he wanted previous in-camera minutes and votes to be brought out into the open so Brampton residents can see which council members have been fighting for the truth and who has been trying to protect those singled out in the damning allegations. Yesterday, at the August 11 Council meeting, members were asked by Deloitte for a second extension to properly carry out a fulsome investigation. After the investigators made clear the original 30-day limit forced by certain council members would not be nearly enough time, they were ignored, but other council members pushed the issue and got an initial extension of almost eight weeks. August 18 would have been the last day of the investigation, but it’s clear, given the seriousness and scope of the allegations, more time was needed. The second extension now makes the final day September 15. The probe into Kaur’s accusations and her evidence began June 2. All current and former City staff are allowed to bring forward their own evidence of fraud and any other possible corruption, with Deloitte obligated to gather all evidence, and conduct all the required interviews to get to the bottom of the allegations. The Pointer has been told by numerous sources that a large number of current and former staff have come forward since Kaur revealed her allegations publicly, but no confirmation of an exact number has been provided. Council members were shocked in the spring when it was revealed Barrick had closed off 28 internal fraud complaints filed by staff, without ever informing Council. More than 50 fraud complaints into the internal hotline were filed from around the time when Barrick was hired late in 2019. About 70 percent of all fraud complaints by Brampton City Hall staff filed since the hotline was established in 2016 were in a roughly one-year-period after Barrick was hired. During the same period, the disgraced former Niagara politician with zero experience running a City department, tried to secretly take over control of the internal audit department, which oversees the internal fraud hotline. The oversight department is required to report directly to Council and after Barrick tried to quietly subvert its independence, elected officials had to step in and return the reporting structure to Council, as it was prior to Barrick’s secretive effort to subvert the independent role. The current investigation is allowed to probe a wide range of conduct since Barrick was recruited by Brown in 2019. The mayor orchestrated an unusual hiring process that led to the controversial former Niagara councillor arriving in Brampton to fill the City’s top bureaucratic role. It remains unclear how exactly Deloitte was hired, a process that should have involved open debate, but was instead done in secret. It was stated that City Clerk Peter Fay was given the authority, but with Barrick in charge of all employees this raised concern about why Council members did not control the process. When Council voted to launch an investigation in a special meeting after Kaur made her allegations, the motion suggested the complaint would be investigated in its entirety. With about a dozen separate complaints, each with its own complex set of intertwined dynamics, it was always unlikely a proper investigation could be completed within a 30-day period, a complaint some councillors, and the investigator, were vocal about. “Deloitte has stated since [the] start that 30 days is not enough time for investigation based on [the] number and variety of allegations,” minutes from the closed session, in camera portion of the June 2 Council meeting, state. They were only brought out in public after the group of councillors pushing for transparency forced their successful motion. Many of Kaur’s allegations are tied to other complaints staff members have shared over the past year. One wide-ranging set of complaints made to the Ontario Ombudsman in December and shared with media outlets, including The Pointer, highlighted some of Kaur’s allegations months before she made them. That email from former senior staff members states Barrick and his subordinates violated contract rules and signed a sole-source agreement when hiring a consultant to create a business plan for a Municipal Development Corporation (MDC) that would manage the City’s real estate assets, worth tens of millions of dollars. The project was originally handled by the former commissioner of community services, Al Meneses, before Barrick took it over and handed the file to Kaur, according to the email. Meneses was later fired. Kaur alleged Barrick instructed her to only email one consultant, Menes Company (MenesCo), run by Brett Bell, a long-time Progressive Conservative Party associate of Brown, who has a two-decade relationship with the former leader of the Ontario PC party, who now sits in the mayor’s chair. Kaur told The Pointer in April MenesCo was the only firm she was told to reach out to. A set of text messages Barrick sent Kaur on January 7 was shared with The Pointer. They show Barrick sent the name, email address, and contact instructions to Kaur. “Contact: Brett Bell,” one of the texts read. Bell was approached by the City on January 9, but did not even have a registered company at the time. MenesCo was incorporated January 11, 2020, two days after he was tapped for a contract worth around $300,000."

Cabinet ministers yesterday ordered the naval officer to remain on leave rather than return as commander of the Canadian Armed Forces. It's a surprise move only days before an expected election call. McDonald's lawyers released a defiant statement Wednesday saying their client planned to return as chief of the defence staff. The assertion followed the end of a military police investigation into an allegation of misconduct that resulted in a decision last week not to lay any charges. But Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan responded to McDonald's lawyers a few hours later saying he expected the admiral to remain on leave until the government could decide what to do with him.

"2021-08-15","Full text: Notice of the Manitoba premier’s early exit mid-mandate has renewed calls to scrap his government’s overhaul of public schooling — a controversial plan that has sparked protest in all corners of the province since it was unveiled. Following Premier Brian Pallister’s Tuesday announcement he would be stepping down as leader of the Progressive Conservative party, speculation began about whether a new boss will usher in Bill 64 (Education Modernization Act) as the Tories grapple with polling numbers. The second reading of Bill 64, which aims to replace Manitoba’s English-language school boards with a centralized authority composed of government appointees, is expected in October. More than 500 presenters are signed up to speak to the bill at the subsequent committee stage, a record in Manitoba legislative assembly history. Meantime, there are numerous anti-reform campaigns and thousands of lawn signs in opposition to the sweeping changes across the province. When pressed about the status and future of Bill 64, a government spokesperson said they did not have a comment on the matter Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, the official Opposition held a news conference to call on PC MLAs to “kill the (five) bills” — Bill 16, 35, 40, 57 and 64 — the NDP stalled during the spring session. “Now that we have a lame-duck premier, it doesn’t make any sense for Manitoba to continue to pursue his legislative agenda,” said Wab Kinew, leader of the NDP, who was flanked by colleagues during a midday media availability on the legislature grounds. NDP house leader Nahanni Fontaine suggested three options for the governing party to withdraw its bills. The PC caucus could: prorogue the house so remaining bills die; vote down the legislation when second readings occur; or, seek a unanimous leave of the house to withdraw the documents."

"2021-09-22","Full text: Singh stresses affordability in pre-campaign pitch OTTAWA - New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh unfurled a blueprint for the NDP campaign platform Thursday, doubling down on affordability and economic populism as federal opposition leaders criss-cross the country ahead of an election race expected to kick off Sunday. Titled ""Ready for Better,"" the 115-page document takes aim at high earners and big business while stressing social welfare in an echo of the NDP platform from two years ago. “Tax the ultrarich to invest in people. That’s our plan. And really no other party is willing to say those words,"" Singh told reporters in St. John's. ""The burden shouldn’t fall on you and your families. It shouldn’t fall on small businesses that have already struggled so much."" Universal pharmacare, a $20 minimum wage and student debt cancellation comprise part of the proto-platform, which Singh calls""commitments for a New Deal for people"" in a not-so-subtle nod to the state-led progressivism of former U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt. Canadians without private insurance would be able to access dental and mental health care programs, he said. Singh also pledged a one per cent tax on households with fortunes topping $10 million and a temporary 15 per cent tax on large companies that enjoyed windfall profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the resulting revenue could fund the pricey promises, and that the party will work with the parliamentary budget officer to cost out portions of a more detailed platform. Thursday's action plan includes no accounting of projected costs or revenues. ""In all cases, we will manage debt and deficits responsibly, borrowing when required to rebuild and defend the services that Canadians and their families rely on, and moving to balance when it is prudent to do so,"" it states. The document, with its emphasis on expanded health coverage and wealth-and-profit taxes, marks an updated version of New Democrats' platform in the 2019 campaign, when they lost 15 seats to leave them in fourth place in the House of Commons. But Singh expressed faith Canadians would find the smorgasbord of policies appetizing. “Sometimes you look at items on that menu and you say, 'You know what, maybe I should have bought that thing last time.' And that's what we're hoping people realize,"" he said, stating that health-care and affordability issues have only become more urgent in the light of COVID-19. He also highlighted NDP efforts to boost the wage subsidy and extend emergency benefits as New Democrats strive to distinguish themselves from a Liberal party that has also pledged affordable drug coverage and signed child-care funding deals — an NDP promise too — with eight premiers since the April budget. Singh isn't the only opposition leader aiming to jump the gun on the federal horse race. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole is also off and running, making whistle stops in at least seven provinces in the past four weeks. On Wednesday in Waterloo, Ont., he laid out his plan to spur innovation by cutting the income tax rate in half on new patented technologies developed in Canada. ""Canada has all the great advantages that should make it the best place on earth to launch an innovative product and grow an innovative business,"" he said. ""But far too often, Canada loses our best and brightest to places with fewer barriers and more opportunity."" On top of the slashed patent tax, O'Toole committed to fan investment in tech startups by establishing ""flow-through shares,"" which allow the buyer to claim a tax deduction equal to the amount paid; to fix the ""administrative nightmare"" of Ottawa's Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax incentive program; and to establish the Canadian Advanced Research Agency to fund cutting edge technologies such as electric vehicles and carbon capture and storage. The announcement followed a pledge Monday to connect every Canadian with high-speed internet by 2025, part of a broader plan to help rural residents. Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet has dropped in on about 30 ridings over the past month as he looks to capitalize on wavering Tory support. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also been jetting across Canada in recent weeks as he and his cabinet sign child-care funding deals with more than half the country's premiers and make a flurry of funding announcements. Trudeau intends to visit Gov. Gen. Mary Simon on Sunday with a request to dissolve Parliament, triggering an election that would take place Sept. 20, according to a senior Liberal party source who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Singh called the decision ""selfish"" but said New Democrats are ready for the race, including its policy component. Within its first mandate, an NDP government would implement a guaranteed livable income for seniors and Canadians with disabilities as well as universal pharmacare and dental and mental health care, New Democrat officials said at a morning briefing. Pocketbook pledges range from more affordable housing to a price cap on cellphone and internet bills and 30-year terms on mortgages insured by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. An income tax hike of two points to 35 per cent for the highest bracket — now$216,511 and above — and a three-point hike on the current 15 per cent corporate tax rate are also planned. Other promises include 10 days' paid sick leave for federally regulated workers, rapid reductions to greenhouse gas emissions and implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 calls to action.

"2021-09-22","Full text: The Canadian government is investing $340 million to support Indigenous guardians and Indigenous Protected Areas as part of its commitment to conserving 30 per cent of the country’s lands and waters by 2030. The funding will be provided over the next five years and includes money earmarked to support the forming of a national Indigenous guardians network. “It is heartening to see the recognition of the role of Indigenous conservation and stewardship in achieving Canada’s ambitions in terms of its biodiversity goals and certainly in terms of keeping carbon where it is, which is in the ground,” Valérie Courtois, director of the Indigenous Leadership Initiative, told The Narwhal in an interview. The announcement comes days before the Liberals are expected to call a federal election and on the heels of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, an alarming indictment of humanity’s continuing role in wreaking havoc on the global ecosystem and an urgent warning that we collectively do everything possible to mitigate and slow down the irreversible and catastrophic effects of climate change. One of the most effective ways of doing this is through nature-based climate solutions, including Indigenous Protected Areas, which effectively create huge carbon sinks when they are established. As an example, Courtois noted the proposed Kaska Indigenous Protected Area in northern B.C. sequesters around 4.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Another proposal by the Délı̨nę community in the Northwest Territories would protect the Great Bear Lake watershed and over 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon, or around 20 years of Canada’s current annual greenhouse gas emissions. “And that’s just one proposal,” Courtois said. “The reality is that the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change that we’re facing as a globe is one that’s going to require bold changes. That’s part of what excites me about [Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas] and guardians is that they can form an anchor or basis for a conservation-based economy.” “Climate change is affecting the Yukon and the North at nearly three times the rate of the rest of the country,” Aagé Kluane Adamek, regional chief with the Assembly of First Nations, said in a statement. “Despite this, Yukon First Nations have managed to show leadership, innovative thinking and an inherent respect for Mother Nature. Fundamental to this work are the perspectives of youth, women and knowledge keepers. This investment will support these key voices and ensure we are protecting our natural world in a good way.” While Indigenous leaders welcome the investment, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the need and desire from Indigenous communities across the country. When Canada invested $25 million in a pilot project five years ago, there were 125 applications for just 10 opportunities, according to Courtois. “Our vision is really that every Indigenous nation in Canada that wants a guardian program should be able to have one and be supported in that because of the incredible return on investments of those programs and the impacts that they can have for everybody.” Those impacts include economic benefits. An analysis of two programs in the Northwest Territories showed guardian programs create around $2.50 of social, cultural and environmental benefits for every dollar invested and Coastal First Nations showed a 10:1 return on investment in guardian programs. “The work being done by Coastal First Nations … in British Columbia is a great example of how guardians being present has enabled the ability of the nations to really explore what a conservation-based economy looks like,” Courtois said, noting the nations recently signed a Fisheries Resources Reconciliation Agreement, which paves the way for Indigenous communities to create jobs and economic opportunities in the fishing sector. Indigenous guardians, often described as the eyes and ears on the land, have continually proven their value not only to their communities and to conservation efforts, but also to industrial operations. “We’ve had requests from industry representatives who were saying ‘We really like guardians, they help us on our projects — how can we contribute?’ ” Courtois said. She added Innu guardians at the world’s largest nickel mine in Voisey’s Bay, Labrador, discovered a spill polluting a fish-bearing stream that would have otherwise gone unchecked. The discovery simultaneously protected the environment and saved the mining company millions of dollars in fines. “That one incident has almost paid for the cost of the life of the program,” Courtois said. Government investment is sorely needed as many Indigenous communities face disproportionate impacts from resource development, she added. “We’re busy trying to analyze thousands of [mining] exploration permits, let alone hydro, forestry and all the other fisheries and wildlife and everything else that comes to the office,” she said of her own community. “That’s what’s great about the guardians — there are so many great examples of guardians working with scientists, with researchers, with managers and amazing revelations come out of those efforts.” A recent United Nations policy briefing noted Indigenous Peoples are stewards of a vast majority of the world’s biodiversity. “Although they account for only around 5 per cent of the world’s population, [Indigenous Peoples] effectively manage an estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the Earth’s land surface,” the report said. “This land coincides with areas that hold 80 per cent of the planet’s biodiversity and about 40 per cent of all terrestrial protected areas and ecologically intact landscapes.” At a national guardians gathering in June, Minister Wilkinson stressed the importance of looking to Indigenous Peoples for leadership. “It is abundantly clear that we have much to learn from Indigenous Peoples when it comes to conservation,” he said. “I think this is particularly evident when we see the environmental challenges that we are facing in the world today: rapid climate change, significant and accelerating biodiversity loss and the cumulative impacts of pollution in our natural environment.”"

Bray says he's willing to explore all of the recommendations because they were made in an earnest effort to improve similar situations in the future.

"2021-09-22","Full text: UPDATED to include comment from Minister Jonathan Wilkinson. The Canadian government is investing $340 million to support Indigenous guardians and Indigenous Protected Areas as part of its commitment to conserving 30 per cent of the country’s lands and waters by 2030. The funding will be provided over the next five years and includes money earmarked to support the forming of a national Indigenous guardians network. “It is heartening to see the recognition of the role of Indigenous conservation and stewardship in achieving Canada’s ambitions in terms of its biodiversity goals and certainly in terms of keeping carbon where it is, which is in the ground,” Valérie Courtois, director of the Indigenous Leadership Initiative, told The Narwhal in an interview. The announcement comes days before the Liberals are expected to call a federal election and on the heels of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, an alarming indictment of humanity’s continuing role in wreaking havoc on the global ecosystem and an urgent warning that we collectively do everything possible to mitigate and slow down the irreversible and catastrophic effects of climate change. One of the most effective ways of doing this is through nature-based climate solutions, including Indigenous Protected Areas, which effectively create huge carbon sinks when they are established. As an example, Courtois noted the proposed Kaska Indigenous Protected Area in northern B.C. sequesters around 4.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Another proposal by the Délı̨nę community in the Northwest Territories would protect the Great Bear Lake watershed and over 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon, or around 20 years of Canada’s current annual greenhouse gas emissions. “And that’s just one proposal,” Courtois said. “The reality is that the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change that we’re facing as a globe is one that’s going to require bold changes. That’s part of what excites me about [Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas] and guardians is that they can form an anchor or basis for a conservation-based economy.” Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change, told The Narwhal in an emailed statement he was in Moose Factory, Ontario with the Mushkegowuk Council signing an agreement to establish a marine conservation area when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report came out. “The communities in the James Bay area are really on the front lines of climate change. They describe shorter winters, more flooding, changes in animal migration and behaviour. These changes are recognized through their traditional knowledge and experience,” he said. “The Council is demonstrating great leadership in protecting the area, which will benefit species such as polar bear and beluga. The region is also home to what is believed to be one of the largest stores of carbon in the world.” “Climate change is affecting the Yukon and the North at nearly three times the rate of the rest of the country,” Aagé Kluane Adamek, regional chief with the Assembly of First Nations, said in a statement. “Despite this, Yukon First Nations have managed to show leadership, innovative thinking and an inherent respect for Mother Nature. Fundamental to this work are the perspectives of youth, women and knowledge keepers. This investment will support these key voices and ensure we are protecting our natural world in a good way.” While Indigenous leaders welcome the investment, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the need and desire from Indigenous communities across the country. When Canada invested $25 million in a pilot project five years ago, there were 125 applications for just 10 opportunities, according to Courtois. “Our vision is really that every Indigenous nation in Canada that wants a guardian program should be able to have one and be supported in that because of the incredible return on investments of those programs and the impacts that they can have for everybody.” Those impacts include economic benefits. An analysis of two programs in the Northwest Territories showed guardian programs create around $2.50 of social, cultural and environmental benefits for every dollar invested and Coastal First Nations showed a 10:1 return on investment in guardian programs. “The work being done by Coastal First Nations … in British Columbia is a great example of how guardians being present has enabled the ability of the nations to really explore what a conservation-based economy looks like,” Courtois said, noting the nations recently signed a Fisheries Resources Reconciliation Agreement, which paves the way for Indigenous communities to create jobs and economic opportunities in the fishing sector. Indigenous guardians, often described as the eyes and ears on the land, have continually proven their value not only to their communities and to conservation efforts, but also to industrial operations. “We’ve had requests from industry representatives who were saying ‘We really like guardians, they help us on our projects — how can we contribute?’ ” Courtois said. She added Innu guardians at the world’s largest nickel mine in Voisey’s Bay, Labrador, discovered a spill polluting a fish-bearing stream that would have otherwise gone unchecked. The discovery simultaneously protected the environment and saved the mining company millions of dollars in fines. “That one incident has almost paid for the cost of the life of the program,” Courtois said. Government investment is sorely needed as many Indigenous communities face disproportionate impacts from resource development, she added. “We’re busy trying to analyze thousands of [mining] exploration permits, let alone hydro, forestry and all the other fisheries and wildlife and everything else that comes to the office,” she said of her own community. “That’s what’s great about the guardians — there are so many great examples of guardians working with scientists, with researchers, with managers and amazing revelations come out of those efforts.” A recent United Nations policy briefing noted Indigenous Peoples are stewards of a vast majority of the world’s biodiversity. “Although they account for only around 5 per cent of the world’s population, [Indigenous Peoples] effectively manage an estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the Earth’s land surface,” the report said. “This land coincides with areas that hold 80 per cent of the planet’s biodiversity and about 40 per cent of all terrestrial protected areas and ecologically intact landscapes.” At a national guardians gathering in June, Minister Wilkinson stressed the importance of looking to Indigenous Peoples for leadership. “It is abundantly clear that we have much to learn from Indigenous Peoples when it comes to conservation,” he said. “I think this is particularly evident when we see the environmental challenges that we are facing in the world today: rapid climate change, significant and accelerating biodiversity loss and the cumulative impacts of pollution in our natural environment.”"
"2021-09-22","Full text: Cabinet orders admiral to stay on leave OTTAWA - The battle between the federal Liberal government and Admiral Art McDonald heated up on Thursday as cabinet ministers ordered the naval officer to remain on leave rather than return as commander of the Canadian Armed Forces. The surprise move only days before an expected election call represented the latest twist in a drama that had already taken several turns since McDonald’s lawyers released a defiant statement Wednesday saying their client planned to return as chief of the defence staff. The assertion followed the end of a military police investigation into an allegation of misconduct that resulted in a decision last week not to lay any charges, which McDonald’s team said exonerated the admiral and paved the way for his return. But Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan responded to McDonald’s lawyers a few hours later saying he expected the admiral to remain on leave until the government could decide what to do with him. McDonald voluntarily stepped down as defence chief on Feb. 24 because of the military police investigation, with Lt.-Gen. Wayne Eyre taking over as acting chief of the defence staff. On Thursday, Sajjan announced that McDonald was being put on administrative leave until further notice. A senior government official speaking on background said the announcement followed an order-in-council from cabinet. “Appointments like that of chief of defence staff must meet the highest possible standards and our goal must be to create a better workplace for the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces,” Sajjan added in a statement. “A workplace that ensures that complainants and survivors are treated with the utmost respect and that allegations are taken seriously in every instance.” Sajjan indicated Eyre will continue to serve as acting defence chief. McDonald's lawyer Rory Fowler declined to comment on Thursday. The nature of the allegation against McDonald has not been publicly confirmed, but CBC has reported that it related to an allegation of sexual misconduct dating back to his time commanding a Canadian warship in 2010. Global News has reported that navy Lt. Heather Macdonald, a navy combat systems engineer, came forward with the allegation against McDonald. Macdonald was quoted by Global on Friday as saying she was upset by the military police decision. The Liberal government has faced calls not to reinstate McDonald, with some experts and victims' advocates questioning the decision to have military police, rather than civilian authorities, lead the investigation. These experts and advocates have suggested this casts doubt on the veracity of the investigation, and that McDonald does not now have the moral authority to lead the military in changing its culture. They also note chiefs of the defence staff are appointed by — and serve at — the pleasure of the government in power. McDonald's legal team said the former Royal Canadian Navy commander, who took over as defence chief only five weeks before stepping down and has not previously commented publicly on the case, maintains his complete innocence. They added that McDonald passed a polygraph test that asked about past incidents of misconduct before taking over as defence chief in January and co-operated fully during the investigation. The lawyers also cited the need to respect due process in Canada. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 12, 2021.

"2021-09-22","Full text: With the appointment of Mary Simon as the first governor general of Inuit or Indigenous heritage, the executive director of the Niagara Regional Native Centre says he is happy his children have someone to look up to – but worries the position is untenable for an Indigenous person. “As a father of children, I think it’s important for them to see Indigenous people in leadership perspectives,” Karl Dockstader said in an interview. He pointed out that while Simon will be a role model to Indigenous youth of today, she had no such role model when she was a kid. “She would never have seen an Indigenous person in this high-profile leadership role,” he said. “In fact, in the community where she grew up, she wasn’t even allowed to learn French.” Simon’s lack of French has been a controversial subject since her appointment. She was educated in a federal day school in northern Quebec where French was not part of the curriculum. The new governor general is still bilingual, fluent in English and Inuktitut. The 73-year-old has promised to start learning French. The governor general is the de facto head of the Canadian military, a responsibility that Dockstader said poses potential conflict. “I would refuse a role like that. Because, as the head of the military, what if the military were called in to do something about the Coastal GasLink pipeline and the Wet’suwet’en people standing in the way,” he said. “Is an Indigenous governor general going to be put in a position where she’s going to have to authorize the use of the Canadian military against her fellow Indigenous people?” Regardless of the potential for conflict, Dockstader is happy to see Indigenous Peoples gain high-profile positions outside of Indigenous culture. “I’m never going to be a NASCAR driver but when Indigenous people do well in stock car racing, I love it,” he said. “Similarly, while I believe that our body politic exists outside of the body politic of Canada. I respect the work that Mary Simon has done.” With the national narrative surrounding the discovery of unmarked children’s graves at residential schools across the country, the possibility of tokenism on behalf of the Trudeau government cannot be overlooked. “Mary Simon has put in the work, so I want to be careful about just saying that she’s been tokenized. But it’s impossible to ignore the fact that it seems like we are very much on the doorstep of an election,” said Dockstader. He expressed concern that the Trudeau government was trying to garner favour with the appointment. “And I hate to say it because Mary Simon is very qualified. But if so, why wasn’t Mary Simon governor general before Julie Payette?” The possibility of Simon’s appointment pushing Indigenous issues forward seems even less likely in the role of governor general. “That’s where I’m the least excited. Because it’s a figurehead role, I don’t think there’s much room to resist the colonial status quo that has clearly been bad for Indigenous people,” he said. But these issues do not diminish the work that Simon has done on behalf of Inuit people in Nunavut, he said. “She helped negotiate the independence of Nunavut.” Just as Dockstader referred to the separate and distinct natures of Indigenous and Canadian political systems, there are people who are critical of Nunavut’s independence since it is still under the umbrella of Canadian Confederation, he said. Dockstader emphasized that independence was the desire of Inuit people and noted the positivity that they had a hand in deciding their future. “(Nunavut is) very politically unique and it was a solution for Inuk people by Inuk people,” he said. Simon was on the committee of the Nunavut Implementation Commission and helped establish the territory's independence in 1999. She was also the first Inuk to hold an ambassadorial position with the Canadian government, serving as the ambassador of circumpolar affairs and later as ambassador to Denmark.

"2021-08-14","Full text: At their August 4 council meeting, the South Algonquin Township council dealt with the departure of Councillor Joe Vermaire and how they intend to fill his vacant seat in Dickens ward. After discussing it at the meeting, they voted to declare Vermaire’s seat vacant. Councillor Bongo Bongo voted to hold a byelection to choose a successor, while the rest of the council voted to solicit applications to appoint someone to the role versus having a byelection to choose a successor, which would cost the township a lot of money and staff hours to execute. In a letter dated July 27 to Bryan Martin, the CAO/clerk-treasurer, Vermaire said that he regretfully resigned his position effective immediately due to other commitments and changes in personal matters. He said he felt it was best to make way for someone else with the time and energy to devote fully to the position. He said he was proud to have been part of council and all that they accomplished, and proud to represent his constituents. He wished council and staff all the best going forward to meet whatever challenges awaited them. Mayor Jane Dumas and council were made aware of Vermaire’s resignation on July 29. At the Aug. 4 meeting, under Action items, Dumas brought up the subject of Vermaire’s resignation and thanked him for his service to South Algonquin Township. She then turned the floor over to Martin, who said that he’d prepared some alternatives for council to discuss on how to fill the vacant council seat. He recommended that council fill it by getting in applications and appointing someone to the position, as there are only 16 months until the next general election. The other alternative is to have a byelection, which would cost at least $5,000 and many staff hours to execute. He said that with either option, council has to follow through on it within 60 days. “The cost of doing so and the effort that becomes involved in this undertaking, in my experience in council’s past, they have simply appointed an individual. That said, if council so deems, I’m open to the options that council selects today,” he says. Councillor Joe Florent said there was a precedent in the township for appointing a replacement, as a councillor had resigned from Lyell ward in the previous term or the one before that. “We went with the applications and the appointment. I’m recommending we use the same process again, especially since there’s only 16 months left in the mandate,” he says. Most members of council were in favour of appointing Vermaire’s replacement, with the exception of Councillor Bongo Bongo, who was in favour of having a byelection. To that end, he asked Martin a few questions about having a potential byelection, having to do with whether it was Dickens ward specific in terms of who could vote for the new candidate [it is], how it would be paid for [the township’s election reserve fund] and how long it would take [approximately 90 days]. In addition to the financial savings and the savings in staff time, Mayor Jane Dumas pointed out that appointing a qualified candidate to the vacant seat would be quicker than a byelection. “So, I think for the residents of Dickens ward, they would have someone at the table a bit more quickly,” she says. Martin agreed with Dumas that appointing a candidate was much more expedient. He said he would post an advertisement soliciting the vacant council seat in the local newspapers, as well as on the township’s social media. “At that point, council can look at the applicants and decide who to appoint to this vacant seat.” Later on in the meeting, council voted to declare Vermaire’s seat vacant. Most of council voted to solicit applications from all interested and qualified parties to fill the vacancy, with the exception of Bongo, who wanted to have a byelection. Anyone interested in the vacant council seat is asked to contact Martin by email at clerk@southalgonquin.ca or by fax at 613-637-5368 by the deadline of Aug. 31 at 3 p.m. Subject: Appointments & personnel changes; Councils; Cost control"

Justice Minister David Lametti says Bill C-218 will allow Canadians to bet on individual games ""in a regulated and safe environment."" The Conservative private member's bill garnered enthusiasm from legislators in all four main parties. It passed through the House of Commons in February, was approved by the Senate on June 22 and received royal assent a week later. It's aimed at winning back customers from offshore sites, U.S. casinos and illegal bookmakers. Several provincial governments are already gearing up to take advantage of the new revenue streams. Thursday's announcement of a ""coming into force date"" came a day after the Conservative MP who introduced the bill accused the Liberals of dragging their feet on enacting the legislation. ""This is just another example of the Trudeau Liberals choosing to implement the laws they like, while delaying the ones they don't,"" Kevin Waugh said in a statement Wednesday. Waugh's bill marked the third time a would-be law with the same goal has blazed a trail through Parliament, but none have made it this far. Similar legislation zipped through the House of Commons with all-party support nearly a decade ago but foundered in the Senate and died when an election was called in 2015. A second attempt by New Democrat MP Brian Masse also failed after the then-Liberal majority voted down his private member's bill in concert with Conservatives in 2016.

Singh told reporters in St. John's the N-D-P plan is to ``Tax the ultrarich to invest in people."" He says no other party is really willing to say those words. Universal pharmacare and dental care, a $20 minimum wage and student debt cancellation comprise part of the proto-platform, which Singh labels his ``commitments for a New Deal for people'.' It's a not-so-subtle nod to the state-led progressivism of former U-S president Franklin Roosevelt. The 115-page document pledges a one per cent tax on households with fortunes topping $10 million and a temporary 15 per cent tax on large companies that enjoyed windfall profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Singh plans an income tax hike of two points to 35 per cent for the highest bracket -- currently $216,511 and above -- and a three-point hike to put the corporate tax rate at 18 per cent. Singh says the resulting revenue could fund the pricey promises, and that the party will work with the parliamentary budget officer to cost out portions of a more detailed platform. Today's action plan includes no accounting and is an updated version of New Democrats' platform in the 2019 campaign, when they lost 15 seats to leave them in fourth place in the House of Commons.

"2021-08-14","Full text: Today in History - Aug. 12 Today in History for Aug. 12: In 1615, the first mass in Ontario was celebrated by Father Le Caron in a Huron village near Thunder Bay. In 1658, the first American police force was formed with the founding of the eight-man rattle watch in New Amsterdam, now New York City. In 1676, the most devastating Indian war in the history of New England ended when King Philip, chief of the Wampanoag Indians, was killed in Rhode Island. The war, which involved several tribes and all the New England colonies, began when English settlers executed three native tribesmen for murder. In 1842, the British Parliament created the Amalgamated Assembly of Newfoundland. In 1851, American inventor Isaac Singer was granted a patent on his sewing machine. Singer, a machinist, was asked to fix a sewing machine that had come into the shop and 11 days later he had designed and built a better version. His design allowed continuous and curved stitching and had an arm that allowed sewing to be done on all parts of an item. Almost all machines since have copied the basic concept. In 1856, the legislature of Vancouver Island opened at Victoria. In 1877, Thomas Edison reportedly first successfully demonstrated his phonograph. But the date was fixed upon years later for an anniversary celebration, and subsequent research has indicated that the first working phonograph probably was not made until the fall of 1877. Edison's machine consisted of a metal cylinder and two diaphragm-and-needle units -- one for recording and one for reproduction. Tin foil was wrapped around the cylinder and the sound vibrations were etched on it as the cylinder was turned. For the first demonstration, Edison recited the nursery rhyme ""Mary Had a Little Lamb,"" and the machine played back a recognizable reproduction of his voice. In 1882, the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada merged with the Great Western Railway. The merger was the result of financial difficulties and American competition. In 1889, the boundaries of Manitoba and Ontario were defined by an imperial act. In 1898, Hawaii was formally annexed by the United States. The U.S. government had been leasing the naval base at Pearl Harbor since 1884. The island republic requested annexation and, in 1959, succeeded in its long campaign for full statehood. In 1898, the peace protocol ending the Spanish-American war was signed. In 1908, the first Model T rolled off the Ford Motor Company assembly line in Detroit. Also known as the ""Tin Lizzie,"" it was introduced for sale to the public later in the year. Eventually 15 million of the cars were manufactured, putting the United States on wheels and helping to launch a manufacturing revolution. In 1909, Fort William, now Thunder Bay, Ont., was placed under martial law as a result of riots during a strike by freight handlers. Credit for bringing the riots under control was given to Sir Samuel Benfield Steele, a legendary mounted police officer. Steele joined the militia in 1866 during the Fenian troubles and was a private in the Red River Expedition of 1870. Shortly after that, he became a sergeant major in the newly created North-West Mounted Police. In 1909, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home to the Indianapolis 500, first opened. In 1942, British Prime Minister Churchill met Soviet leader Josef Stalin in Moscow to reaffirm their Second World War alliance against the Axis powers. In 1953, the Soviet Union conducted its first hydrogen bomb test. In 1960, the first balloon satellite, the ""Echo One,"" was launched by the U.S. from Cape Canaveral. In 1961, East Germany sealed off the border between eastern and western sectors of Berlin with barbed wire and barricades. In 1964, Ian Fleming, the popular novelist and creator of ""James Bond,"" died. In 1972, the United States ended its ground combat role in Vietnam with the withdrawal of the last U.S. unit. In 1977, the first space ship designed to be reused, the American shuttle ""Enterprise,"" flew on its own for the first time in a test flight over California's Mojave Desert. In 1978, Canada won the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton with a total of 45 gold medals, 31 silver and 33 bronze. The Games were created as the British Empire Games by former Hamilton Spectator sports editor Bobby Robinson. In 1978, in Rome, the first papal funeral ever held outdoors was conducted for Pope Paul VI in St. Peter’s Basilica. In 1981, IBM introduced its first personal computer, the model 5150. In 1981, air traffic controllers in Canada resumed full operations after Ottawa agreed to set up a special fact-finding team to investigate problems involving flights to or from the United States. Two days earlier, the controllers had cut off most flights between the two countries, claiming the skies were unsafe because of a strike by U.S. controllers. Thousands of passengers were delayed throughout North America and Europe. In 1982, actor Henry Fonda died at age 77. In 1984, the Summer Olympics closed in Los Angeles as Canada celebrated its best showing ever. Canada won 10 gold, 18 silver and 16 bronze, finishing fourth. The Games were boycotted by Soviet-bloc countries. In 1985, Petro-Canada became the country's largest service station owner when it paid Gulf Canada $886 million for 1,800 stations and four refineries in Ontario and Western Canada. The move gave Petro-Canada about 4,300 service stations across Canada, compared with 3,400 for Imperial Esso. In 1985, a Japanese jumbo jet crashed into Mount Ogura, northwest of Tokyo, killing 520 people. Only four people survived the world's worst single-aircraft disaster.

In 1991, the Parti Quebecois won its first byelection ever in 20 years, ending a losing streak that included 35 byelections. It was won in the Montmorency riding near Quebec City. In 1992, after 14 months of negotiations, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico announced they had concluded the North American Free Trade Agreement. When the continental trade deal took effect in 1994, it created the world's largest trading bloc. In 1994, the baseball season ended when players went on strike to fight owners' demands for a salary cap. At 74-40, the Montreal Expos had the best record in the majors.

In 2000, the Russian submarine ""Kursk"" became trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea, above the Arctic Circle, after an accident during naval exercises. The crew of 118 died after a week of failed rescue attempts. The sub was raised from the sea floor a year later. In 2003, Canadian-built scientific satellite ""SCISAT"" was launched from Vandenberg air force base in California. Its mission was to observe the depletion of the ozone layer around the Arctic Circle and examine what factors, besides CFC's, such as climate change, were responsible for that depletion. In 2004, Andre Ouellet resigned as president of Canada Post in the wake of audit reports saying he had not properly accounted for about $2 million in expenses. In 2007, identical quadruplets were born to Karen Jepp of Calgary in a hospital in Great Falls, Mont. The odds of giving birth to identical quadruplets is 1-in-13 million. The delivery raised questions about why Canada's health care system could not handle the deliveries. In 2007, Merv Griffin, the entertainer turned impresario who parlayed his ""Jeopardy"" and ""Wheel of Fortune"" television game shows into a multimillion-dollar empire, died of prostate cancer at age 82. In 2010, the war crimes trial began for imprisoned 23-year-old Toronto native Omar Khadr in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He faced five charges, including killing U.S. Sgt. Chris Speer by throwing a hand grenade in Afghanistan in July 2002 when he was 15 years old. (Khadr's only lawyer, Lt. Col. Jon Jackson, collapsed in the courtroom and was flown back to the U.S. for treatment, forcing the trial to be put on hold. In October, Khadr changed his plea to guilty in an agreement that would see him start serving his sentence in the U.S. In September 2012, he was transferred to a Canadian prison to serve out the remaining six years of his sentence. In 2015, he was freed on bail after an Alberta Court of Appeal justice rejected a last-ditch federal government appeal to keep him behind bars while he appeals his U.S. conviction for war crimes in Afghanistan.) In 2011, Canada imposed a new round of economic sanctions on North Korea in response to the regime's involvement in the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in March 2010.

(He was later sentenced to life in prison.) In 2013, the world ATP rankings were released with Milos Raonic in the 10th spot, making him the first Canadian men's singles tennis player to crack the top-10. In 2014, the multi-party board that polices House of Commons spending concluded 23 NDP MPs improperly used their parliamentary budgets to pay the salaries of employees in satellite offices in Montreal, Quebec City and Toronto over the past three years. They were ordered to repay untold millions. In 2014, Lauren Bacall, the slinky, sultry-voiced actress who created on-screen magic with Humphrey Bogart in ""To Have and Have Not"" and ""The Big Sleep"" and off-screen magic in one of Hollywood's most storied marriages, died at age 89. In 2015, at least 121 people were killed, half of which were firefighters, and 700 injured after huge explosions at a warehouse for hazardous chemicals in the Chinese port of Tianjin sent massive fireballs into the night sky. Windows were shattered for kilometres around by the shockwaves. In 2016, Canada's Rosie MacLennan won the gold medal in women's trampoline at the Rio Games, becoming the first Canadian summer athlete to successfully defend an individual Olympic title. In 2017, a car plowed through a group of counter-protesters at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 other people. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, was arrested shortly after and charged with second-degree murder and other counts. In 2017, former NHL coach and GM Bryan Murray died after a three-year battle with colon cancer. He was 74. Murray won the Jack Adams award as coach of the year in 1984 with the Washington Capitals and executive of the year as general manager of the Florida Panthers in 1993. Later, he coached the Ottawa Senators to a Stanley Cup final appearance in 2007. He was promoted to general manager and held that position until stepping down after the 2016 season. He compiled a coaching record of 620 wins (10th most in NHL history), 465 losses, 131 ties and 23 overtime losses. In 2017, Jamaican sprint king Usain Bolt failed to make it to the finishing line in his final race, as the anchor crumpled to the track with a left hamstring injury as he was chasing gold in the 4x100-metre relay at the world championships. In 2018, NASA launched a spacecraft that was to fly closer to the sun than anything ever sent before. The Parker Solar Probe rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on an unprecedented quest that was to take it straight through the wispy edges of the corona of the sun. In 2018, Brooks Koepka shot a major championship record-tying 264 over 72 holes to win the PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club in suburban St. Louis. It was Koepka's second major victory of the year, after winning the U.S. Open in June. In 2018, Simona Halep defeated third-seeded Sloane Stephens in a see-saw battle that featured 15 service breaks to win the Rogers Cup women's singles final in Montreal. It was the second Rogers Cup title for the world's top-ranked women's player. In 2018, Rafael Nadal beat Stefanos Tsitsipas to win the Rogers Cup men's singles tennis tournament in Toronto. It was the fourth Rogers Cup title for Nadal. In 2019, the RCMP confirmed the bodies found near the remote northern Ontario community of Gillam were two British Columbia men who led police on a cross-Canada manhunt. Police said autopsies determined Bryer Schmegelsky and Kam McLeod died by what appears to be suicide by gunfire. They also say they were testing two firearms located with the dead men to ""definitively confirm"" the weapons are connected to three homicide investigations in northern B.C. In 2019, Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister visited the province's lieutenant governor to officially start the campaign for a provincial election. The campaign had unofficially been under way since Pallister had announced in June that voters would be going to the polls on Sept. 10, more than a year earlier than the province's fixed election date of Oct. 6, 2020. In 2019, the Trump administration unveiled a crackdown on legal immigration. It announced it would disqualify applicants who use government assistance and ban entry to those who can't prove their financial worth. In 2019, Gen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's chief of the defence staff, issued an order banning members of the Canadian military from getting certain tattoos, including those that could be deemed discriminatory or sexually explicit. The military's guidelines previously banned tattoos that were ""visible either in military uniform or in civilian clothing"" that could be deemed to be offensive or otherwise reflect discredit on the armed forces. The new rules apply whether a tattoo is visible or not and lay out in much more detail what images are forbidden, including those connected to criminal activities such as criminal gangs. In his directive, Vance said the aim was to maintain the military's positive reputation, ""which prioritizes the promotion of diversity, respect and inclusion."" ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Olympic games; Athletic drafts & trades; Strikes; Professional baseball; World War II; Riots; Sewing machines"

Deborah Yedlin says a vaccine passport system could serve as an additional safety measure as Alberta prepares to scale back testing, masking and isolation requirements on Monday. She says if you can't measure something, you can’t manage it. The call comes after Quebec announced a vaccine passport system that people will use to access non-essential services like gyms, restaurants, bars, festivals and event venues, but will not be required for retail stores. Yedlin says the Chamber wants to see a similar system in Alberta so businesses can stay open despite a rising number of cases in the province.

"2021-09-22","Full text: Sajjan, McDonald clash over defence chief return OTTAWA - Admiral Art McDonald is planning to return to his position as commander of the Canadian Armed Forces after military police opted not to charge him following an investigation into his conduct, though the Liberal government does not appear ready to welcome him back so soon. McDonald stepped down in February as chief of the defence staff as a result of a Canadian Forces National Investigation Service investigation into an allegation of misconduct. But in a statement released Wednesday, McDonald’s legal team said the naval officer would be returning to the position after the nearly six-month investigation “exonerated” him. “Given that it was his decision to step aside, it is now his decision — indeed obligation — to return to his duties,” reads the statement issued by lawyers Michael Edelson and Rory Fowler. “Admiral McDonald, who has long been recognized as a proven leader of culture change in the Canadian Armed Forces, will now return to his duties as chief of defence staff.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to news of McDonald’s plan to take back command of the military from acting defence chief Lt.-Gen. Wayne Eyre. But Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said he expects McDonald to wait, which could set up a battle between the Liberal government and its hand-picked military commander ahead of a possible federal election. ""My expectation is that Admiral McDonald will remain on leave while we while we review this situation,"" he said at a news conference in Vancouver Wednesday, adding he only learned about McDonald’s plan a short time earlier. ""The position of chief of defence staff must always uphold the highest standard within the Canadian Armed Forces because of the responsibility of that position and the weight that it holds.” He went on to add that Canadians and the Canadian Armed Forces are being “very well served” by Eyre at a time when the military is helping battle wildfires in British Columbia, rescue interpreters from Afghanistan and other security challenges. The Canadian Forces National Investigation Service announced the end of the probe into McDonald's conduct late Friday, saying they had decided there was not enough evidence to charge McDonald under either the Criminal Code or the military's disciplinary code. McDonald’s lawyers said in their statement that the fact military police couldn’t find enough evidence to charge him even under the disciplinary code was evidence the allegation against their client was unfounded. “The investigators, and the prosecutors who advise them, would have been conscious of the criticism that would arise if no charges were laid,” Edelson and Fowler said. “They had a compelling motivation to pursue charges, even on weak evidence, in order to avoid the very criticism that has now been levelled against them. The absence of any charges — even under the Code of Service Discipline — is indicative of the absence of blameworthy conduct. As the investigation revealed, the complaint was groundless."" The nature of the allegation against McDonald has not been publicly confirmed, but CBC has reported that it related to an allegation of sexual misconduct dating back to his time commanding a Canadian warship in 2010. Global News has reported that navy Lt. Heather Macdonald, a navy combat systems engineer, came forward with the allegation against McDonald. Macdonald was quoted by Global on Friday as saying she was upset by the military police decision. The Liberal government has faced calls not to reinstate McDonald, with some experts and victims' advocates questioning the decision to have military police, rather than civilian authorities, lead the investigation. These experts and advocates have suggested this casts doubt on the veracity of the investigation, and that McDonald does not now have the moral authority to lead the military in changing its culture. They also note chiefs of the defence staff are appointed by — and serve at — the pleasure of the government in power, suggesting the Liberals can easily replace McDonald. Provost Marshal Brig.-Gen. Simon Trudeau defended the independence and professionalism of his military police officers in a statement announcing the end of the investigation into McDonald’s conduct. McDonald’s legal team said the former Royal Canadian Navy commander, who took over as defence chief only five weeks before stepping down and has not previously commented publicly on the case, maintains his complete innocence. They added that he co-operated fully during the investigation, and cited the need to respect due process in Canada. “As has been cited during this investigation, ‘If we don’t have due process, then all we have are witch hunts … That doesn’t change the culture. It just makes it unfriendly for everyone,” the statement reads. “If there is a failure to respect ‘due process,’ it imperils the very basis of the rule of law in either military or civilian domain.” McDonald took over as chief of the defence staff from now-retired general Jonathan Vance in January, weeks before Global reported allegations of sexual misconduct by Vance, who has since been charged with obstruction of justice. On Feb. 24, McDonald voluntarily stepped aside until military police could investigate the allegation about his conduct. The two investigations as well as the emergence of allegations of inappropriate misconduct prompted a fresh reckoning for the military when it comes to sexual misconduct in the ranks. The Liberal government eventually tapped retired Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour to come up with recommendations for addressing the issue, though some criticized the choice to launch another review after several similar studies in the past. The government also came under sustained fire for its handling of the allegations against Vance, one of which was originally raised by the military ombudsman to Sajjan in March 2018. Meanwhile, Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin is currently fighting the government in court for reinstatement as head of Canada’s vaccine distribution campaign after he was abruptly replaced in May due to an allegation of sexual misconduct. Fortin, who has maintained his innocence, has alleged the decision to replace him was politically motivated and denied him due process.

"2021-08-14","Full text: Manitoba premier must be open to change: experts WINNIPEG - Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister's announcement that he isleaving the job has set in motion a leadership race, and experts say whoever takes the helm of the Progressive Conservatives will need to distance themselves from his record. ""Even with a new leader, the Tories have a pretty big hole to climb out of,"" Mary Agnes Welch with Winnipeg-based polling firm Probe Research said Wednesday. Pallister announced Tuesday he is not running in the province's next election in 2023. The premier had hinted for the last year that retirement was on his plate but the confirmation occurred following weeks of backlash over comments he made about Canadian history. He apologized last week for saying that people who came to Canada before and after it became a country did not come to destroy but to build. Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba, said he believes the party will have to pick a leader who has a softer image and is more willing to follow the province's political tradition of constructive change. ""They want that kind of leader who won't be as single-minded, determined and defensive as Pallister."" He added there are no present front-runners, but the party could be looking at Families Minister Rochelle Squires, deputy premier Kelvin Goertzen or, at the federal level, Conservative member of Parliament Candice Bergen. Thomas said the party would benefit from choosing an urban progressive candidate. Finance Minister Scott Fielding said he is ""very seriously"" considering a run for the job. Eileen Clarke, a former Indigenous relations minister, ended speculation she may also throw her hat in the ring, saying she does not intend to run. Clarke said in a statement on social media that she is relieved Pallister will be stepping away. She resigned from cabinet after Pallister's comments. ""There are many challenges before us but it's a new day and we have a new opportunity to ensure a more transparent and inclusive future for all Manitoba people,"" she said. ""I am confident in the weeks and months ahead with a renewed optimism for good governance."" Pallister hasn't said when he will step down and the party appears unaware how long he will remain. Two Progressive Conservative sources who were at this week's caucus meeting in Brandon said Pallister did not attend Wednesday. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said caucus remains in the dark as to how long Pallister will stay. The party's executive council has said it will meet in the coming days to determine leadership contest rules. Its constitution states the next leader is to be chosen by all party members on a one-member, one-vote basis. Most of the party's team has remained quiet about who could fill the role. Pallister ran unopposed for leader in 2012, after spending years in provincial and federal politics. His hard-driving approach won him few friends but helped guide the Tories to the largest majority government in a century in 2016. Backbench Tory MLA Shannon Martin said on social media that the party now needs to ""focus on communication, consensus (and) caucus."" Any new premier will also need to act fast to repair relationships with Indigenous communities, said David Chartrand, president of the Manitoba Métis Federation. Chartrand has had a long,contentious relationship with Pallister. Itworsened when the premier cancelled a $67.5-million agreement that was aimed at securing the federation's support for hydroelectric developments. ""It's going to take some real big bridge-building quickly by any new premier from the (Progressive) Conservative party,"" Chartrand said. Pallister's legacy has seen many other fights and controversial legislation, and there is currently public anger over a plan to reform the education system. The Opposition New Democrats are calling for that bill and four others to be abandoned now that Pallister has announced he is stepping aside. NDP Leader Wab Kinew said it's time to hit pause on the legislation until the premier's position is handed over. ""Mr. Pallister should take his legislative agenda with him,"" Kinew said.

Apparently, there’s no lack of them there, says St. Mary’s deputy warden James Fuller, who is on vacation as he traverses the land of the midnight sun this month. “One of the unexpected surprises are the amount of native Nova Scotians, more in particular folks from Antigonish and Cape Breton Island that have made Yukon their home,” Fuller told the Journal. “There is an open friendliness and willingness to help, guide, and offer suggestions for things to see and do that increases when you identify as being from the Maritimes. Even the premier, Sandy Silver, is an Antigonish man.” The premier’s official bio puts it this way: “Originally from Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Silver has lived in Dawson City since 1998. Prior to his election to the legislative assembly, he led the mathematics department at Robert Service School in Dawson City and coached, mentored and tutored youth. The premier holds degrees in math and psychology from Saint Francis Xavier University.”"

N-D-P Opposition Leader Wab Kinew says no one should breathe a sigh of relief, as Pallister's enablers remain in power. Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont says it is clear Pallister is stepping aside under pressure. Indigenous leaders say they welcome Pallister's departure.

Revera says the Parkview Place facility was built 60 years ago and can't be renovated to meet current standards. The company says it has notified the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority of the impending closure.

The province says it will spend 119-million dollars on direct support through the AgriRecovery program to help producers retain their breeding herds. Many pastures and crops across Saskatchewan have been severely affected by the drought and many dugouts are dry or have poor water quality. Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association president Kelcy Elford welcomed the news. The province has also asked Ottawa to contribute an additional 178-million dollars to support producers.

The city administration has outlined three options for council to consider; leave the speed limit at 50 km/h, reduce it to 40 km/h or drop it down to 30 km/h. A report recommends cutting the speed limit to 40 km/h, saying it would improve traffic safety resulting in less severe injuries and fatalities, and reduce noise. The report will be submitted at the transportation committee's next meeting and later it will be up to city council to decide how to proceed.

For several weeks, communities and rural areas across southern Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have been reporting a higher than usual number of grasshoppers inhabiting grassy areas and feasting on crops -- something that hasn't been seen since the early 2000s. Dan Johnson, an environmental professor at the University of Lethbridge, says the abnormal heat wave that many parts of Western Canada have experienced created an environment for the insects to thrive. While this year has been challenging, experts believe that if the fall brings warm temperatures and the dry, hot weather continues next summer the grasshopper problem will be even more severe.

"2021-08-13","Full text: --- (China-Canada)(Audio:001) Canadian businessman Michael Spavor has been sentenced to 11 years in prison in a spying case that has been linked to Beijing's pressure campaign against Canada's government. Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were detained soon after an executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei (WAH'-way) was arrested at the Vancouver airport in 2018 at the request of the U-S. China says her case is political and has repeatedly demanded her release, while denying a direct connection to the two Michaels' trials. Canada's ambassador to China says Spavor is resilient and in good spirits. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calls the sentence ""unacceptable and unjust,"" and vows his government will keep working to bring them home as soon as possible. (3) --- (Cda-China-Meng) The formal extradition hearing for the Huawei (WAH'-way) executive who the U-S accuses of fraud is expected to start today in B-C Supreme Court in Vancouver. Government lawyers will be making the case for why Meng Wanzhou (MUNG' wan-JOH') should be extradited to New York to face charges. Her long-awaited hearing comes as courts in China prosecute Canadians whose detentions, arrests or sentencings are widely seen as retaliation for her 2018 arrest at the Vancouver International Airport. The Chinese telecom giant's chief financial officer and daughter of its founder denies allegations that she put H-S-B-C at risk of breaking U-S sanctions against Iran.

The insurgents now control two-thirds of the nation as the U-S and NATO finalize their withdrawal after its decades-long war there.

"2021-08-13","Full text: Barry’s Bay – The late Ontario Premier Bill Davis, who led Ontario for almost a decade and a half from 1971 to 1985, is being remembered as a man who was most definitely the boss but was also able to relate well to people of all ages. Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke MPP John Yakabuski recalled the first time he met the late premier, who died on Sunday at age 92. It was before he became premier and in the years he was serving as minister of education for the province. That would have been some time between 1962 to 1971. At the time Minister Davis was visiting St. John Bosco School in Barry’s Bay for an announcement. “I remember his warmth towards young people, even children,” he said. “Years ago, children and adults did not mix as much. They were out of bounds, but he was very warm and I still remember that.” Mr. Yakabuski was accompanying his father, Paul Yakabuski who was the MPP for Renfrew South at the time. The late Mr. Yakabuski and Mr. Davis were colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party and in the Ontario government and would be so for over two decades. “Dad was a colleague of Premier Davis from 1963 to 1985,” he recalled. While Premier Davis was younger than his father, he had been in Queen’s Park longer. He was first elected to serve as the representative for Peel in 1959, a few years before the late Mr. Yakabuski was elected in the early 1960s. Speaking from his home in Barry’s Bay on Monday, John Yakabuski said he remembered Mr. Davis as a man whose strong leadership molded Ontario. “You saw two sides to him – a very plain humble man but also the man in charge; he was the boss,” he said. “Premier Davis was very much the leader of the government and the party.” The late premier was transformative for Ontario and his impact continues to be felt, he said. As minister of education, he was responsible for helping create the community college system in Ontario and that impact is still felt today, Mr. Yakabuski said. As premier he continued to support its development, he added. “He was to a large extent the architect of that system,” he said. “We look at it today and the university only system of education would not produce the people we need to churn the economy.” Today the importance of community colleges is even more visible as the trades gain focus again and the need for those skilled learning programs is apparent, he added. In the Ottawa Valley, Algonquin College has been an important driver and source of education locally as well. Mr. Yakabuski pointed out significant investments in Algonquin continue like the funding for more training in forestry and lumber programs. Premier Davis led Ontario through all of the 1970s and into the 1980s. Those were not easy years, but the premier exuded calm confidence. “He was the man with the steady hand at the wheel of the ship,” Mr. Yakabuski said. “There was no panic and always a calm confidence. Maybe he was like the duck paddling like hell below the water, but on the surface, it was all calm.” Those were tremendous years for Ontario but also tough years, he said. “He guided us through the recession of the early 80s and it was not just an Ontario recession but everywhere,” he said. Those were the days of high interest rates of 18 per cent and people were struggling, he noted. “You think today, ‘how people could survive that?’,” he said. The late Paul Yakabuski died in 1987 shortly after Premier Davis left politics a few years before. He died the day the election was called, so he was the sitting member for his riding. “The riding (Renfrew South), parliament and Paul Yakabuski all expired on the same day,” John Yakabuski said. It was a time of redistribution and the riding was amalgamated into a new one. Mr. Yakabuski recalled his father having a respect for the late premier and his colleague. Since John Yakabuski was elected in 2003, he had several opportunities to meet the late Premier Davis who remained active behind the scenes as a source of institutional knowledge and wisdom when needed. “It was always a special honour to be in his company and feel a sense of the aura and the magnitude of the man who meant so much to Ontario and Canada,” he said. “You would see him at different events. He was open with his willingness to give counsel but he was not one to meddle.” The late premier kept a close watch on what was happening in the province and country, he added. “You don’t spend 14 years leading the leading province of the country and lose interest,” Mr. Yakabuski said. Reflecting on the legacy of the late Premier Davis, the MPP said he played a significant role in Ontario and also in Canada during the constitutional crisis when he was premier. Many credit him for having an important role in a compromise that resulted in the passage of the 1982 constitution. A native of Brampton, he was known to many as “Brampton Billy” during his political career. He remains one of the country’s longest serving premiers. “He was a great man,” Mr. Yakabuski said.

"2021-08-13","Full text: --- (Mba-Pallister-Resignation) Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister says he won't seek re-election. Pallister, who is 67, made the comments today during a caucus retreat in Brandon, Man. The premier has been under fire over the past month for comments he made about Canadian history. He apologized last week after saying in July that people who came to Canada before and after it became a country did not come to destroy but to build. Since then, his Indigenous relations minister resigned from cabinet, two Indigenous men quit provincial economic development boards and Indigenous leaders have roundly condemned the premier. Some Progressive Conservative caucus members have also distanced themselves from Pallister's remarks. (The Canadian Press) --- (Sask-Belanger-Resigns) Saskatchewan's longest-serving Indigenous member of the legislature plans to jump to federal politics with an election call believed to be imminent. New Democrat Buckley Belanger is resigning his seat as of Monday to seek the federal Liberal nomination in the northern riding of Desnethé-Missinippi-Churchill River. Buckley has been an M-L-A for more than 26 years and currently represents the Athabasca constituency. He says he's making this shift in politics to bring a strong Indigenous voice to the federal level. (The Canadian Press) --- (COVID-Alta-Schools) Three year-round Catholic schools in Edmonton are bringing back mandatory masking, COVID-19 screening protocols and enhanced cleaning as students prepare to return to class tomorrow. The schools say they are reinstating the safety measure as they await updated guidelines from the Alberta government in mid-August. Edmonton Catholic School division spokeswoman Christine Meadows says that guidance will direct their back-to-school plans for students returning in September. The move comes as Alberta prepares to drop mandatory isolation for those testing positive for COVID-19 next Thursday despite leading the country in active cases. (The Canadian Press) --- (Alta-Coal-Grassy) The company behind a proposed open-pit coal mine in the Rocky Mountains is accusing the federal environmental minister of riding roughshod over its legal rights. Benga Mining says Jonathan Wilkinson decided the Grassy Mountain project can't proceed even though it and two First Nations are appealing a review board's decision that the mine is not in the public interest. Wilkinson says that while mining is important to the economy, coal can include significant adverse environmental effects. Benga says it's shocked that he ignored its request to hold off on a decision on the mine while the appeal process runs its course. (The Canadian Press) --- (Mba-Livestock-Drought) The Manitoba government has announced 62-million dollars in support for livestock producers affected by this year’s drought. It says the spending under the AgriRecovery framework will help sustain the beef herd in the province and support the longer-term sustainability of the livestock sector. Agriculture Minister Ralph Eichler says the extremely dry weather has affected the ability of producers to find suitable pasture and feed for their animals. Eichler says without additional help, they will have to consider reducing their herds or leaving the industry altogether. (The Canadian Press) --- (Alta-Triple-Fatal) Alberta R-C-M-P say three people have been killed in a collision between an S-U-V and a semi-truck in Sturgeon County. Police say an investigation found the crash occurred when the S-U-V appeared to swerve into an oncoming lane on Highway 2 north of Morinville last night. Witnesses reported the white-coloured S-U-V was being driven erratically in the Athabasca area before the crash. Police say all three people in the S-U-V died at the scene while the driver of the semi-truck wasn't hurt. (The Canadian Press) --- (Sask-Assault-Death) Prince Albert police say a 40-year-old woman has died in hospital after suffering serious injuries in an assault.

"2021-08-13","Full text: Milton is getting some federal help with its quest for two-way all-day GO Service. Federal Transportation Minister Omar Alghabra together with Milton MP Adam van Koeverden announced some additional funding for the Milton line through the National Trade Corridors fund. ""Two-way all-day Go train service in Milton is an absolute necessity. I heard from my neighbours directly in the mornings at the train station, and that is why I'm glad our government is making it a reality,"" van Koeverden said. Details on how much of the $1.9 billion fund were not made public, but officials in Alghabra's office revealed on background it will be approximately 50%. Ontario Minister of Transportation Caroline Mulroney is pressuring the federal government to make a firm commitment. ""We are very interested in the announcement made by the federal government, and look forward to seeing a funding commitment from them in writing,"" Mulroney said. Among the problems with the Milton line has been track ownership. Canada-Pacific (CP) owns the tracks, and there would need to be separation to allow for the movement of passenger traffic as well as freight. In a letter written yesterday to Alghabra, Mulroney suggests that federal funding could be used to build additional tracks. The lack of all-day service has been a key provincial issue for the last decade. A 2010 Cost-benefits study on expanding the Milton line estimates the capital costs at approximately $128 million. It also revealed that a Milton line would be making a profit by 2031. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to call a federal election within the coming days.

"2021-08-12","Full text: Longtime Athabasca NDP MLA Buckley Belanger is resigning his seat in the provincial legislature to seek the nomination for the federal Liberal Party. If successful in his bid, Belanger will run in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, which is currently held by Conservative MP Gary Vidal. In a surprise announcement, Belanger said switching parties reflects an opportunity to ""get things done for the people of northern Saskatchewan."" He will step down from his MLA role effective Aug. 15. While the government has not yet requested that the governor general dissolve Parliament and send Canadians to the polls, that is widely expected to happen later this month, culminating in a September vote. https://twitter.com/WotherspoonT/status/1425139453983666179 Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River has flipped parties regularly in the past and was held by former La Loche mayor Georgina Jolibois before Vidal won the seat in 2019. The last time a Liberal held the seat was from 2006 to 2007 when Gary Merasty was the area's MP. In the last federal election, the Liberal Party attempted to steal the seat with a high profile candidacy from Lac La Ronge Indian Band Chief Tammy Cook-Searson. She finished third with 26.5 per cent of the votes behind Jolibois (28.4) and Vidal (42.3). Belanger told Saskatchewan NDP Leader Ryan Meili about his decision on Friday night, said a party spokesman said. Caucus was informed Saturday morning. ""We're sorry to see Mr. Belanger leave our caucus and are grateful for his service as Saskatchewan's longest-serving Indigenous MLA,"" Meili said in a prepared statement. He pledged to focus ""on making sure there is a strong voice"" to take Belanger's place. https://twitter.com/PremierScottMoe/status/1425149435277975557 On Twitter, Premier Scott Moe thanked Belanger for his time as an MLA, nodding to his ""fiery speeches, his good nature (and) his sense of humour in the Assembly."" Belanger was first elected as MLA in 1995 and has served as minister under the portfolios of northern affairs; environment; community resources; and highways and transportation under premiers Roy Romanow and Lorne Calvert. He previously served as mayor of Ile-a-la Crosse from 1988 to 1994. Belanger cited the federal response to COVID-19 in northern communities as a key factor in joining the Liberals after years as an NDP MLA. Pointing to the three-way splits that have previously occurred in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, he asked voters to rally behind his candidacy and ""stop the split."" ""Having a voice in Ottawa will certainly help alleviate some of the stresses and challenges that we face in northern Saskatchewan,"" he said. Subject: Nominations"

"2021-09-22","Full text: Feds commit $321M for residential school impacts OTTAWA - The federal government is committing $321 million in new funding for Indigenous communities and appointing a special interlocutor to propose law and policy changes to better respond to the findings of hundreds of unmarked graves at former residential school sites. The announcement comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is widely expected to soon call an election in which his government's record on Indigenous reconciliation is set to be a major issue. Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett told a virtual news conference Tuesday the funding will include $83 million that will be added to an existing $27-million program to fund searches of burial sites and commemorate the children who died at residential schools. The funding will also include $107 million for programs to support healing from intergenerational trauma and $100 million over two years to help Indigenous communities manage residential school buildings, whether those plans include demolition, rehabilitation or construction of new facilities, the government said. The Liberal government will also set aside $20 million to build a national monument in Ottawa to honour the survivors and all the children who were lost. It will be a commemorative space where Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples can gather to ""express their collective grief and find a way forward to heal together,"" said Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault. Bennett said the government will also create a national advisory committee, made up of archeology, forensic, pathology and mental health experts, to advise Indigenous communities and the government about work to find and identify the children. Natan Obed, the president of Canada’s national Inuit organization, said the committee can have a ""very meaningful role"" in directing both the government and Indigenous communities to do the necessary work to achieve ""respect and dignity for all those affected by this terrible Canadian tragedy."" National Chief RoseAnne Archibald of the Assembly of First Nations welcomed the government announcement but said it is late. ""It's a long overdue step in acknowledging the devastating harm that these institutions have had and continue to have on many generations of our people,"" she told the news conference. She said residential schools were ""institutions of assimilation and genocide"" and the Canadian government along with the churches committed crimes against humanity at these facilities. ""I no longer want to call them schools,"" she said. ""Now is the time for accountability, action and healing."" Archibald said she looks forward to working with the new special interlocutor. The special interlocutor will work with Indigenous communities and the government to propose changes to federal laws, policies and practices related to unmarked graves at residential schools, said Justice Minister David Lametti. ""(The special interlocutor) will identify needed measures and recommend a new legal framework that respects the dignity of burial sites and Indigenous children,"" Lametti said. ""They will evaluate federal laws, policies and practices surrounding unmarked and undocumented graves and burial sites at residential schools, and set out responsibilities for their protection."" He said Canada currently does not have the necessary legal tools to deal with the complex issues presented by the findings of unmarked graves. ""I will admit that there have been moments during this time where I wish I had the powers that some have attributed to me and my office,"" he said. The special interlocutor will be selected following discussions with Indigenous leadership and communities and the individual's mandate will be to rebuild trust, Lametti said. David Chartrand of the Métis National Council said the announcements sends a message that Indigenous issues are ""a priority for the prime minister, a priority for his government."" ""This country is on a journey together … I ask all Canadians to join us in this journey, because it's going to take us time,"" he said. Chartrand also welcomed the government's intention to appoint a special interlocutor. ""We need to look at: How do we address the crimes of the past?"" he said. ""Our people out there, they're seeking justice."""

"2021-11-18","Full text: UN report 'must sound death knell' for oil, gas OTTAWA - The secretary-general of the United Nations says a new report ""must sound the death knell for coal and fossil fuels,"" raising renewed questions about Canada's climate plan and the long-term viability of its traditional energy sector. The UN scientific paper says Earth is heating up so quickly due to human activity that temperatures in about a decade will blow past a level of warming that world leaders have sought to prevent. Released Monday, the landmark study amounts to a ""'code red' for humanity"" as increasingly extreme heat waves, droughts, flooding and wildfires threaten the globe, said UN chief António Guterres. Federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson acknowledged that parts of Western and Northern Canada are warming at three times the global average, with the ramifications playing out in a cycle of floods and wildfires in British Columbia and elsewhere. The Liberal government has taken “aggressive climate action” through carbon pricing and a pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, he said in a statement. Amara Possian, Canada campaign director for 350.org, said the report is a ""clarion call"" that the country's climate plan falls far short. ""With an election around the corner and climate-fuelled wildfires still raging across this country, the real question is if our politicians are listening and if any of them will step up and be the climate champions that we need,"" she said in a statement. The advocacy group (named for a ""safe"" level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) is demanding a moratorium on fossil-fuel expansion and a halt to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The Petroleum Services Association of Canada sought to dampen any echoes of a death knell. ""At the end of the day we cannot go to renewables overnight, and the world still needs fossil fuels,"" Gurpreet Lail, head of the Calgary-based trade group, said in an email. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney pointed to carbon-capture technology as helping ring in a cleaner oilpatch, but deemed the idea of abandoning hydrocarbons ""utopian."" ""The flick of a switch is patently unrealistic,"" he told reporters Monday. ""The cost to human life would be incalculable."" The authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which calls climate change clearly caused by humans and ""unequivocal,"" makes more precise and warmer forecasts for the 21st century than it did last time it was issued in 2013. Each of five scenarios for the future, based on how much carbon emissions are cut, passes the more stringent of two thresholds set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. World leaders agreed then to try to limit warming to 1.5 C above levels in the late 19th century because problems mount quickly after that. The world has already warmed nearly 1.1 C since then. Under each scenario, the 3,949-page report said, the world will cross the 1.5-C warming mark in the 2030s, earlier than some past predictions. Warming has ramped up in recent years, data shows. Canada, along with the United States and Australia, is among the top three biggest carbon-dioxide emitters per capita in the world. Eddy Pérez from Climate Action Network said the report shows that limiting global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels is ""simply not negotiable."" ""It is the only choice for a safe and healthy future, and it’s still possible. We need to fight to restore our broken relationship with nature and with ourselves; we need to fight back against any delays to urgent climate action."" Opposition leaders weighed in Monday, with a stress on green jobs as a path to emissions reductions and economic stability. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole sidestepped a question on whether the bell tolls for fossil fuels and coal, but called climate change an ""urgent threat"" for Canada. “We will meet our Paris targets, we will reduce emissions, but we will also get people working,"" he told reporters. O'Toole cited the Tories' carbon-price policy on fuel — announced in April, after Conservative MPs spent years fighting a so-called carbon tax — stating that their climate plan will cut emissions by the 30 per cent committed to under the Paris Agreement while supporting more jobs. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of letting big polluters off easy, referring to the government's decision in 2018 to relax proposed carbon-price limits on large emitters. ""That price on pollution exempts the biggest polluters. People are asking, what's the point of that?"" Singh said. ""The only way forward is to make sure workers are the heart of the solution,"" he added, citing building retrofits, electric vehicles and public transit. Under the federal climate plan, the number of jobs in clean energy is expected to grow by nearly 50 per cent to 639,200 by 2030, in step with a sector GDP jump of 58 per cent, according to a June report from Clean Energy Canada. Green party Leader Annamie Paul called the UNreport's results ""frightening"" and ""sad,"" but said she hopes it will firm up Canadians' resolve on climate change. ""It's not just altruism or a concern for the planet that is moving the EU and the U.S. and China and all other major economies towards a green economy. What's moving them toward that is the competitive advantage that is going to give them, the jobs that is going to create,"" she said in a phone interview. Paul also said Canada has failed to hit a single climate target and seen its greenhouse gas emissions rise each year since 2015. The Liberal goal of up to 45 per cent reduction by 2030 falls short of the 60 per cent she has her sights on. ""The top note of the report is really that climate change is here, its impacts are already being felt. And the question now is, how bad do we want it to get?""

"2021-09-22","Full text: Grand Chief of Treaty 8 Arthur Noskey is asking all federal parties to include some form of mental health supports for victims of the residential school system in their platforms for an expected fall election. Noskey said in an interview that financial compensation has not been enough for many survivors that are still traumatized by the experience. He hopes to see parties address the generational and direct traumas that can be found in survivors, their families and communities. “I’d like to serve notice to all the political parties out there that they will have to address the Indian residential school system and restitution and basically resolve it,” said Noskey. “If there is a commitment [from all parties] then I think that goes further than being elected as the next government.” The Liberals have promised to renew funding of the Indian Residential Schools Health Supports Program and Crisis Line. The Conservatives have pledged to fund the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action involving missing children. The Greens have promised to implement all calls to action regarding residential schools, and fund new Indigenous healing centres. The NDP have yet to release a platform on the topic. Noskey, who was reelected to a second term on July 30, said Treaty 8 First Nations are developing plans to search the grounds of 11 former residential schools in the area later this month. This includes the Holy Angels Residential School in Fort Chipewyan. Treaty 8 includes all First Nations in the Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo area. Noskey said the sharing of traumatic memories and stories of what happened at many of the residential schools has become common in Indigenous communities as unmarked graves continue to be found. “We’re dealing with this on a consistent basis, because we are talking to the survivors and engaging with the community and its ongoing,” he said. “People have held this hurt, this pain, they kept it under a veil never to say anything but now more people are sharing their stories. Emotionally it’s hard but I believe it will eventually bring healing to survivors.” Noskey is not asking for an apology from Pope Francis for the Catholic Church’s involvement in the residential school system. Instead, he wants the church to formally repeal Inter Caetera, a Papal bull issued by Pope Alexander VI in 1493 often described as the Doctrine of Discovery. That edict, which was written to settle territorial disputes between Spain and Portugal, stated Europeans exploring the Americas had the “divine clemency to bring under your sway the said mainlands and islands with their residents and inhabitants to bring them to the Catholic faith.” In 2017, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishop’s rejected lands with an Indigenous population could be conquered. “I don’t want a pope apologizing,” said Noskey. “If anything I would ask a pope to issue a Papal Bull stating that those First Nations have treaties with the Imperial Crown, honour them. Because it looks like Canada is more on the side of what the Pope says versus honouring the treaties that they were supposed to be looking after on behalf of the Imperial Crown.” Noskey also wants Queen Elizabeth II to intervene. The monarch also serves as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, which includes the Anglican Communion. The Anglican church’s Canadian leadership formally apologized in 1993 for its role in the residential school system, as did the United Church in 1998. Some Catholic priests, bishops and organizations have apologized on behalf of the church and Pope Francis’ predecessor apologized to a group of survivors visiting the Vatican in 2009. But no pope has delivered a public apology. “It’s the 21st century but the residential school system is still having its effects and the Queen has to do something about it,” said Noskey. “Since Canada doesn’t want to do anything about it, we have to look at our sovereign partner to start looking our way more.” As grand chief, Noskey wants Indigenous communities to be involved in the province’s economic development plans as crude oil trades at its highest level in seven years. “I think it’s good that the economy is rebounding and I don’t want First Nations communities to stall the rebound,” said Noskey. -with reporting from Vincent McDermott smclean@postmedia.com Subject: Treaties; Native North Americans; Apologies"

"2021-08-11","Full text: Manitoba signs on to federal child-care plan WINNIPEG - Manitoba is signing on to the federal government’s plan to implement $10-a-day child care for families by 2023. ""It is no exaggeration to say this is the largest child-care deal ever struck by the province of Manitoba,"" Manitoba Families Minister Rochelle Squires said Monday. The Liberal government has committed $1.2 billion to the province over the next five years. Squires said the funds will also be used to create 23,000 early learning and child-care spaces for kids ages six and under. Squires said the historic agreement is particularly important due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted women in the province. Federal officials have been travelling the country in recent weeks, announcing agreements with some provinces to create a national child-care system. Manitoba's Tory government is the second conservative-led province to join on. Canada has already signed child-care deals with Quebec, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Yukon, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador. Federal Minister of Families Ahmed Hussen said each deal is unique to match the needs of the jurisdiction. But, he said, provinces and territories need to come on board with the plan. ""We will negotiate in good faith with all governments,” Hussen said during the announcement in Winnipeg. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said increased wages for educators is ""a sticking point for some"" provinces and territories that are still in negotiations. The funding for Manitoba sets a floor for a salary of $25 an hour to come into effect in the next fiscal year, Squires said. She added that recruitment and retention of early learning and childhood educators has been a significant challenge in Manitoba. Raquel Dancho, the federal Conservative critic for workforce development and disability inclusion, said Liberal governments have broken child-care promises for decades. ""Why should Canadians believe the Liberals now?"" Dancho said in a statement. ""Trudeau waited six years into his mandate to make these announcements on child care and it's no surprise that this comes before a possible election."" Manitoba's NDP also expressed concern that the commitments would not be met. Danielle Adams, the New Democrats child-care critic, said in a statement that ""Manitoba families don’t trust the (provincial Progressive Conservative) government to meet their child care needs."" Manitoba has the second-lowest child carefees in the country. Under the new plan, Manitoba families are to see a 50 per cent reduction in average fees in regulated child-care spaces by the end of 2022. Squires said she anticipates Manitoba could be the first province to meet the $10-a-day average. ""More women in the workforce is essential for Manitoba to grow and prosper,"" she said. ""We need a stronger child-care system to support and encourage women to join the workforce and contribute their knowledge, skills and talent.""

"2021-08-11","Full text: With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warning that Earth is warming faster than previously thought, and a federal election on the horizon, Canadian politicians of all stripes are casting themselves as the ones voters should trust with action. The IPCC’s Physical Science Basis of Climate Change report is an authoritative study of the planet’s greenhouse gas (GHG) problem, and it illustrates five scenarios from high to low emissions showing how actions taken today will decide what Earth looks like throughout the century. The IPCC’s best estimate in its lowest emission scenario sees continued warming held to 1.4 C, just shy of the Paris Agreement’s goal of 1.5 C, and no more than 2 C. Its highest emission scenario estimate of 4.4 C warming is a planetary catastrophe. In a statement, Canada’s Environment minister Jonathan Wilkinson said the science makes clear countries have to do more to address climate change faster, adding Canada isn’t immune. “Canada is warming at nearly twice the global rate. Parts of western and northern Canada are warming at three times the global average,” said Wilkinson in the statement. “Scientists have made a clear link between climate change and more frequent and powerful weather events, including heat waves, wildfires, flooding and sea ice loss. “The report makes clear that we find ourselves at a critical time for international climate action,” he said. Wilkinson highlighted Canada’s latest goal to reduce GHGs by 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, and its plan to invest $5.3 billion on climate issues over the next five years as evidence the country is headed in the right direction. “Reaching net-zero emissions is what the IPCC report reiterates the world must achieve if we are to keep 1.5 C within reach,” he said. As the IPCC report shows, the possibility of holding warming to 1.5 C will require much more than holding emissions to net-zero. In fact, the only scenarios that manage to prevent warming from crossing the dangerous 2 C threshold involve removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere after zero global emissions are achieved. [Graph via IPCC] The NDP’s environment critic Laurel Collins called it “disingenuous” for the federal government to say it’s addressing climate change when it subsidizes the fossil fuel industry. “One of the things I find most disturbing is that each time we get another clear report telling us that we are not on track, that our emissions are increasing rather than decreasing, the government comes out and says we are on track,” said Collins. “Since Justin Trudeau and the Liberals were elected in 2015, every year we've seen our greenhouse gas emissions increase, and we are the only G7 country where that is the case,” she added. In June, a study from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) found that since 2005 Canada’s emissions were down 1.2 per cent, but up 3.3 per cent since the Paris Agreement was signed. When the study came out, the department of Environment and Climate Change said 2019 was a high point and emissions would decline from 2020 on due to its climate policies. The department’s climate plan, A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy, outlines a suite of climate policies from increasing the carbon tax to $170/tonne in 2030, to investing hundreds of millions in the power grid, to a clean fuel standard. The department estimates if it can pull off the steps outlined in the plan it would be able to achieve 32 to 40 per cent GHG emission reductions from 2005 levels by 2030. That plan also holds up small modular reactors as a possible way to help decarbonize heavy industry, though Natural Resources Canada is leading the government’s small modular reactor ambitions. Commercial deployment isn’t envisioned until 2030, which could prove too little too late, given the IPCC’s latest report suggests the planet is warming faster than previously thought. ""We can’t put off action for ten years waiting for these technologies to be scalable or viable, and the idea that our government can continue with business as usual because carbon capture or SMR’s will save us in the future is deeply flawed,"" said Collins. When asked to comment, the Bloc Quebecois said it’s views haven’t changed from late last year when it said Ottawa was wrong to use taxpayer money to support nuclear power. Instead, the party believes the focus should be on technologies like renewable energy and energy efficiency. Green Party leader Annamie Paul said she hopes the IPCC report sparks an acknowledgement that Canada is one of the top polluters in the world. “We’ve never hit one of our climate targets … emissions have been going up year on year,” she said. “And we continue to bring online more fossil fuel projects that are pulling us further and further away from our goal.” Paul said that climate science is a very technical area, and that the government has essentially exploited the general public’s lack of climate literacy. She compared the federal government’s climate plans to a soufflé, saying “it looks substantial, but there’s not much underneath the surface.” It’s “always a challenge distinguishing between plans, and certainly something that, unfortunately, the government has used to its advantage in presenting what definitely is an inadequate climate plan as something that is going to help Canada do its fair share,” she said. In a statement, climate advocacy group 350’s Canada’ campaign director Amara Possian said the IPCC report is a “clarion call” that Canada’s climate plan is “nowhere near enough.” “With an election around the corner and climate fueled wildfires still raging across this country, the real question is if our politicians are listening and if any of them will step up and be the climate champions that we need.” The Conservative Party did not immediately return requests for comment.

"2021-08-11","Full text: Longtime Ontario premier Bill Davis dies at 92 TORONTO - Bill Davis, the 18th premier of Ontario and one of the country's longest-serving premiers, has died at 92. A statement from his family says Davis was surrounded by his relatives when he died Sunday morning of natural causes in Brampton, Ont. The pipe-chomping Tory titan, often called Ontario's ""education premier,"" held the position from 1971 to 1985, taking over from the late John Robarts. His stretch in power, which culminated in him stepping down at the height of his popularity, effectively ended his party's unprecedented, 42-year rule of the province. Davis won four elections, two minority governments bookended by two majorities, though his influence extended far beyond Ontario's borders. He was a key player in Pierre Trudeau's crusade to patriate the Constitution, which later came back to haunt Davis when he was touted to lead the federal Conservatives. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Davis's death. ""He was a skilled statesman who set aside partisanship and worked with my father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, to bring forward concrete change and uphold our shared values, like diversity and human rights, through the creation of the Charter,"" Trudeau said in a statement. Premier Doug Ford said Davis served Ontario ""with honour and distinction"" and flags across the province will lowered to half-mast in his honour. ""While his accomplishments as Premier are too many to list, he will be remembered most for the kindness and decency with which he carried himself every day,"" Ford said in a statement. Former Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien said Davis was ""one of the best politicians, political personalities I've met in my life."" ""He was very decent, he was very calm, he was very much a gentleman,"" Chretien said in an interview. ""He was representing the best values of Canada."" Former Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney described Davis as one of Canada's greatest premiers. ""He was a source of advice and counsel to me always, and I valued it greatly, especially in my early days as leader and then in our Constitutional battles,"" Mulroney said. ""Bill Davis was an entirely admirable human being, a man of great integrity and judgement."" Davis's family said a private funeral will be planned, followed by a public celebration to be announced at a later date. Hailing from Brampton, William Grenville Davis's lifelong passion for politics began at age 15, when he attended a federal Conservative annual meeting. Davis attended Osgoode Hall Law School at York University and the University of Toronto, where the star high-school quarterback played football with future cabinet ministers Roy McMurtry and Thomas Wells. McMurtry, who was three years younger than Davis, recalled that the future premier was not to be underestimated — either on the field or in the political arena — despite his ""very laid-back personality in the minds of many people."" ""I realized at that early stage that he was a highly competitive person,"" McMurtry said in a 2008 interview. ""And I say that because I think a number of political colleagues and political opponents — particularly political opponents — underestimated his highly competitive nature, which he did not wear on his sleeve."" His political career began when the lawyer was hand-picked by cabinet minister and interim premier Thomas Kennedy to run in his riding of Peel, winning the seat in 1959. He nearly lost the election, due to former prime minister John Diefenbaker's decision to cancel the Avro Arrow, putting 14,000 employees — most of whom lived in the riding — out of work. Just before he died, Kennedy reportedly told his successor Leslie Frost, ""I've found a future premier of Ontario."" Davis's ascent to power seemed to be written in the stars. At age 33, he landed in cabinet as Ontario's new education minister — one of the most important jobs in government. That same year, his young wife Helen died of cancer after a long illness, leaving behind their four children. He married his second wife Kathleen a year later and together, they had a daughter, Meg. Davis's career took off during his nine years in education — a time of massive change in Ontario schools — and he is credited with creating the province's Community College System. In those days, Ontario's population was booming and education was a top-spending ministry, consuming about 40 per cent of the provincial budget. Davis became the first minister of University Affairs less than two years later, creating two new universities, dramatically reducing the number of school boards and establishing public broadcaster TVOntario as an educational initiative. He also cultivated a following as he criss-crossed the province to open new schools, which served him well when he launched his leadership drive after then-premier Robarts quit in 1970. It was a tough contest, but Davis managed to beat rival Allan Lawrence by a mere 44 votes. He was sworn in as premier on March 1, 1971. Rarely seen without his pipe or Beatles boots, Davis earned a reputation for being cautious and playing his cards close to the chest. He delayed decisions until the last possible moment, often frustrating journalists with rambling replies to their prying questions. Even in his 80s, decades after he'd left the political spotlight, Davis couldn't help toying with reporters. When he tired of their questions, he'd suggest his own — then refuse to answer. His detractors called him wishy-washy, a leader without vision, a man whose propensity for procrastination was almost pathological. But ""Brampton Bill"" kept winning. Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown tweeted Sunday that Davis was his city's ""most beloved resident ... Ontario's most successful premier and the definition of decency."" Asked to explain his electoral success despite his dull image, Davis summed it up in two words: ""Bland works."""

In 2019, health officials in London, Ont. reported a high-school-aged youth was on life support after smoking e-cigarettes, but had since recovered. The Middlesex-London Health Unit said the youth was in the intensive care unit with a severe pulmonary illness. The vaping-related illness was believed to be the first confirmed case in Canada. An article, published November 21st in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, was written by six doctors who treated the 17-year-old boy during a 47-day hospital stay. They said he went from being in perfect health to being on life support after just five months of regularly using e-cigarettes. The article outlined his hospitalization in early 2019, during which he spent time on life support and narrowly averted a double-lung transplant. In 2019, the Liberals launched into damage control mode after a photo was published by Time magazine showing party leader Justin Trudeau in “brownface” makeup at a 2001 costume party. The picture was taken at an “Arabian Nights” party at a B-C private school. Another two photos and then a video soon emerged showing Trudeau also in ""blackface."" That left Trudeau apologizing for what he called a terrible mistake and that he was angry with himself for being so dumb. Time magazine posted the photo, which was published in the yearbook from the West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver where Trudeau worked as a teacher before entering politics. Trudeau says when he sought public office he never told anyone that he had worn ""blackface"" years earlier because he was too embarrassed. He says he acted as a person raised with privilege that blinded him from the realities of racism.

The Bloc leader was already in self-isolation, along with much of his caucus and other aides, after a staff member contracted COVID-19. Hours later, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole also tested positive for COVID-19. Quebec Premier Francois said he would get tested because he had met with O'Toole earlier in the week. In 2020, the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada announced her intention to step down. As the country headed into a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tina Namiesniowski said in a letter to staff that after six months responding to the crisis, she needed a break. She thanked Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, for her support and said they'd made ""an exceptional team."" In 2020, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died at 87. The diminutive yet towering women's rights champion, who became the court's second female justice, died at her home in Washington of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer.

An expert testified that hydroelectric dams like Muskrat Falls are particularly vulnerable to cost and schedule overruns. In 2018, Amazon's The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel became the first streaming series to win an Emmy for best comedy and HBO's Game of Thrones recaptured best drama series honours at the 70th Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. Game of Thrones won a total of nine Emmys, just ahead of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and NBC's enduring sketch series Saturday Night Live, which won eight apiece. In 2019, Cokie Roberts, journalist and longtime political reporter and analyst at ABC News and NPR, died at age 75. A family statement said she died of complications from breast cancer. Roberts was the daughter of Hale and Lindy Boggs, two members of Congress from Louisiana, and went on to chronicle the political world she grew up in. She joined ABC News in 1988 and was co-anchor with Sam Donaldson of the Sunday political show ""This Week"" from 1996 to 2002. In 2019, Canadian ice dancing stars Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir announced they were stepping away from the sport after 22 years. The pair announced their retirement in a video posted on their separate Twitter accounts. The pair were expected to retire following a gold-medal performance at the Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea in 2018, but had not made an official announcement. The pair announced a farewell Canada-wide Rock the Rink Tour that began in Abbotsford, B-C and ended in St. John's, Newfoundland. In 2019, Suzanne Whang, whose smooth voice provided the narration for HGTV's ""House Hunters'' for years, died after a long battle with breast cancer. She was 57. Whang first gained fame as the on-screen host of the show, where anxious home buyers are shown trying to choose between three potential options. In 2020, author Winston Groom, whose novel ''Forrest Gump'' was made into a six-Oscar winning 1994 movie that became a soaring pop cultural phenomenon, died at 77. In 2020, the smash Canadian comedy series ""Schitt's Creek'' won its first Emmy Award. Actor Eugene Levy, one of the stars and co-creators of the show, congratulated John Comerford and Lisa Parasyn on Twitter for winning the Emmy for Outstanding Casting For a Comedy Series. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Stock exchanges; Professional football; Emmy awards; West Nile virus; World War II; Demonstrations & protests; Prime ministers; Military history"
"2021-09-18","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Sept. 16 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 16 ... What we are watching in Canada ... With less than a week to go before Monday's federal election, the three main party leaders are continuing their tours of Eastern and Central Canada. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is back home in Montreal, where he will make an announcement in the morning. Conservative boss Erin O'Toole is visiting two Atlantic provinces, starting with an announcement in Saint John, N.B., and ending with an evening event with supporters in Truro, N.S. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh is staying in Ontario, with an affordable housing announcement in Toronto in the morning, followed by visits with supporters in Oshawa and Kingston. Affordability was the hot topic yesterday after Statistics Canada reported prices increased by 4.1 per cent in August compared with the same month one year earlier, fuelled by rising consumer demand and supply-chain constraints for many goods. Singh and O'Toole blamed rising prices on what they called Trudeau's inaction on multiple fronts, including the country's hot housing sector. --- Also this ... As Alberta faces a COVID-19 crisis that threatens to collapse its health system in just over a week, Premier Jason Kenney has reintroduced limits on gatherings along with elements of a vaccine passport system. The United Conservative government declared a state of public health emergency on Wednesday, asking for help from other provinces to use their intensive care beds and staff while prepping its triage protocols, which would see doctors forced to choose who gets life-saving treatment and who does not. ""Unless we slow (virus) transmission, particularly amongst unvaccinated Albertans, we simply will not be able to provide adequate care to everyone who gets sick,"" Kenny said, adding hospitals may run out of staff and intensive care beds within the next 10 days. Alberta has more than 18,000 active COVID-19 cases, by far the highest in Canada. There are 269 patients in intensive care in a system set up for 173. Of the 269 patients in ICUs, 218 have COVID-19 -- the vast majority unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Alberta has been lagging on vaccinations, with less than 72 per cent of those 12 and older fully immunized. To stem transmission, Kenney's government introduced an array of measures including a form of the vaccine passport. Starting Sept. 20, people will need to show proof of vaccination to enter select non-essential businesses, including retail shops, restaurants, nightclubs, casinos, concerts and libraries. However, businesses that opt out of the program can operate at reduced capacity and with distancing rules or restrictions, such as no more than six people at a table in a restaurant. --- And this ... The president of the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation says it's illogical that students who are exposed to classmates who are COVID-19 positive are not required to self-isolate. Patrick Maze says the exemption made by the government does nothing to protect children. Close-contact pupils can continue to go to school following exposure, but are excluded from extracurricular activities and must wear masks unless eating. Only students who have been exposed outside a school setting must self-isolate. The Ministry of Health did not respond to a request for comment. A public health order says close contact pupils are exempt from isolation, so that parents don’t have to deal with the burden of taking time off work. Just over 20 per cent of COVID-19 cases in Saskatchewan are in children 12 and under, who are ineligible for a vaccine. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... BOSTON (AP) — Voters in the city have for the first time narrowed the field of mayoral candidates to two women of colour who will face off against each other in November. City councillors Michelle Wu and Annissa Essaibi George bested acting Mayor Kim Janey, Coun. Andrea Campbell and John Barros, the city’s former economic development chief, in this week's preliminary runoff. Whoever wins on Nov. 2 will make history in a city where the mayor's office has been held by a white man for the past 200 years. Earlier this year, Janey became the first Black Bostonian and first woman to occupy the city’s top office in an acting capacity after former mayor Marty Walsh stepped down to become President Joe Biden’s labour secretary. All of the candidates were Democrats. Mayoral races in Boston do not include party primaries. Wu was elected to the Boston city council in 2013 at age 28, becoming the first Asian-American woman to serve on the council. In 2016, she was elected city council president by her colleagues in a unanimous vote, becoming the first woman of colour to serve as president. Essaibi George won a series of key endorsements during the race including from unions representing firefighters, nurses and emergency medical technicians. She also won the backing of former Boston police commissioner William Gross. Essaibi George grew up in the city’s Dorchester neighbourhood and taught in the Boston Public Schools. She was elected to the city council in 2015. Her father immigrated to the United States from Tunisia in 1972. Her mother was born in a displaced persons’ camp in Germany of Polish parents. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... KABUL, Afghanistan — An Afghan man who was killed in a U.S. drone strike last month was an enthusiastic longtime employee at an American humanitarian organization, say his colleagues, who paint a stark contrast to the Pentagon’s claims that he was an Islamic State group's militant about to carry out an attack on American troops. Signs have been mounting that the U.S. military may have targeted the wrong man in the Aug. 29 strike in Kabul, with devastating consequences, killing seven children and two other adults from the man's family. The Pentagon says it's further investigating the airstrike, but it has no way to do so on the ground after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Accounts from the family, documents from colleagues seen by The Associated Press, and the scene at the family home — where Zemerai Ahmadi’s car was struck by a Hellfire missile just as he pulled into the driveway — all seem to sharply contradict the accounts by the U.S. military. Instead, they paint the picture of a family that had worked for Americans and were trying to gain visas to the United States, fearing for their lives under the Taliban. The family wants the United States to hear their side of the story and see the facts on the ground. “We just want that they come here. See what they did. Talk to us. Give us the proof,” Emal Ahmadi, Zemerai’s younger brother, said of the U.S. military. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged he did not know if the man targeted in the strike was an IS operative or an aid worker. “I don’t know because we’re reviewing it,” he said at a Senate foreign relations committee hearing. --- On this day in 1974 ... The first female recruit was sworn in as a member of the RCMP. Thirty-two women began training in Regina on Sept. 23, 1974, and later became the force's first female troop. Today, women undergo the same training as male constables and are assigned duties on the same basis. --- In entertainment ... TORONTO — Kristen Stewart says she sees the role of Diana as part of a body of art that seeks to bring people closer to the larger-than-life figure, and she doesn't presume to possess special insight into the reality of the late Princess of Wales after portraying her in ""Spencer."" Billed as ""a fable from a true tragedy,"" ""Spencer"" conjures the private turmoil of the so-called ""People's Princess"" as she endures a tense Christmas holiday with the Royal Family. Appearing remotely for a live talk at the hybrid Toronto International Film Festival, Stewart says she hopes ""Spencer"" doesn't contribute to the public invasion of privacy that has plagued Diana's life and legacy. The actor says the film doesn't present new biographical details or ""profess to know anything"" about the royal icon, who died at age 36 in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997. Stewart says the project instead seeks to honour Diana's preternatural power to foster human connection. ""I've been asked a lot about whether or not it's cool to try to tell someone's story when they're not around,"" Stewart said at a TIFF digital talk Wednesday before the film's premiere. ""We can imagine and dream and write poetry about how she makes us feel, and (try) to get closer to her and how she felt. I think that she provides this incredibly lush and complicated terrain to make art about."" --- ICYMI ... COPENHAGEN, Denmark — A cassette tape of a 33-minute audio recording four Danish teenagers had with John Lennon half a century ago will be auctioned later this month. The tape includes an apparently unpublished song by the late Beatle. The four 16-year-olds did the interview on Jan. 5, 1970. At the height of the Vietnam War and the Cold War, Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono had “a message of peace, and that was what was important to us,” recalled Karsten Hoejen. The tape chiefly consists of Lennon and Ono speaking about being in Denmark and world peace, Hoejen said Wednesday. Alternative societies mushroomed in Denmark from the late 1960s, attracting people from abroad, and music festivals were organized inspired by those on the Isle of Wight and Woodstock. The four youths wanted to interview Lennon for their school magazine but turned up late for the official press conference. They knocked on the door and moments later they sat next to the British musician and Ono. At some point, “someone ... I cannot recall who ... asked Lennon if could play the guitar for us.” He played and sang with Ono ‘Give peace a chance’ and “then they sang ‘Radio Peace.’” It was made for a radio station in The Netherlands but was never aired, Hoejen said. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 16, 2021 Subject: COVID-19 vaccines; Councils; Displaced persons; International relations; Extracurricular activities; Families & family life; Public health; Presidents; Women; Coronaviruses; Immunization; Intensive care; Cities; Armed forces; Disease transmission"
"2021-09-17","Full text: A new elections-issues survey shows most businesses in the Greater Vancouver area — the most populous in British Columbia — support increasing efforts to attract highly skilled immigrants. The survey, conducted by the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade (GVBOT) in collaboration with Mustel Group, found that a significant majority (72 percent) of businesses support increasing efforts to attract highly skilled immigrants, while an even larger proportion (76 percent) would like to see the next federal government increase efforts to improve credential recognition for the same. “Businesses are calling for a plan to find workers focused on developing skills in our local market and offsetting what we don’t have by welcoming skilled immigrants,” said Bridgitte Anderson, President & CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade. The survey found that while the majority of respondents among businesses and the general public believe the current level of immigration should be maintained, over one-third of businesses support increasing the rate of immigration. According to the GVBOT, labour issues, including the recruitment and retention of workers, are the most prevalent challenges businesses are facing as they recover from COVID-19, with 50 percent of respondents indicating it is their key challenge. For the region’s business community, other top issues were the economy and economic recovery (44 percent) and the business environment, such as the regulation and taxation schemes (34 percent). This was followed by the environment and climate change (30 percent), fiscal responsibility (29 percent), government ethics, honesty and leadership (26 percent) and taxes (22 percent). For the general population, 49 percent of residents cited the environment and climate change, and affordability and the cost of living (36 percent each), as the top issues. The economy and economic recovery (33 percent), government ethics, honesty and leadership (33 percent) and fiscal responsibility (24 percent), were also in the top five issues. “We see growing concern about affordability in a region already acknowledged as one the most expensive cities in the world relative to our income levels,” said Evi Mustel, President of Mustel Group. The survey included a total of 267 GVBOT members and 500 Metro Vancouver adults, 18 years of age or over with a margin of error +/-5.8 percent and +/-4.4 percent, respectively, at the 95 percentile level of confidence. Among the hardest hit by the shortage of workers in B.C. and across Canada is the restaurant industry, which has seen more than 10,000 eateries closing permanently because of the pandemic. According to a Metro Vancouver Restaurant Labour Shortage report authored by the British Columbia Restaurant and Foodservices Association, restaurants are the third largest private sector employer in the province. “In the Metro Vancouver area, the restaurant industry is thriving with estimated year-over-year growth of three per cent, but with new businesses opening, operators are struggling to keep up with recruiting needs,” the report states. Sanjay Pandey, owner of the Charqui Grill in the Kitsilano area of Vancouver, says everyone he knows “in the restaurant business is looking for workers, especially skilled kitchen help.” “Many of the workers in the industry have not returned after collecting the COVID benefits from the government,” he told New Canadian Media. Another segment facing critical labour shortages is the trucking industry. The BC Trucking Association (BCTA) said the province’s truck driver shortage increased 302 percent between 2015 and 2019, leaving 3,710 vacant positions. Wesley Richards, who operates Class One Drivers in Surrey, which recruits long haul truck drivers for transportation companies across Canada, said there are nearly 20,000 vacant truck driver positions in Canada. “I have several clients who are waiting for foreign workers whose visa applications are stuck in a growing backlog at Canada’s foreign missions,” he said. “I hope the next government will be able to streamline the process between Service Canada and (Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship) Canada to ease this critical shortage.” Subject: Noncitizens; Economic recovery; Labor shortages; Restaurants; Climate change; Immigration; COVID-19"
"2021-09-17","Full text: Panel of UN experts denounces Texas abortion law WASHINGTON - A ""regressive"" abortion ban in Texas has left the United States in violation of international law, and the Supreme Court — the ultimate guardian of the landmark 1973 ruling that makes it legal — is complicit, a United Nations expert panel declared Tuesday. President Joe Biden's administration has vowed to challenge the law in court, and Democrats are already aggressively fundraising on the issue, nervously eyeing their tenuous hold on Congress as the 2022 midterm elections loom large. With Canada in the throes of a federal campaign that features a resurgent Conservative party and the spectacle of U.S.-style anti-vaccination rallies, some fear the long-term erosion of abortion rights north of the border as well. ""I kind of wonder what it means in terms of the public getting used to the idea of abortion restrictions, and that's really scary,"" said Joyce Arthur, executive director of the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. The Texas law, which took effect Sept. 1, bans abortions after embryonic heart activity is detected, which is typically at the six-week mark. That's too little time for many women to even realize they are pregnant, critics say. It also avoids constitutional issues by expanding the ability of virtually anyone to file a civil suit against abortion providers, doctors or anyone else who ""aids or abets"" a patient seeking to get the procedure after the legal threshold. Just minutes before the law was scheduled to take effect Sept. 1, the Supreme Court quietly voted 5-4 against blocking it, conjuring fears that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established the constitutional right to an abortion, could be hanging in the balance. The UN panel, an independent group of special rapporteurs and leaders of working groups operating with the support of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Texas of circumventing the U.S. Constitution. The law also disproportionately targets women who can't afford to travel outside the state, a proportion of the Texas population that is dominated by people of colour, the experts said in a statement. The law ""deputizes"" ordinary citizens by offering financial incentives to enforce it in the civil courts — what the panel called a clear violation of human rights that will foster stigma and fear among women, and risk inciting violence against anyone who tries to help them. ""With the passage of the Texas law, the United States stands in violation of international law,"" the panel said in a statement. A number of other U.S. states, including Georgia, Mississippi, Kentucky and Ohio, have also passed similar so-called ""heartbeat"" laws, but they remain in legal limbo as a result of legal challenges. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an avowed opponent of abortion rights, has also mused about following the Texas lead, but officials in that state have since tried to distance his administration from the idea of financial incentives. What happens in the U.S. can have a major impact on what happens elsewhere in the world, said Melissa Upreti, a panel member and the chair of the UN Working Group on Discrimination Against Women and Girls. ""We see this as a serious retrogression in the United States,"" Upreti said in an interview. ""What has happened in the United States is not good for other countries. And it is a concern that others might now feel emboldened because I think those who are opposed to women's abortion rights are seeing this as a major victory."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, whose party has long been a lightning rod for the abortion debate, tried to ground himself against a campaign shock from the outset of the campaign, declaring himself to be pro-choice. O'Toole has also said he would not block members of his Conservative caucus from proposing their own private member's bills to restrict abortion, and would allow them to vote their conscience on such legislation. Arthur, for one, said she's not overly concerned about a similar challenge to abortion rights in Canada, ""a very different place than the U.S."" But like many Canadians following the campaign, she's noticed some decidedly American flourishes, notably the legions of protesters showing up at hospitals and Liberal rallies to denounce Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plan to impose mandatory COVID-19 vaccination rules for travellers. Trudeau — who was pelted with gravel at one campaign stop — and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh have both proposed tougher criminal penalties for anyone blocking access to hospitals, vaccine clinics, testing centres, pharmacies and abortion clinics, or otherwise intimidating or harassing health-care workers. ""This behaviour of going to all of Trudeau's campaign stops and yelling and screaming obscenities at him and throwing rocks — I mean, that's just disgusting,"" Arthur said. ""I do have hope and faith that the progressives in the world are still overall a majority of people, hopefully, and there's still lots of good things going on in the world."" Both Arthur and Upreti pointed to the example of Mexico, where that country's Supreme Court delivered a sweeping decision last week that declared it unconstitutional to punish abortion. ""At the end of the day, it really depends on what people themselves choose to be inspired by or influenced by,"" Upreti said, citing Canada as a model for its defence of human rights and gender equality around the world. ""One would hope that in Canada, people would be more inspired by those things, rather than retrogression south of the border."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 14, 2021.

The move was announced just ahead of an audience with U.S. church leaders over an abuse and coverup scandal roiling the Catholic Church. In 2019, Cameron Jay Ortis was charged with breaching Canada's secrets law while serving with the RCMP. Ortis, 47, was charged under three sections of the Security of Information Act as well as two Criminal Code provisions for allegedly trying to disclose classified information. The charge sheet listed a total of seven counts against Ortis under the various provisions, two of them dating from as early as Jan. 1, 2015, through to Thursday, Sept. 12 when he was arrested. The RCMP said the charges stemmed from activities alleged to have occurred during his time as a force employee, suggesting he was active with the Mounties upon being taken into custody. The Security of Information Act, ushered in following the 9/11 attacks in the United States, is intended to safeguard sensitive government information. In 2019, actress Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison for her role in the sweeping college admissions scandal. The ""Desperate Housewives"" star was sentenced in Boston's federal court after pleading guilty in May to a single count of conspiracy and fraud.

"2021-09-12","Full text: John Harding has never gotten used to the stink. Every time he neared the G & R Recycling site and the waters that flow by its operations on Kanehsatake land, his nose filled with “the smell of opening a septic tank and sticking your head inside. That’s how bad it is,” said Harding. “And at every level, people knew what was going on.” That stench signaled an ongoing hazard to the local environment and community, repeatedly documented, but knowingly allowed to persist by governing bodies. This is the finding of an extensive investigation by The Eastern Door that draws on additional research by a coalition of organizations made up of Onkwehón:we and settler advocates working with ReconciliAction; Eau Secours, a non-profit dedicated to the protection of waterways; and waste management watchdog, Front commun québécois pour une gestion écologique des déchets (FCQGED). The investigation reveals that over a five-year period, regulators repeatedly discovered G & R Recycling was releasing contaminants, some toxic, into streams that run through its lot, trickling past agricultural land, down into the Lake of Two Mountains, which meets the Ottawa River. “The government agencies that were and are still involved, all turned a blind eye at the time,” said Harding. “Today, they have a responsibility to make this right.” G & R Recycling is a sorting centre for construction and demolition materials permitted to operate on the territory since 2016, until the provincial Ministry of Environment and Climate Change revoked its operating permit in October of 2020. Owned by community members Gary and Robert Gabriel, the company was on the receiving end of noncompliance orders and fines for nearly as long as it was in business. The centre’s co-owner, Robert Gabriel, said G & R was originally meant to operate under the guidance of two non-band members who claimed to have the expertise and equipment needed to efficiently run a business in the industry of recycling. Those partners were “thrown out” in 2017, said Gabriel, who is critical of their performance. But the problem persisted and the province wanted the owners to pay related fines and cleanup costs. Government inspection reports obtained through access to information (ATI) requests revealed G & R repeatedly violated the terms of its license. A spokesperson with the department told The Eastern Door it had begun issuing fines to the company on October 26, 2017. “After rigorous monitoring of the site and as soon as any deficiencies were noted, the department intervened on the site,” said Caroline Cloutier, spokesperson for the Quebec environment ministry, adding that the total amount payable by the offender is now $17,883.28. “Subsequently, the notification of (revocation) ordinance no. 689 without notice in order to avoid serious or irreparable damage being caused to humans, ecosystems, other living species, the environment or property, was made in December 2019.” Documents obtained by The Eastern Door tell a story of ongoing pollution, repeated warnings and demands by the provincial regulator. January 16, 2017 The provincial ministry issued its first known order to the company following an inspection conducted on December 19, 2016. The notice stated that while the site was under construction, G & R violated conditions set forth in Quebec’s Environment Quality Act. September 12, 2017 The ministry issued a new order stating G & R had received materials, including fine residues, which are not permitted under the environment act or its authorization license. The ministerial inspector also found that the company had exceeded the 27,800 cubic metres of residual materials it was allowed to store, and that it had failed to install the wastewater system required under its permit. The notice states the company’s increase in production is susceptible to an emission, deposit or rejection of contaminants in the environment, or a modification of the quality of environment. November 6, 2019 While the recycling plant’s licence allowed it to hold roughly 27,800 cubic metres of residual materials in an authorized area on-site, an inspection on this day shows the company holding an approximate 400,219 cubic metres in materials – more than 14 times the allowable volume. About 70 percent of the total storage of waste was located outside the authorized storage zone. During the same inspection in November 2019, the ministerial inspector observed the presence of dark water with an intense odour on the site. Water samples were collected at different points along the two streams that flow through the centre’s lot, both upstream and downstream. Results of testing done by the ministry, obtained by The Eastern Door through ATI requests, indicate the presence of various metals, sulfur, other chemicals, and bacterias at levels that threaten aquatic life. The toxic stew also harmed healthy oxygen levels. The effect was to “diminish the oxygen in the water which can change the population of species found in the water bodies,” explained Lise Parent, biologist and professor of environment at Université du Québec’s TÉLUQ University. The environment ministry’s aquatic life criteria for chronic concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BDO) is set at 3 mg/L. A water sample collected by the ministerial inspector downstream from G & R, in the Gratton stream flowing into the Lake of Two Mountains, showed a level of 37 mg/L on December 16, 2019. December 16, 2019 An inspection report by the ministry indicates that the wastewater produced by the recycling centre continued to leak into water following their previous visit on November 6, 2019. The report said that following the inspection, the department issued an order on December 6, 2019, for the company to stop allowing contaminated water from the site to leach into the environment. Various inspection reports from 2020, viewed by The Eastern Door, indicated the company did not respect that order. Samples collected at the site’s point of resurgence showed an ammoniacal nitrogen concentration 13,000 percent higher than the natural concentration upstream from the G & R site. This form of nitrogen is known as toxic to aquatic life. The contaminant’s ammonia can also make it difficult to treat water intended for human consumption. Sarah Dorner, professor in the Department of Civil, Geological and Mining Engineering at university Polytechnique Montréal, noted the presence of lead and zinc in the reports posed “a concern for users of the water.” April 28, 2020 In fact, the ministry was worried about how G & R’s contaminants might be affecting people in the area. A ministerial inspection report dated April 28, 2020, obtained through an ATI request, revealed that the inspector was informed that the “totality of residences located around the sorting centre draw their drinking water through surface water wells.” Among these residences, at least one home is known to have a surface well collecting water from the Gratton stream a few dozen meters downstream from G & R. Dorner told The Eastern Door it could be risky to drink from such wells. “It’s never good to exceed chronic levels, but especially when it’s a continued source of contamination like this one where water always flows,” noted Dorner. “We can see that the site clearly contaminates the streams with metals, so if I was asked whether I would drink the water drawn from this source, I would say no.” May 27, 2020 Michel Savard, a consultant with Quebec’s Health Department, sent an email calling for more drinking water testing after samples had been taken in the streams contaminated by the site the prior month. Savard’s email to the environment ministry, obtained through an ATI request, stated additional testing would be “relevant to assess the number of wells that may be vulnerable to contaminants from the site under investigation.” August 1, 2020 Richard Labonté, mayor of the neighbouring municipality of St. Placide, having been informed by a citizen about an unknown black substance in a stream flowing near the G & R plant and into the Lake of Two Mountains, alerted authorities. “It was oily, black-ish water, with a kind of greasy film on it,” recalled Labonté, who at the time requested an intervention by Urgence-Environnement, a department of the environment ministry. “We found it aberrant to see the flow of water coming from a place where it was not treated,” said the mayor. “This is what was the hardest to understand: why the water was not treated before being returned to nature.”"

"2021-09-11","Full text: Kamal Khera’s second parliamentary term stood in stark contrast to her first. The Liberal incumbent ended her maiden term as a parliamentarian in 2019 after speaking occasionally in the House of Commons and holding parliamentary assistant roles, coveted jobs that offer direct access to key cabinet decision-makers. But during her first term, Khera delivered few tangible wins for the residents of Brampton West, despite the relatively significant profile given to her by the ruling Liberals. The rookie MP’s judgement and lack of experience — she was 26 when elected and had very little work experience after briefly being employed as a nurse — caught up with her quickly. In 2016, the Brampton West representative accepted a seven-day trip to Tanzania from World Vision (which lobbies politicians and spent more than $5,000 on her travel to Africa) which was forbidden in her role as a parliamentary secretary, as the National Post reported. Public records show she met with World Vision lobbyists eight times after her Africa trip since December 2016, and as recently as the end of this past May. She also went on the controversial 2018 trip to India, along with Justin Trudeau and many other South Asian-Canadian Liberal MPs who were grilled about the high cost of the diplomatically disastrous trip and the lavish spending — $17,000 was spent to fly celebrity chef Vikram Vij there to prepare a meal for one of the elaborate functions. Brampton’s rookie MPs, including Khera, had nothing to show after their taxpayer-funded excursion, in terms of what was achieved for their constituents. Her questionable judgment continued during the 2019 election campaign. Khera egregiously doctored a video clip from a televised debate to misrepresent what her Conservative opponent, at the time, said regarding women’s rights and protections for abortion. It was clear the candidate thought he was responding to the previous question by the Prime Asia Television moderator and responded, no. When the moderator clarified what he was asking the Conservative stated that he fully supported women’s rights and would be a champion of women, if elected. The network’s manager, Nitin Chopra, told The Pointer that Khera’s campaign team tried to pressure him and threatened action if the debate was aired without the initial response when the Conservative candidate clearly thought he was answering to the previous question, which had nothing to do with women’s rights. When the full version of the debate was aired, Khera edited the clip to make it look like her Conservative candidate said he would not support women’s rights and she posted the doctored version on social media. She refused to answer questions after Prime Asia publicly voiced concern over her behaviour. She was returned to Ottawa for a second term with another comfortable win over her Conservative challenger. Khera’s track record during the pandemic has raised more concern about her suitability as a member of parliament. In the last term she spoke in the main chamber on just 16 days over the past two years. Khera was also quiet in committee, making 77 interventions. Then, at the start of the year Khera lost her special privileges when she was forced to resign her role as a parliamentary assistant after it was revealed that she quietly left Canada to visit the United States at the height of the pandemic’s second wave when such travel was prohibited. A comment from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the time suggested the Brampton West representative was instructed to resign her posts. “I was disappointed to find out [about] two of our caucus members who travelled and [that is] why there were consequences in them resigning from their committee roles,” Trudeau said. “That’s why all Canadians were so disappointed to see so many examples of folks who should have known better doing things that put us all at risk.” In a January statement, Khera said her trip to Seattle, Washington, was to “attend a private memorial of less than 10 people” for her late uncle, who passed away in the fall of 2020. She left Canada on December 23 and returned on December 31. She did not respond to questions at the time and was not available during the campaign for an interview ahead of publication. Prior to her misstep and public embarrassment over her travel to the U.S. and the loss of her previous parliamentary roles, there was a noticeable gap in Khera’s legislative record between March 12 and December 7, 2020. Over the course of almost nine months, she did not speak once in the House of Commons, continuing to contribute to committee discussions away from the spotlight. Khera was a member of the COVID-19 pandemic committee until June 2020 and also sat on the public safety and national security committee. Khera spoke on the topic of international development on March 12 last year. In her speech, she laid out Canada’s role as an international power, helping in peacekeeping missions and offering women and girls access to modern contraceptive methods around the world. She responded to comments from NDP and Conservative MPs, playing a central role in the discussion. Then she went silent. Khera does not have a record in Parliament again until December 7, 2020. Khera finally spoke in the legislature to make a lengthy speech about Global Affairs Canada, highlighting the role it has played around the world. She spoke about work to find solutions for “protracted political crisis (sic) in … Ukraine and Venezuela and in the Middle East”. Khera again held an important role in the conversation, fielding multiple questions from opposition members. Two days later, she rose to wish her constituents a happy holiday season. Then she quietly left for the United States. After her trip and resignation from her roles, Khera was given a less important responsibility. Her first speech in Parliament after the controversy came at the beginning of February when she spoke during Statements by Members. The time is specifically dedicated to general announcements which are made unopposed and are not part of a wider debate. On February 18, Khera made another brief speech under Statements by Members. By May 12 of this year she seemed to return to a more prominent role. Khera gave a long speech in Parliament about sexual misconduct within the military. The Liberal fielded multiple questions from other members on the topic, defending her government’s controversial record and admitting more still needed to be done. The majority of Khera’s public legislative effort, when she did speak, was national. She did not table any motions or bills herself over the past two years, acting as a loyal supporter of legislation championed by Liberal colleagues. On several occasions she defended or promoted laws that advanced the Party’s mandate. One example early in the year of her more pronounced advocacy was when spoke at length in February about Bill C-7 (to amend medical assistance in dying laws) and Bill C-5 (to change rules around sexual assault cases and judges). “It is an honour for me to speak to Bill C-5,” she said in one such speech. “As members know, if passed, this proposed piece of legislation will amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code to require newly appointed provincial superior court judges to participate in training on sexual assault and the social context in which it occurs. Judges are expected to apply the law in a manner that is respectful of the dignity of survivors. Training on sexual assault law and the social context in which the sexual assault occurs will help to ensure that they have a full understanding of the complex nature of sexual assault when presiding over such cases.” Khera was less vocal — but not silent — about her home riding. During the pandemic, her city’s status as one of Canada’s worst-hit areas was referenced as an issue on her radar. Speaking about residents in Brampton West and her time as a nurse, she raised Brampton’s hotspot status several times. The diversity of her riding was another issue mentioned in the legislature. Pushing the need for Liberal reform of the childcare sector, Khera told her colleagues that her residents were among the youngest in the country. She also referenced Brampton West during Black History Month in both 2020 and 2021; 19 percent of all residents in the riding are Black compared to a Peel average of about 10 percent, according to the 2016 Census. “Not only is my riding one of the fastest-growing in the country, but Brampton West is home to Canada's largest Black community,” she claimed in February 2020. “In honour of Black History Month, although the list is extensive, I would like to recognize local leaders in my riding who make Brampton West a better place every day.” It was a mostly performative statement and did not come with any initiative for tangible action. Khera’s expense records show appealing to diverse constituents was top of mind. She spent public money taking out advertisements with the Toronto Caribbean Newspaper, Asian Television Network, Parvasi Weekly, Gurbaz Punjabi Media and Asian World Today. While these advertisements doubtless increased her profile at the expense of Canadian taxpayers, they also show Khera uses local and culturally relevant communication to reach her constituents during the ongoing pandemic. Khera is seeking reelection in a race against Jermaine Chambers for the Conservative Party of Canada and Gurprit Gill for the NDP. Rahul Samuel will represent the People’s Party of Canada, while the Green Party does not have any candidates in Brampton. Email: isaac.callan@thepointer.com"
"2022-03-25","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Sept. 9 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Sept. 9 ... What we are watching in Canada ... After an occasionally testy French-language debate, five federal party leaders are licking their wounds and prepping their zingers ahead of tonight's first and only faceoff in English. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul took part in yesterday's showdown and will convene again at 9 p.m. eastern time. The debates come as opinion polls suggest the Liberals and Conservatives are stuck in a tight two-way race, with the NDP and Bloc poised to determine which of the two main parties emerges victorious. The topics discussed Wednesday included health transfers to the provinces, child-care funding, climate and the COVID-19 pandemic as the politicians sought to sway francophones ahead of the election on Sept. 20. Much of the back-and-forth Wednesday revolved around health care and how to pay for it. Moderator Patrice Roy pushed the politicians to spell out how much money they would give the provinces, and whether they would hand over the extra $28 billion in annual funding requested by premiers. Trudeau pledged an added $25 billion, but ""not unconditionally,"" while O'Toole reiterated his plan to boost health transfers to the provinces by $60 billion over 10 years, ""without conditions because it is a matter of respect"" — a word he used repeatedly when referring to Quebec. Paul brought a personal touch to the federal debate — the first for the 11-month Green leader — noting her father's death in a long-term care home during the pandemic's second wave. She also said she sees Greens as “allies” to First Nations, citing her own experience as part of a diaspora robbed of its traditional culture. Singh said he would ""completely agree"" that Indigenous languages should be recognized as official, going further than other leaders asked on the topic Wednesday. --- Also this ... A new report says costs for a COVID-19 patient treated in intensive care can climb to an estimated $50,000 compared with about $8,400 dollars for someone who's had a heart attack. The Canadian Institute for Health Information report says the cost for a pneumonia patient being in ICU is about eight-thousand dollars. But it says COVID patients remain there for much longer and, on average, their treatment amounts to about $23,000. The report covers data from between January 2020 and March 2021. It says COVID-19 cost Canada's health-care system a billion dollars during that time, but it excludes costs for doctors and all costs for Quebec. Health economist Walter Wodchis of the University of Toronto's school of public health says there are many other costs related to the pandemic, including the mental health toll, particularly on youth, and a rise in deaths from the opioid crisis. He says all those costs should be considered and there needs to be a general discussion on how to allocate scarce health-care resources. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee that towered over the city for generations has been taken down, cut into pieces and hauled away. It happened as the former capital of the Confederacy erased the last of the Civil War figures that once defined its most prominent thoroughfare. Hundreds of onlookers erupted in cheers and song as the more than six-metre-tall bronze figure was lifted off a pedestal and lowered to the ground. The removal was a major victory for civil rights activists. Their previous calls to dismantle the statues had been steadfastly rebuked by city and state officials alike. “It’s very difficult to imagine, certainly, even two years ago that the statues on Monument Avenue would actually be removed,” said Ana Edwards, a community activist and founding member of the Virginia Defenders for Freedom Justice & Equality. “It’s representative of the fact that we’re sort of peeling back the layers of injustice that Black people and people of colour have experienced when governed by white supremacist policies for so long.” Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam ordered the statue’s removal last summer amid the nationwide protest movement that erupted after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. But litigation tied up his plans until the state Supreme Court cleared the way last week. Northam, who watched the work, called it “hopefully a new day, a new era in Virginia.” “Any remnant like this that glorifies the lost cause of the Civil War, it needs to come down,” he said. The sculpture was installed in 1890 atop a granite pedestal about twice that tall. It was perched in the middle of a state-owned traffic circle, and it stood among four other massive Confederate statues that were removed by the city last summer. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... PARIS — The trial of 20 men accused in a series of co-ordinated attacks on Paris in 2015 that spread fear across Europe and transformed the nation has opened in a custom-built complex embedded within a 13th-century courthouse. Nine Islamic State group gunmen and suicide bombers struck within minutes of one another at several locations around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The attacks left 130 people dead. It was the deadliest violence to strike France since the Second World War. The worst carnage was at the Bataclan concert hall, where three men, dressed in black and armed with assault rifles, gunned down scores of people and grabbed a handful of hostages. Others targeted the national soccer stadium, where the president was attending a game, as well as cafes filled with people on a mild autumn night. The key defendant, Salah Abdeslam, has so far refused to speak to investigators. Abdeslam, whose brother was among the suicide bombers, appeared in court Wednesday dressed all in black, mask included. He declared his profession to be “fighter for Islamic State” and later burst out with complaints about treatment in prison. Abdeslam is the only defendant charged with murder. The other defendants face lesser terrorism charges. The presiding judge, Jean-Louis Peries, acknowledged the extraordinary nature of the attacks — which changed security in Europe and France's political landscape — and the trial to come. France only emerged from the state of emergency declared in the aftermath of the attacks in 2017, after incorporating many of the harshest measures into law. “The events that we are about to decide are inscribed in their historic intensity as among the international and national events of this century,” he said. The trial is scheduled to last nine months. --- On this day in 1954 ... Sixteen-year-old Marilyn Bell became the first person to swim across Lake Ontario. Bell started her swim the previous day from Youngstown, N.Y. She swam for 20 hours and 57 minutes under gruelling conditions, fighting five-metre waves and lamprey eels attacking her legs. About 300,000 people were on hand when she came ashore in Toronto. Bell continued her long-distance efforts and in 1955 became, at the time, the youngest person to swim the English Channel. --- In entertainment ... ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Bob Odenkirk is back shooting “Better Call Saul,” six weeks after a heart attack. Odenkirk tweeted a photo of himself getting made up to play title character Saul Goodman in the AMC series, indicating that shooting had resumed on its sixth and final season. Odenkirk said on Twitter: “Back to work on Better Call Saul!”"

(In 2012, 14-year-old Annaleise Carr completed the crossing to raise funds for a summer camp for children with cancer.) In 1984, the Progressive Conservative party under Brian Mulroney amassed the largest majority in Canadian electoral history. The Tories won 211 seats in the 282-seat House of Commons, leaving only 40 seats for John Turner's Liberals, 30 for the Ed Broadbent's New Democrats and one for an independent candidate. Mulroney defeated the same opponents in 1988 to win a second, but smaller majority. He resigned as prime minister in 1993. In 1985, on the first anniversary of her husband's sweep to power, Mila Mulroney gave birth to son Daniel Nicholas Dimitri. In 1987, the location of the biggest dinosaur nest in the world was revealed in the Badlands, 80 kilometres east of Lethbridge, Alta. Fetuses in the dinosaur eggs were the first ever uncovered.

In 2012, Quebec voters returned the separatist Parti Quebecois to power after nine years in opposition, albeit with a minority government. PQ leader Pauline Marois became the first female premier of the province. (In 2014, Philippe Couillard led the Liberals to a majority win as voters rebuffed the PQ's agenda for a possible third sovereignty referendum and its divisive secular charter. Marois lost her riding and resigned.) In 2014, former NHL rookie Steve Moore's multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Todd Bertuzzi and the Vancouver Canucks over the infamous on-ice attack in 2004 was settled shortly before it was set to go to trial.

The charge sheet listed a total of seven counts against Ortis under the various provisions, two of them dating from as early as Jan. 1, 2015, through to Thursday, Sept. 12 when he was arrested. The RCMP said the charges stemmed from activities alleged to have occurred during his time as a force employee, suggesting he was active with the Mounties upon being taken into custody.

The Middlesex-London Health Unit said the youth was in the intensive care unit with a severe pulmonary illness. The vaping-related illness was believed to be the first confirmed case in Canada. An article, published November 21st in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, was written by six doctors who treated the 17-year-old boy during a 47-day hospital stay. They said he went from being in perfect health to being on life support after just five months of regularly using e-cigarettes.

The picture was taken at an “Arabian Nights” party at a B-C private school. Another two photos and then a video soon emerged showing Trudeau also in ""blackface."" That left Trudeau apologizing for what he called a terrible mistake and that he was angry with himself for being so dumb. Time magazine posted the photo, which was published in the yearbook from the West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver where Trudeau worked as a teacher before entering politics. Trudeau says when he sought public office he never told anyone that he had worn ""blackface"" years earlier because he was too embarrassed. He says he acted as a person raised with privilege that blinded him from the realities of racism.

The Bloc leader was already in self-isolation, along with much of his caucus and other aides, after a staff member contracted COVID-19. Hours later, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole also tested positive for COVID-19. Quebec Premier Francois said he would get tested because he had met with O'Toole earlier in the week.

"2021-08-22","Full text: While local officials in Kanesatake continue to maintain a proactive approach to dealing with COVID-19, many are breathing a sigh of relief as cases have been consistently dwindling in the community. Standing at nine active cases, Kanesatake Health Center Planning and Response Unit spokesperson Robert Bonspiel said authorities are doing all that is necessary to contain the outbreak. “We’re confident that the community is once again secured, but we’re also cautiously opti​​mistic based on the premise that we have not seen these numbers in the community ever before,” noted Bonspiel. The outbreak declared last week preceded an initial case confirmed on Thursday, August 5. In the following days, a total of 17 active cases, including two non-local individuals working in the community, had been identified. “We’re taking it in stride right now since the situation is currently contained,” said Mohawk Council of Kanesatake (MCK) grand chief Victor Akwirente Bonspille. As schools prepare to reopen, the grand chief asserted that all needed measures will be taken in order to ensure the safety of community youth. Out of the infections reported in Kanesatake within the last two weeks, Public Health authorities established 90 percent of cases to be the Alpha variant. First identified in the United Kingdom, Alpha was categorized as a variant of concern by Health Canada on May 14. The federal health department states attributes of the strain include evidence of increased transmission, as well as increased severity of effects for infected individuals. The health centre recently conducted an assessment of Kanesatake’s vaccinated population which, for the first time, took into consideration the number of registered band members living outside the community. “Once we had taken into account all these numbers, our realistic percentage for those vaccinated was at 45 percent,” said Bonspiel. “This means that over half of the community is still very vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak and to its effects.” In comparison, 75.2 percent of Quebec’s total eligible population received at least one dose on August 20. An impromptu vaccination clinic was held on Wednesday, August 11, in an effort to encourage more Kanehsata’kehró:non to receive the vaccine. After a total of 55 members attended the walk-in clinic, Bonspiel continues to remind community members to call the health centre as there is still ample time for them to receive the vaccine. To mitigate any further spread of the virus, the health department and MCK also organized three separate testing clinics on August 12, 13, and Tuesday, August 17. During those three days, 110 tests were performed, with the largest turnout being on Tuesday, with 55 individuals. “A large part of the reason why we stepped up with the testing clinics was to make it easier for the parents, families, and daycare staff coming back,” explained Bonspiel, referring to the members affected by the positive case identified at the Tsi Rontswa’takhwa daycare on Friday, August 6. While a community outbreak was coming, Kanesatake’s operations to deal with the pandemic was also in the works. Elections held on July 31 resulted in a major shift in the MCK administration, along with departments such as the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) previously in charge of overseeing the COVID-19 situation. At the end of July, the Kanesatake Health Center Planning and Response Unit was instituted following the disbanding of the ERU. Amid these changes, the health center and council rapidly joined efforts in this continued battle for the well-being of Kanehsata’kehró:non. With all hands on deck, Bonspiel cautions Kanehsata’kehró:non of both the individual and collective risks the community is being faced with. “At one point, we had four individuals all under 40 years old in the hospital – that in itself was worrisome,” he said, adding that one community member remains in the hospital today. “We saw double vaccinated individuals showing smaller symptoms. But again, the worry isn’t so much about the symptoms, rather than the ability to transmit to other individuals in the community that aren’t vaccinated.” laurence.b.dubreuil@gmail.com Subject: COVID-19 vaccines; Community; Clinics; Coronaviruses; Disease transmission"

In 2018, former cricket star and longtime politician Imran Khan was sworn in as Pakistan's prime minister despite protests by opposition parties, which accused the security services of intervening on his behalf in July's elections. In 2020, everyone in attendance wore a mask and the chairs were spaced well apart in Rideau Hall as Chrystia Freeland was sworn in as Canada's first female finance minister. Freeland removed her mask as she took the oath, then replaced it before bumping elbows with the prime minister and the governor general. The special precautions were put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In 2020, Dale Hawerchuk, who became the face of the Winnipeg Jets en route to the Hockey Hall of Fame, died at the age of 57. In 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the COVID-19 pandemic called for a reset of the government's agenda, and he asked Governor General Julie Payette to prorogue Parliament until late September. In 2020, Joe Gosnell, a renowned treaty negotiator, politician and leader of B.C.'s Nisga'a Nation, died at the age of 85 following a long battle with cancer. A hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan, Gosnell was president of the nation when the landmark Nisga'a Final Agreement was completed in 2000. The treaty gave the Nisga'a control over their land, including forestry and fishing rights, and was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s. In 2020, Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita announced his resignation on state television. It came hours after he was detained by mutinous soldiers firing shots outside his home. Soldiers seized weapons in the garrison town of Kati and advanced on the capital. Mali had seen more than two months of regular demonstrations in which anti-government protesters demanded that Keita step down. In 2020, the Democratic Party formally made Joe Biden its presidential nominee. Delegates from each state took a roll call vote during the second night of the virtual Democratic National Convention. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Womens health; Governor General-Canada; Peace; Age; Coups d'etat; Politics; World War II; Presidents; Nobel prizes; Demonstrations & protests; Abortion; Coronaviruses; Military personnel; Prime ministers; Military history; COVID-19"

In 1346, King Edward III defeated the French at the battle of Crecy. In 1498, in Rome, Italian artist Michelangelo was commissioned by Pope Alexander VI to carve the Pieta Mary lamenting over the dead body of Jesus Christ, whom she holds across her lap. The work was completed in 1501. In 1768, James Cook left Britain to explore the Pacific for the first time. He was chosen by the Royal Society of London to visit Tahiti to observe and document the planet Venus to help scientists calculate the distance of the earth from the sun. He also had a sealed envelope with orders from the Royal Navy to be opened at the end of the scientific work. The navy wanted him to find a southern continent that mapmakers thought existed and claim it for England. He visited both Australia and New Zealand and concluded neither were this southern continent. In 1784, Cape Breton, the island at the eastern extremity of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, was separated from Nova Scotia as one of several separate jurisdictions created for the United Empire Loyalists. It became part of Nova Scotia again in 1820. In 1819, Albert, husband of Queen Victoria and prince consort, was born in Bavaria. In 1833, British Capt. John Ross and his shipwrecked crew of 19 were rescued off Baffin Island. They had survived four winters with the help of the Inuit. Using shipwrecked boats they had found and fixed, the men set sail through a lane of water that opened up leading northward, and were rescued by Ross's flagship, the whaler ""Isabella."" Ross was a seaman for most of his life, entering naval service at the age of nine. He was wounded in the Napoleonic Wars. On his return to England from Baffin Island, Ross was knighted. He died in England in 1856, at age 79. In 1834, future prime minister John A. Macdonald began practising law in Kingston, Ont. In 1843, the first typewriter was patented. In 1850, Louis-Philippe, the last king of France, died. Chosen as king in 1830 following the overthrow of Charles X, Louis-Philippe reigned over an 18-year period in which the country prospered. Opposition to his government grew, however, and he was forced to escape to England after abdicating during the February Revolution of 1848. In 1861, Toronto's Yonge Street line, the first street railway in Canada, opened. In 1875, English novelist John Buchan was born. As Baron Tweedsmuir, Buchan became Canada's 15th governor general in 1935 and instituted the Governor General's literary awards. In 1910, humanitarian and Nobel Peace laureate Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in present-day Skopje, Macedonia. The Roman Catholic nun devoted her life to the destitute and died in Calcutta, India, on Sept. 5, 1997. (On Sept. 4, 2016, Pope Francis declared Mother Teresa a saint.) In 1920, the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing American women the right to vote, was certified in effect by Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby. In 1939, the first televised major league baseball games were shown on experimental station W2XBS. A double-header between the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. (The Reds won the first game, 5-2, the Dodgers the second, 6-1.) In 1940, the Royal Air Force bombed Berlin for the first time in retaliation for attacks on London. In 1951, Toronto Maple Leaf defenceman Bill Barilko was killed in a plane crash during a weekend fishing trip in Northern Ontario. Barilko, who was 24, had scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in overtime against the Montreal Canadiens four months earlier. The crash site was not found until 1962, five weeks after the Leafs won their first Cup since Barilko's goal. In 1958, the Board of Broadcast Governors was established to regulate broadcasting in Canada, independent of the CBC. The board was replaced 10 years later by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission. In 1961, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker opened Canada's Hockey Hall of Fame at the Canadian National Exhibition grounds in Toronto. The hall moved into a restored bank building in downtown Toronto in 1993. In 1972, Sir Francis Chichester, who circumnavigated the world alone in 1966-67, died. In 1974, Charles Lindbergh, the American aviator who made the first solo, non-stop transatlantic flight, died at Kipahulu, Hawaii. He was 72. In 1977, Bill 101, the Parti Quebecois language legislation, was passed in the Quebec national assembly. The bill declared French as the official language of the province and placed restrictions on English-language education. In 1978, Cardinal Albino Luciani of Venice became the 264th pope of the Roman Catholic Church following the death of Pope Paul VI. He took the name of John Paul I, but died only 34 days later. In 1986, in the so-called ""preppie murder case,"" 18-year-old Jennifer Levin was found strangled in New York's Central Park. Robert Chambers later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and served 15 years in prison. In 1987, the historic 80-year-old music building at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto was gutted by a fire. In 1991, Canada extended full diplomatic recognition to the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Canada never recognized the 1939 Soviet annexation of the Baltic states but had not retained diplomatic ties because of the overwhelming control exercised by the Soviet Union. In 1996, former South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled with an iron fist for nearly nine years, was sentenced to death on charges of mutiny and treason for masterminding a military coup in 1979. His successor, Roh Tae-woo, was also found guilty of mutiny and treason and sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison. In 1997, former South African president F. W. de Klerk resigned as leader of the opposition and retired from politics. While in power, de Klerk helped dismantle apartheid and clear the way for all-race elections. In 2003, a scathing U.S. government inquiry report concluded that a chunk of foam that struck ""Columbia’s"" wing downed the shuttle, but the root cause of the fatal crash was the culture at NASA, which for two decades had sacrificed safety in the pursuit of budget efficiency and tight schedules. In 2006, environmentalist Elizabeth May was elected the new national leader of the Green Party. In 2008, Russia formally recognized the breakaway Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia at the heart of its war with Georgia, heightening tensions with the West. In 2008, Major League Baseball announced umpires would be allowed to check video on home run ""boundary calls"" starting Aug. 27. In 2009, authorities in California solved the 18-year-old disappearance of Jaycee Lee Dugard, who appeared at a parole office with her children and the Antioch couple accused of kidnapping her when she was 11. (In April 2011, Phillip and Nancy Garrido pleaded guilty to kidnapping and rape. Philip was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison and his wife, Nancy, was given a 36-year term.) In 2010, Misbahuddin Ahmed, Khurram Syed Sher and one other man under a publication ban, all Canadian citizens, were arrested by RCMP in an alleged Ottawa-based terror plot to bomb government buildings and public transit systems. (Sher was acquitted while Ahmed was found guilty of conspiring to knowingly facilitate a terrorist activity and participation in the activities of a terrorist group, but acquitted of possession of explosives with intent to do harm. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.) In 2011, Aloysius Cardinal Ambrozic, the retired archbishop of Toronto, died after a lengthy illness. He was 81. Ambrozic served as the ninth archbishop of Toronto from 1990-2006. In January 1998, former pope John Paul nominated him as Cardinal, which allowed him to take part in the conclave of 2005 that elected Pope Benedict. In 2011, in B.C., 54 per cent of the 1.6 million ballots cast voted to dump the HST in a historic mail-in referendum, forcing the provincial government to revert to the PST and having to pay back $1.6 billion to Ottawa. (It took effect April 1, 2013). In 2014, Miami-based Burger King announced an $11-billion merger agreement with Tim Hortons that would form the world's third-largest quick service restaurant company. In October, Canada's Competition Bureau approved the deal and Ottawa signed off on it in December. In 2015, WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot to death during a live remote broadcast in Virginia by their former colleague, a disgruntled journalist who also recorded himself carrying out the killings and then posted the video on social media. The person being interviewed was also shot but she survived. The gunman crashed his vehicle during a police chase and then shot himself, dying hours later in hospital. In 2017, boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. let UFC star Conor McGregor have the early rounds before dominating late and stopping him with a TKO in the 10th, but McGregor fared much better than anticipated in his first pro fight. Mayweather improved to 50-0, passing Rocky Marciano's benchmark record of 49-0. The spectacle brought Mayweather an estimated $300-350 million, while McGregor earned $100 million. In 2018, Pope Francis issued a sweeping apology for the ""crimes"" of the Catholic Church in Ireland, saying church officials regularly didn't respond with compassion to the many abuses children and women suffered over the years. In 2018, Playwright Neil Simon, a master of comedy whose laugh-filled hits such as ""The Odd Couple,"" ''Barefoot in the Park"" and his ""Brighton Beach"" trilogy dominated Broadway for decades, died at 91. In 2018, Canada's Brooke Henderson shot a final-round 7-under-par 65 for a 21-under total at the Wascana Country Club to win the CP Women's Open. It was the first time a Canadian had won the national Open since 1973. It was the seventh career LPGA Tour win for the 20-year-old from Smiths Falls, Ont., and second victory of 2018. In 2020, police in Antioch, Ill., arrested a teenager on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide after two people were shot to death during a night of unrest in nearby Kenosha, Wis. A man was caught on cellphone video opening fire in the street with a semi-automatic rifle and could be heard saying ""I just killed somebody."" The shooter claimed self-defense after several street confrontations with various individuals throughout the chaotic night. In 2020, Arnold Spielberg, the father of filmmaker Steven Spielberg and an innovating engineer whose work helped make the personal computer possible, died at 103. Spielberg and Charles Propster designed a mainframe computer in the late 1950s that would allow computer scientists to develop a programming language that would be essential the rise of personal computers decades later. Arnold Spielberg said in a 2016 interview that he tried to get his son interested in engineering, ""but his heart was in movies.'' In 2020, players from six NBA teams decided not to play post-season games, in a boycott that quickly reverberated across other professional leagues. Players made the decisions to protest the shooting by police of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. ---- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Governor General-Canada; Professional baseball; Criminal sentences; Governors; Treason"
"2021-08-15","Full text: Today in History - Aug. 24 Today in History for Aug. 24: On this date: In 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted and buried the Italian cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, killing 20,000 people. In 410, the Visigoths sacked Rome, disillusioning Christians who were trusting in God’s protection of the ecclesiastical centre of early Christianity. St. Augustine later tackled this religious problem in his monumental work, ""City of God."" In 1456, in Mainz, Germany, volume two of the famed ""Gutenberg Bible"" was bound, completing a two-year publishing project, and making it the first full-length book to be printed using movable type. In 1572, thousands of Protestants were massacred throughout France by the Roman Catholics during what is known as the ""Massacre of St. Bartholomew."" In 1660, Pierre Radisson and his brother-in-law Chouart des Groseillers decided to form the Hudson Bay Co. after having a fortune in furs confiscated because they went west without the governor general's permission. The company was finally awarded a royal charter in the fur trade in 1670. Now known by the corporate nickname HBC, the company is in its fourth century of operations. In 1791, the British Parliament passed the Constitutional Act, which divided Canada into two provinces, Upper and Lower, each with its own lieutenant-governor and legislature. The act was made necessary with the great influx of United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolution. The English-speaking settlers did not want to live under French law or the Roman Catholic church. In 1814, British troops burned the White House in Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812. The British action was taken in retaliation for the American sacking and burning of York, now Toronto. A British fleet had landed earlier that August in Chesapeake Bay, and the troops under Gen. Robert Ross easily routed the 5,000 militiamen assembled to defend Washington. Ross's troops were unsuccessful in a later attempt to take Baltimore. In 1870, Metis leader Louis Riel abandoned Fort Garry when troops led by Col. Garnet Wolseley arrived to put down the Red River Rebellion. Riel, who had set up a provisional government that had put Ontario Orangeman Thomas Scott to death, fled to the United States. He later returned to Canada to organize the North-West Rebellion in 1885. In 1872, caricaturist and writer Sir Max Beerbohm was born in London. In 1876, Cree from central Alberta and central Saskatchewan agreed to live on reserves. In 1877, Alexander Graham Bell obtained the Canadian telephone patent. In 1891, Thomas Edison filed for the first patent on a motion picture camera. The camera, called a kinetoscope, took motion pictures on a band of film to be viewed by peeping into a box. Although the film lasted only 13 seconds, some of the camera's features are still in use today. In 1920, celebrated Canadian artist Alex Colville was born in Toronto. His family moved to Amherst, N.S. in 1929, and he studied at Mount Allison University, in Sackville, N.B. After graduation in 1942, he joined the army and was sent to Europe as a war artist. After the war, he taught at Mount Allison until 1963, when he resigned to paint full time. Colville went back to teaching a few years later working as visiting professor at University of California in 1967 and as a visiting artist in Berlin in 1971. He designed the coin that marked Canada's Centennial in 1967. On July 16, 2013, he died at his home in Wolfville, N.S. from a heart condition after years of coping with a variety of health issues. In 1922, Rene Levesque was born in New Carlisle, Que. Following a career in journalism, Levesque became a minister in Jean Lesage's Quebec Liberal government in 1960 and guided the nationalization of the province's private electric utilities, which became Hydro-Quebec. Levesque quit the Liberals in 1967 to found the pro-independence movement, which became the Parti Quebecois. Following the PQ's stunning 1976 election, Levesque's government passed Bill 101, which strengthened the status of French as Quebec's official language. But its sovereignty-association proposal was defeated in a 1980 referendum. The PQ was re-elected in 1981, but Levesque resigned under fire from sovereigntists within his party four years later. He died on Nov. 1, 1987. In 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to make a non-stop flight across the United States, flying from Los Angeles to Newark, N.J., in 19 hours and five minutes. In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- NATO -- was created by Canada, the U.S. and 10 European countries. In 1950, the first Canadian unit to reach the Far East in the Korean War arrived in Tokyo. In 1968, France became the world's fifth thermonuclear power when it exploded a bomb at a South Pacific testing site. In 1969, the American supertanker ""Manhattan"" left Chester, Pa., embarking on the first crossing of the Northwest Passage by a commercial ship. The aim was to prove the feasibility of that route for transporting Arctic oil. With the help of two other ships, including a Canadian icebreaker, the ""Manhattan"" reached Sachs Harbour, N.W.T., on Sept. 15. In 1974, the first Francophone International Youth Festival, with 25 French-speaking countries participating, ended at Quebec City. In 1980, Poland's government bowed to demands from striking workers and announced democratic trade union elections, as well as a liberalization of Poland's one-party political system. In 1981, Mark David Chapman was sentenced in New York to 20 years to life in prison for shooting music icon John Lennon to death the previous Dec. 8. In 1988, the general council of the United Church of Canada voted to consider all members for ordination, regardless of sexual orientation. It was the first time a Canadian church had made such a decision and caused great division within church ranks. In 1989, baseball great Pete Rose was banished for life from the game over allegations he bet on the sport. In 1990, three Canadian warships set sail for the Persian Gulf to participate in the blockade of Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait three weeks before. In 1991, Ukraine declared full independence. In 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as leader of the Soviet Communist party. His resignation effectively ended the world's first Communist state 71 years after it was born. Gorbachev ordered the seizure of all assets of the ruling Communist Party and appointed a new interior government composed of anti-communist reformers. In 1992, hurricane Andrew ripped across south Florida with walls of water and winds gusting to 265 km/h. More than one-million residents of southern Florida were ordered to flee their homes. At least 40 people were killed in Florida and Bahamas and damage to property was estimated at $20 billion. In 1992, engineering professor Valery Fabrikant opened fire on colleagues at Montreal's Concordia University. Four people died and Fabrikant was convicted of first-degree murder in 1993. At his trial he claimed he was driven to it because his work was being appropriated. In 1992, China and South Korea established diplomatic relations. In 1994, the PLO and Israel signed an agreement giving autonomy to Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on education, health, taxation, social welfare and tourism. In 1998, Gillian Guess was sentenced in Vancouver to 18 months in jail for obstructing justice. She had an affair with a defendant while serving on the jury that acquitted him and five other men charged in two gang-style slayings. In 1999, Onex Corp. chief executive Gerald Schwartz announced a $5.7-billion plan to buy Air Canada and its rival Canadian Airlines and merge them into a giant new Air Canada. The offer was killed by opposition from Air Canada, which later took over Canadian. In 2001, an Air Transat Airbus 330, on a Toronto-Lisbon flight, made a safe emergency landing on Terceira Island in the Azores after it ran out of fuel over the Atlantic Ocean because of a leak. Pilot Robert Piche, who glided the plane skillfully for 18 minutes over the ocean, was hailed as hero. In 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin formally acknowledged the wrongs inflicted on Ukrainian-Canadians who were interned and stripped of basic civil liberties during the First World War and allocated $2.5-million for commemorative plaques and educational tools. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union approved a new definition of a planet, stripping Pluto of its status and placing it in a new category known as dwarf planets. In 2007, two women died and 11 other people were injured after a hot air balloon caught fire and crashed in a trailer park in Vancouver. In 2011, Steve Jobs, the mind behind the iPhone, iPad and other devices that turned Apple Inc. into one of the world's most powerful companies, resigned as the company's CEO, saying he could no longer handle the job. Apple's chief operating officer, Tim Cook, was named CEO. (Jobs died on Oct. 5 at age 56. He had battled cancer since 2004 and had taken three leaves of absences). In 2012, confessed mass killer Anders Behring Breivik was declared sane by a Norwegian court and sent to prison for bomb and gun attacks that killed 77 people and injured 200 others in 2011. He received a 21-year sentence that can be extended for as long as he's considered a menace to society. In 2012, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency erased 14 years of Lance Armstrong's cycling career _ including his record seven Tour de France titles _ and banned him for life from the sport after concluding he used banned substances. (In October, cycling's governing body, Union Cycliste Internationale, accepted the USADA's findings.) In 2015, Canadian Shawn Barber won the country's first ever gold in pole vault at the world track and field championships in Beijing, and the first gold since Perdita Felicien won the 100-metre hurdles in 2003 in Paris. In 2016, a pre-dawn 6.2 magnitude earthquake levelled the central Italian towns of Amatrice, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto, killing 299 people - including one Canadian - and leaving thousands homeless. In 2017, Sen. Mike Duffy sued the Senate and the RCMP for the way they handled accusations about his expenses, seeking millions of dollars in damages and compensation for loss of income and benefits.

In 2017, Montreal Alouettes receiver Nik Lewis became the CFL's all-time pass receptions leader with 1,030, surpassing B.C. Lions great Geroy Simon. In 2018, Robin Leach, whose voice crystalized the opulent 1980s on the TV show ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,"" died at 76. In 2020, Erin O'Toole became the new leader of the federal Conservative party, winning the contest on the third ballot count. Peter MacKay placed second after coming out on top in the first round. Upwards of 175,000 party members cast a ballot. In 2020, Donald Trump was re-nominated as the Republican presidential candidate during a scaled-back roll-call vote at the Charlotte Convention Center in North Carolina. The vote was scaled back in observance of health protocols to control the spread of COVID-19. In 2020, the partner of a Black man shot and wounded by police in Kenosha, Wis., said she was sitting in the back seat of an SUV with their children when an officer opened fire. Laquisha Booker said Jacob Blake was not armed and that the children were screaming. Police responding to a call about a domestic dispute fired seven shots as Jacob Blake opened the door to the SUV and leaned into the vehicle with his back turned to the officers. The shooting set off a night of violent protests. --- (The Canadian Press) Subject: Cameras; Strikes; Christianity; Employment; Political parties; Sovereignty; Resignations; Acquittals & mistrials; Labor unions"
"2021-08-15","Full text: Those forests now burning south of Fauquier and Edgewood, and northeast of Winlaw? They’re not coming back. That’s the stark assessment of Greg Utzig, a Kootenay-based conservation ecologist who has studied how climate change affects forest regeneration for 20 years. “The forest in some places won’t be back at all, and in other places it will be very different from what is there today,” he told the Valley Voice. Utzig says the temperate forests of the Arrow, Slocan and Kootenay Lakes areas that locals love are going to be replaced in the next few decades by rock, scrub grass and dust, as a result of human-driven climate change. It won’t happen all at once, and not everywhere. But by 2080, it will be a very different looking Kootenays. That’s because the fires burning this year aren’t part of a usual cycle of destruction and forest regrowth, but the signal of a wholesale change in the ecosystem. A change to a climate likely much dryer, and certainly much hotter, he says. One that will far more closely resemble the southwest US, rather than our familiar temperate rainforest. After the fire We’re taught that fire is good for a forest. But that’s not completely true, all the time. Fire is certainly a regular part of the natural order, and in places like the East Kootenay the forest has adapted to thrive with fire every few decades. But Utzig has also studied forests near Revelstoke where there’s no evidence of fire affecting the ecosystem for hundreds of years. So when climate change-driven fires hit those areas, the forest isn’t adapted to it – and that ecosystem doesn’t recover. The size, frequency and intensity of the fires is also increasing. Trees may not have a chance to regrow to full size before being wiped out again. That is, if there are seedlings to replace the burned trees in the first place. “If they’re high intensity fires – which many of them are – because it’s so hot, it kills all the trees so there’s no seed source,” he says. “And so the forest doesn’t come back because there’s no seed.” With the canopy gone, and hotter-than-usual fires burning deep into the soil, the next generation of trees is being decimated, says Utzig. Those that do survive will wither away in the heat and parched conditions as average temperatures slowly climb 5-7°C in the coming decades. “They all need water to survive. So there’s incredible competition for water in a year like this, and the ones that don’t make it die,” he says. Other problems are complicating and reinforcing the destruction. Drought-weakened trees are prey to beetle infestation, killing them and increasing fire fuels; clearcutting reduces ecosystems’ resiliency; extreme weather events mean more blowdowns and lightning to spark fires in the dying woods. The cycle of destruction continues until there’s nothing left. And all that is happening so fast that traditional forest recovery is impossible. “So I’m not going to say all these areas are not going to re-forest,” says Utzig. “Some of them will, but the ones that are in the driest sites won’t.” And the species that do come back won’t be the familiar pine, cottonwood, birch and hemlock either, but ones more adapted to drought conditions and fire. “It won’t slowly transition,” he says. “A major burn will happen, then we may get two to three years of dry, and those areas won’t come back. Or, if the next two or three years are wet, well, they will come back for a while – until they burn next time.” Knapweed So are we looking at an Okanagan-style landscape in the future? “No, that’s too easy,” says Utzig. “Our models had to go much farther than that to find a similar climate match to where the Interior is heading. And it’s more like southern Idaho, Wyoming, even Nevada.” So what vegetation will likely replace the fires in those burn areas this year? “Knapweed,” says Utzig. It doesn’t sound like he’s joking. Hope It pays to have a gallows humour if you’re a climate scientist these days. But Utzig bristles at the suggestion there’s nothing that can be done to avoid the climate catastrophe. “There’s lots of things that could be done,” he says. “The first thing is, we can stop making it worse. “To say there’s nothing we can be doing is ridiculous. But finding the will to do it: that is the problem.”"

(Modern historians have disputed the account's likelihood.) In 1498, John Cabot, whose sea voyage to the east coast of North America laid the groundwork for English colonization of the New World, was given a 10-pound reward for his efforts by King Henry VII. Cabot had been searching for a route to Asia, where he believed he was when he landed at what is now Cape Race in Newfoundland. In 1519, Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan set sail on his voyage of discovery to the New World. In 1535, Jacques Cartier entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In 1792, during the French Revolution, a mob in Paris attacked King Louis XVI's palace. He was arrested and later convicted of treason and executed. In 1804, Francis II became emperor of Austria-Hungary. In 1809, Ecuador revolted against Spanish domination. Ecuador achieved independence in 1822. In 1821, Missouri became the 24th U.S. state. In 1840, Canada's first known balloon flight took place in Saint John, N.B. In 1846, the Smithsonian Institution was founded in Washington, D.C. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell made the first long-distance call, from his residence in Brantford to his assistant in Paris, Ont., 13 kilometres away. The call was preceded seven days earlier by the first telephone call from one building to another, between Bell and his uncle. The world's first definitive tests of the telephone were one-way transmissions. Bell, who was born in Scotland but lived a large part of his life in Canada, is considered one of the greatest inventors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Bell also worked on the photoelectric cell, the iron lung, desalination of seawater, the phonograph, and attempted to breed a super race of sheep at Baddeck, N.S. In 1921, Franklin Roosevelt was stricken with polio while vacationing at his summer home on Campobello Island, N.B. The man who later became one of America's most memorable presidents was on holiday at his family cottage from his job at a New York bank when he became feverish and his legs suddenly grew weak. He was 39 at the time. In 1932, movie canine ""Rin Tin Tin"" died at age 14. In 1935, Lord Tweedsmuir was appointed Governor General of Canada. In 1943, Prime Minister Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt met with military planners at Quebec City to discuss the invasion of France and Pacific campaigns. Since the other Allies were not represented at the conference of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King attended as host. Before the conference ended on Aug. 24, it was agreed that the supreme Allied commander of the invasion would be an American and that continuing aid would be sent to Chiang Kai-shek in China. In 1945, Japan announced its willingness to surrender and end the Second World War, provided Emperor Hirohito's status remained unchanged. In 1949, the first commercial jet plane to fly in the Western Hemisphere made its maiden flight over the Malton airport (now Pearson International) outside Toronto. The Jetliner C-102 was designed in Canada by an Englishman, James Floyd, and built by Avro of Toronto. It was never produced commercially. In 1950, Canada and United States signed the Niagara River Pact approving an increase in power output from the Niagara River. In 1953, Louis Saint-Laurent's Liberals were re-elected, winning an overwhelming majority in the federal election. Saint-Laurent first became prime minister in 1948, replacing a retiring Mackenzie King, and had the advantage of running Canada during the prosperous post-war years. His government created several large projects, including the Trans-Canada Highway, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Canada Council. In 1954, construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway began at Cornwall, Ont. A ground-breaking ceremony was held at Cornwall and Massena, N.Y. The waterway took five years to complete, was considered a monumental engineering and construction feat and opened ports on the Great Lakes to ocean traffic. In 1960, the Canadian Bill of Rights became law. The document applies only to those under federal regulations because consent of the provinces was not obtained. It recognizes the rights of individuals to life, liberty, personal security and enjoyment of property. It also protects equality before the law and freedoms of speech, religion, assembly and association, and the press. But the Bill of Rights does not have the legal force of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which became part of Canada's Constitution in 1982. In 1966, nine workers were killed and 59 injured when a span of the partially completed Heron Road Bridge collapsed into the Rideau River in Ottawa. In 1969, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were murdered in their Los Angeles home by members of Charles Manson's cult, one day after actress Sharon Tate and four other people were slain. In 1976, hurricane Belle smashed into the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut coastline, leaving millions of dollars in property damage. It eventually ended in the Gaspe region of Quebec after drenching New Brunswick. In 1977, the biggest manhunt in New York City history ended with the arrest of David Berkowitz as the ""Son of Sam"" killer, who murdered six people and wounded seven others in one year. He was later sentenced to 365 years in prison. In 1981, a 42-day post office strike ended as workers voted to accept a two-year contract that gave them a 12.5-per-cent raise. The post office became a Crown corporation a month later. In 1981, transatlantic air traffic was thrown into confusion when some Canadian air traffic controllers refused to handle flights to and from the United States. The controllers claimed a strike by U.S. air traffic controllers had made the skies unsafe. Normal operations resumed two days later. In 1982, Claude Ryan resigned as leader of the Quebec Liberal Party. In 1990, Canada announced it would send three ships and 800 sailors to the Persian Gulf as part of a multinational force massed to prevent Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from invading Saudi Arabia and to force him to withdraw from Kuwait. In 1995, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were charged with 11 counts each in the April 19 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in which 168 people were killed. McVeigh was convicted and sentenced to death. He was executed by lethal injection at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., on June 11, 2001. Nichols was convicted and sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. In 1995, a Guatemalan jet carrying 65 people, including three Canadians, crashed into a volcano in central El Salvador, killing all on board. In 1999, Ontario was named the second worst polluter in North America (after Texas) in a NAFTA report. In 2003, temperatures hit a record 37.7 C in London for the first time in recorded history. Throughout Europe, the summer of 2003 broke heat records, with some parts seeing temperatures soaring six degrees above normal. The weather was estimated to have caused the deaths of tens of thousands. In 2006, British authorities thwarted a terrorist plot to simultaneously blow up several aircraft heading to the United States using explosives smuggled in hand luggage. Twenty-four men were arrested in Britain. The arrests led to tough new restrictions on bringing liquids on flights. In 2008, massive explosions and fire at a propane storage facility in north-end Toronto neighbourhood forced the evacuation of thousands of residents and closure of highways and subway stations. One employee of the plant died. A firefighter who responded to the emergency call on his day off, also died after collapsing at the site. A 2010 report by the Ontario Fire Marshal's Office blamed the blast on a leak during an illegal propane transfer. In 2013, Sunrise Propane and directors Shay Ben-Moshe and Valery Belahov were found guilty of nine provincial-offences charges. In 2016, a judge imposed $5.3 million in fines against the company and its directors. In 2010, the World Health Organization declared the swine flu pandemic officially over. The WHO said at least 18,449 people had died worldwide since the outbreak began in April 2009. In 2010, in B.C.

In 2018, a Canadian gold mining company won the right to go after Venezuela's prized U.S.-based oil refineries and collect $1.4 billion it lost in a decade-old takeover by the late socialist President Hugo Chavez. In 2019, wealthy American financier Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in a New York jail after apparently committing suicide while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. An autopsy was to be conducted on the high-profile inmate with connections to celebrities and presidents who was accused of sexually abusing underage girls for years. Attorney General William Barr said two days later that the Justice Department had already found ""serious irregularities"" at the Manhattan jail where Epstein died and said the investigation would continue. In 2020, Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab delivered a brief televised speech to say he would step down from his job in the wake of an explosion at a port in Beirut. He blamed corrupt politicians who came before him for the explosion that killed at least 200 people and injured about six-thousand others. Diab's cabinet resigned earlier in the day following a weekend of anti-government protests. In 2020, the federal government named Winnipeg lawyer Isha Khan to be the new head of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. She became the first woman and the first person of colour in the post. The museum's board had apologized after an external report found systemic racism and other mistreatment was pervasive at the institution. In 2020, former professional wrestler James Harris died at the age of 70. The Mississippi-born sharecropper was better known as ""Kamala the Ugandan Giant.''

"2021-08-11","Full text: A look at what's In The News for Aug. 9 In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Aug. 9 ... What we are watching in Canada ... UNDATED — Canada is once again allowing U.S. citizens and permanent residents back into the country, provided they've been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. After 17 long months, a ban on non-essential travel across the Canada-U.S. border was finally eased at midnight, although the Americans have yet to lift their own limits on Canadian travellers. Eligible visitors must live in the U.S. and have allowed 14 days to pass since receiving a full course of a Health Canada-approved vaccine. They are also required to show proof of a negative molecular test for COVID-19 that's no more than 72 hours old and to use the ArriveCAN app or online web portal to upload their vaccination details. Fully vaccinated travellers who have recovered from the disease and are otherwise eligible to enter Canada can show proof of a positive molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days prior to crossing the border. Denis Vinette, vice-president of the travellers branch of the Canada Border Services Agency, says the agency learned a lot when fully vaccinated Canadian citizens were allowed to return under similar conditions last month. Vinette says about half had to be turned away during the first week because they hadn't received one of the four vaccines approved by Health Canada, or had not waited the full 14 days after their last shot. Canada has approved four vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot, also known as Covishield, and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson option. All except AstraZeneca have been approved and widely deployed in the U.S."

The work of the Red Cross grew to include aid to refugees, exchanges of sick and wounded soldiers and disaster relief. In 1876, Thomas A. Edison received a patent for his mimeograph. In 1900, the first Davis Cup tennis competition began in Brookline, Mass. The two-day event was won by the United States.

In 1937, Japan occupied Peking, now Beijing, in China during the Sino-Japanese War (1937-45). In 1940, the ""Battle of Britain"" began. The German Luftwaffe attempted to smash Britain's air defence and set up the country for invasion. But the badly outnumbered Royal Air Force mounted a defence that downed 1,733 German raiders by the end of October. The loss was too much for Germany, and the daylight raids were abandoned. In 1944, the Union Nationale, under Maurice Duplessis, returned to power following the Quebec provincial election. In 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan during the Second World War. In 1945, U.S. President Harry S. Truman signed the United Nations Charter. In 1963, the ""Great Train Robbery"" was staged in Britain. A total of C$7.5 million was stolen from a mail train in Buckinghamshire when a group of masked bandits stopped the Glasgow-to-London mail train before dawn 58 kilometres northwest of London. Ten men were convicted, but only a fraction of the loot was ever recovered. Ronald Biggs became infamous for escaping prison in 1965 and fleeing to South America.

The Bank of England was forced to intervene to support the pound when it came under the pressure of heavy selling. In 1974, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced his resignation, effective noon the following day.

In 1988, this date was the luckiest day of the 20th century according to the Chinese because the date is a palindrome: 8.8.88."
