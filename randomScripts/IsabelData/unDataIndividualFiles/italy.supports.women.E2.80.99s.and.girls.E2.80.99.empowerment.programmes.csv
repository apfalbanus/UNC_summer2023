Since 1980, the promotion of sexual and reproductive health and rights and the protection of women and girls have guided collaborative efforts between UNFPA and Italy. Initiatives that help communities develop economically and nurture resilience to deal with natural disasters and conflicts are critical to the Italian aid focus. Accordingly, collaboration with UNFPA on family planning and reproductive rights, which can lead to a demographic dividend as more young people are employed society, is a central mutual objective. In 2017, the Italian Government committed €1.4 million to UNFPA’s core budget, which allows for flexibility in programming to meet changing needs. Addition funding of nearly €6 million has been provided for initiatives in Afghanistan, Mozambique and Yemen, with discussions underway for additional support to programmes in priority countries Italian support to women’s empowerment and gender equality rests comfortably within its overarching approach to sustainable development through investments in human, economic, social and environmental programmes. Through this continued collaboration, UNFPA will be positioned to work closely with communities across the world to help achieve our shared goals for women and girls."
