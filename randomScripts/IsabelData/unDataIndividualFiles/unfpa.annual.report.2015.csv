The UNFPA mandate, set by the Programme of Action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, ICPD, has never been more relevant: not only is the ICPD’s focus on sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights central to sustainable development, but it is also critical to realizing a demographic dividend, which has the potential to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. UNFPA will continue to seize the opportunities offered by the new development agenda to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, and every young person’s potential is fulfilled—for the sake of people, planet and prosperity for all.
